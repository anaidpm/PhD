0,S1930043318302334,Pelvic tuberculosis: a forgotten diagnosis – case report," Case report An African14-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric disease department for investigation of an adnexal mass. Five months before admission, she immigrated to Portugal from Angola. One month after being in Portugal, she started feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, daily somnolence, and a persistent dry cough. She was medicated with an antihistaminic with some improvement of the cough. As the symptoms persisted, she had some laboratory tests, which showed microcytic hypochromic anemia that was medicated with iron replacement therapy. Two months later, she went to the emergency department due to aggravating symptoms, fever (of irregular pattern), weight loss (4 kg in 1 month), a low abdominal pain, and pain with inspiration in the right hemithorax. There was no associated past medical or surgical history and no history of recent disease in her family circle. She had no other signs or symptoms, namely, no menstrual disturbances (menarcha at 10 years), no urinary, respiratory (the cough subsided), or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination, a palpable painful hypogastric mass was found, hard on palpation and of irregular contours. A BCG vaccination scar was visible. She had an ultrasound (Fig. 1 ) that showed a large pelvic mass (about 12?×?8 cm), centered in the right adnexal area, predominantly cystic, complex, encapsulated, with multiple thin septa and a solid component that exhibited some vascularity in the Color Doppler study (Fig. 1b), creating a mass effect on the uterus and bladder. The left ovary was heterogeneous and mildly enlarged (not shown). There were associated terminal ileum, peritoneal thickening (Fig. 2 ), and mild ascitis. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR; Fig. 3 ) documented a complex cystic mass, apparently having its epicenter on the right adnexal area, with high signal in T2W sequences and intermediate-to-low signal in T1W sequence, with no saturation on fat-suppressed sequences. The multiple septa were thin, irregular, and had no definite enhancement on post gadolinium sequences. A solid enhancing component was not confirmed. Upon scrolling the sagittal images, the lesion suggested to be contiguous with the uterine horn and terminating at the right ovary, hence a hydropyosalpingitis was neither confirmed nor excluded. There was some distortion of ileal loops that were hard to characterize as they were retracted and adherent close together and in apposition with the mass. Despite this, the lesion seemed to be encapsulated and well defined. Some peritoneal enhancement was noted. No adenopathies were visible in the pelvis or in the lomboaortic chains. Chest radiograph (Fig. 4 a) revealed an obliteration of the right costophrenic angle extending upwards along the lateral wall, suggesting a loculated effusion. The corresponding chest ultrasound (Fig. 4b and c) exhibited a pleural effusionat the right lung base, anechogenic, with some thin septa, extending superiorly to the middle lung and causing passive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. Laboratory investigations elicited a normal leucogram and C-reactive protein (CRP), persistence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia (9.1 g/dL) and an elevated CA-125 (576 U/mL, normal values <35 U/mL). As an ovarian malignant tumor was suspected, she was submitted to an exploratory laparotomy with the intent of an eventual resection. A large right adnexal whitish mass was found, occupying the small pelvis, with an uninterrupted capsule, from which adhesions emanated to the bladder and ileon bowel walls, preventing it from resection. There was extensive perilesional inflammatory reaction, adherent to the peritoneal fat and lateral wall of the pelvic region, and multiple lesions with morphology suggestive of implants to the wall of the ileal loops in contact with the mass and in the peritoneum adjacent to the mass. The biopsy of the lesion revealed numerous granulomata with giant cells but no caseous necrosis and no evidence of neoplastic cells. Further laboratory testing revealed an elevated seric ADA (83 U/L, normal ranges being 4.8-23 U/L). As the results of the initial mass sample testing were nonspecific, she was submitted to an ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic lesion and a diagnostic thoracocentesis (also ultrasound guided). The tuberculin skin testing (TST/Mantoux) was marginally positive (13 mm). Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON testing was negative but further testing with IGRA T-SPOT was positive, substantiating the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis. Pleural liquid analysis revealed a very elevated LDH (1083 U/L, 5 times the normal seric value) and elevated ADA (188 U/L, normal being < 45 U/L), with normal leucocyte count. No BK was identified either by PCR or cultural exam. The mass aspirate was PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Almost 1 month later, cultural examination became positive for M. tuberculosis. She started antibacillary therapy with progressive symptomatic and overall improvement. After 8 months on combined antibacillary therapy, ultrasonography (Fig. 5 ) exhibited a residual complex cystic lesion in the right adnexal area, with some distortion of normal ovarian morphology. CA-125 returned to normal values. ",2
1,S193004331830339X,Rare radiological features of abdominopelvic tuberculosis: A case report," Case presentation A 26-year-old woman, para 1 lived 1, was referred to our medical center with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient noted that for the last 3 months she had been gradually experiencing intermittent vaginal bleeding, as well as progressive hypogastric and bilateral lower quadrants abdominal pain. The abdominal pain did not spread to any other spots and did not get relieved or aggravated by any factors. The patient noted that she had no history of any specific diseases. Furthermore, her menstrual cycles had always been regular and previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient also complained of weakness and 5 kg of weight loss (67–62 kg) in the past 3 months. The patient did not report the symptoms of urinary tract infection, coughing and sputum, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, recent travel, and history of any malignancies in her family. Upon examination, the blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg, temperature was 37.8?C, pulse rate was 88 bpm, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. There was a mild tenderness in both the lower quadrants without rebound tenderness. Her abdomen was mildly distended but the shifting dullness examination was negative and there were firm, mobile, and ill-defined edge masses in both lower quadrants. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography showed multicystic adnexal masses; because of the adhesions in the peritoneal cavity, it was impossible to identify peritoneal fluid collection from the cystic enlargement of the ovaries. For further evaluation, the abdominopelvic computed tomography scan was done which demonstrated a multicystic adnexal mass of 2.6?×?2.3 cm with an inaccurate site of origin and diffused nodular peritoneal and omental thickening (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's level of cancer antigen (CA), at 125, was more than the normal range (145 U/mL), but the alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotrophin levels were normal. Her chest X-ray was also normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a microcytic anemia, normal leukocyte count and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80 mm/hr). Laparotomy was performed on the patient due to the mass observed in the ovary and increased serum levels of CA-125 with the presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Lots of adhesions and ovaries covered with granulomatosis lesions were observed. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy were conducted and biopsies from the omentum and peritoneum were taken. Surgery was performed without any complications and no complications occurred postoperatively. Histopathology revealed that fragments of fibroconnective tissue contain numerous well-formed granulomas with extensive caseous necrosis, which was highly indicative of tuberculosis. After that, the result of acid-fast stains confirmed tuberculosis. After the diagnosis of tuberculosis, she underwent antituberculosis treatment.   ",0
4,S1110663818300041,Isolated nasopharyngeal tuberculosis in a 12?year old boy – A case report," Case report A 12?year old boy presented with nasal obstruction since 8?months. He had presented with open mouth and snoring during sleep. Anterior rhinoscopic examination revealed middle turbinate hypertrophy and pale appearance of nasal septum. Diagnostic nasal endoscopic examination showed vegetative mass with smooth surface at the nasopharynx (Fig. 1 ). Rest of the ENT examinations and routine blood investigations were within normal limit. Sputum microscopy and culture were negative for acid fast bacilli whereas bacteriological examination from nasopharyngeal swab showed acid-fast bacilli and the quenching probe PCR test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no evidence of active pulmonary and systemic tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT scan) was done to rule out any mass and its extent at the nasopharynx. CT scan showed large mass occupying the nasopharynx (Fig. 2 ). A bit of tissue was taken from nasopharynx with help of endoscopy under local anesthesia and histopathological examination revealed caseous granulomatous lesion, non-necrotizing granuloma under the ciliated respiratory mucosa. The granulation tissue showed coagulation necrosis and Langerhans type of giant cells at the center (Fig. 3 ). No malignant cells were seen and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Patient was treated with antitubercular therapy (ATT) of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9?months. Patient was clinically improved in third month of treatment and the nasopharyngeal mass was resolved around 4th month months of ATT. ",0
5,S2214442018300810,A case report: Addison disease caused by adrenal tuberculosis," Case report A 43-year-old man was admitted for the evaluation of Addison's disease. He complain of depression, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, joint pain, skin hyper-pigmentation, nails, mouth and mucous membranes of the lips. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal and neurologic examination showed no abnormalities. Laboratory serum cortisol <0.05 ?gr/dl (Normal range: 3.09–16.6 ?g/dL). Investigation of the causes of this adrenal hipofunction due to tuberculosis by blood sedimentation rate, Mantoux test show negative results. Following to Interferon Gamma Release Assay, IGRA test also show negative results. Upper abdominal MRI shows bilateral adrenal (right AP 5.59 × LL 5.56 × CC 4.46 cm; left AP 4.74 × LL 4.12 × CC 5.66 cm) with regular edges, bilateral adrenal hypertrophy suspects with differential diagnosis of adrenal adenomas (see Fig. 1 ). The patient underwent laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. RLD position, trochar 11 mm optic, with 2 working elements 5 mm. 1   Durante laparoscopic operation is obtained the adrenal gland enlarges, the consistency of various soft density, adhesions with around. The gross specimen macroscopically appears tubercle caseous (see Fig. 2 ). Preparation of hydrocortisone 100 mg a day before surgery to prevent the occurrence of adrenal crisis, serum cortisol increase to 32.18 ?gr/dl. 2  ,  3  The pathology report revealed tuberculosis of the adrenal gland (see Fig. 3 ). The cortisol level was measured at 30.85 ?gr/dl, the second postoperative day. Patients are routinely followed up in the Endocrine division. Hydrocortisone continued after surgery tapering down 10 mg/h; 7.5 mg/h; 5 mg/h; 2.5 mg/hr; 1 mg/hr and continue with oral hydrocortisone 25 mg daily. Blood pressure is 120/70?mmHg (without antihypertensive medication) and hypo cortisol symptom release. After the pathology results (adrenal TB) the patient is treated with a fixed drug combination of tuberculosis 5 tabs daily. ",0
7,S2210261218302311,Rare case of sacrococcygeal tuberculosis mimicking as an anal fistula," 2 Presentation of case A 93-year-old Japanese man who presented with gluteal and coccygeal pain was referred to our hospital. Furthermore, discharging were observed in his fistula in the posterior peri-anal region. He had neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. He had history of pulmonary TB at 25 years of age, and underwent surgery for the removal of complex anal fistula at 75 years of age at another institution. Based on clinical examination, there were two fistulous orifices between the anus and coccyx with purulent discharge (Fig. 1 ). He did not present with cough, fever, weight loss, and anorexia. The chest radiograph result was normal, and hematologic examination showed no abnormalities, except for a slight elevation in C-reactive protein level. Fistulography showed a complex supra-elevator track that is connected to the pre-sacral area and another track ending blindly behind the rectum. The connection between the track and the rectum or anus was not identified on fistulography (Fig. 2 ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole body reveled a lytic destruction of the sacrum (S3-5) and coccyx, with a low-density area in front of the sacrum, suggesting fluid collection (Fig. 3 A). No abnormality was found in the lungs and other vertebrae on CT scan. Colonoscopy findings showed normal colorectal mucosa and no evidence of fistula. Based on these radiological findings and the past medical history of the patient, the recurrence of complex anal fistula with osteomyelitis, or metastatic bone tumor of unknown origin, was suspected. Bacterial examination of the fistula discharge showed normal bacterial culture and was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). However, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using COBAS TaqMan MTB test (Roche Molecular Systems, the USA) was used to test the cold abscess fluid, and results showed that the patient was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AFB test and PCR were negative for sputum. However, the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, the UK) blood test result was positive. Thus, the diagnosis of isolated sacrococcygeal TB was confirmed. The patient was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 7 months. The patient’s pain resolved, and the purulent drainage stopped within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on the physical findings, closure of the fistula was not achieved. However, the PCR test result for PCR DNA turned to be negative. A follow-up CT scan was carried out during treatment, and results showed that fluid collection in front of sacrum had disappeared (Fig. 3B). ",0
8,S120197121830047X,A case-report of a pulmonary tuberculosis with lymphadenopathy mimicking a lymphoma," Case report A 22-year-old Somalian male was referred to the Respiratory Diseases Unit of the university hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, in June 2016. He complained of thoracic pain during his stay in an immigrant reception center, without reporting fever, cough, or any clinically significant comorbidities. The physical examination showed enlarged, not movable, and tender latero-cervical lymph nodes, as well as crackles in the right emi-thorax. Chest X-ray showed a right middle lobe atelectasis and increased bronchovascular markings. Blood examinations showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6g/dl (suspected hypochromic and microcytic anemia), a white blood cell count of 3,930 cells/mm3 (55% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes, 2% eosinophils), and a platelet count of 311,000 cells/mm (Davies et al., 2008). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (6.24mg/dl and 113mm/h, respectively); gamma-globulins on electrophoresis were high but without any monoclonal spikes. His renal and liver function tests were within normal range. Total IgE were 4,820IU/ml. Albumin level was below the normal values (4.00g/dl). A chest CT scan (Figure 1 ) with contrast infusion showed a generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly in the following anatomical sites: latero-cervical (sized ?25–50mm), supraclavicular, subclavian, mediastinal, and sub-diaphragmatic. Para-tracheal, para-cardiac, and right hilar lymph nodes were confluent and enlarged (diameter size: ?30–50mm); furthermore, a right middle lobe collapse, a tree-in bud parenchymal infiltrate, and a right shift of trachea and its bifurcation were found. Spleen showed multiple and rounded lesions. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were smear- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only lymphocytes (CD3+ 90%, CD4+ 68% CD8+ 17%, CD4+/CD8+ 4) were found in the BAL cellular count. A trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the right para-tracheal lymph node was performed; however, the histological pattern was not specific (i.e., non-specific chronic inflammation). Ultrasound scans suggested a lymphoproliferative disorder based on the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, liver enlargement, and small, multiple spleen abscesses. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node. A chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells and central necrosis was found in the histopathological examination. Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott, and Ziehl-Nielsen stained slides did not show any abnormal findings. Immunohistochemistry did not detect tumor cellular markers (i.e., AE1/AE3, CD3, CD20). Based on the clinical features, an empirical anti-TB treatment was started (ethambutol 1.2g/day, isoniazid 300mg/day, rifampicin 600mg/day, pyrazinamide 1.5g/day). However, his clinical conditions rapidly worsened (abdominal pain, vomit, fever, dehydration, elevated liver transaminases levels). One week after TB treatment initiation a left pleural effusion occurred (then, classified as TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). A sample of 2,000ml of pleuritic liquid was collected: it was limpid yellowish, with LDH level of 369U/L, total protein of 4.7g/dl, glucose of 60mg/dl, and PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After 47 days, a BAL culture conversion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurred. The drug susceptibility pattern did not show any drug resistances (i.e., isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Patient was discharged from hospital and underwent a new chest CT scan (Figure 1) after 6 months of treatment. It found an improvement of the atelectasis of the right middle lobe, and a decreased size of the subcarinal, right hilar, and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes. ",0
9,S1201971218345211,The use of bedaquiline to treat patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and end-stage renal disease: A case report," Case reports  Patient 1 In August 2016, a 46-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of pre-extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Two months before that visit, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary and peritoneal TB and had commenced first-line drugs. Subsequent phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) revealed pre-XDR-TB, after which he was transferred to our hospital (Table 1 ). The patient exhibited hypertension and ESRD (anuria requiring conventional hemodialysis three times weekly). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Baseline serum creatinine levels were 8.12mg/dl pre-hemodialysis and 3.97mg/dl post-hemodialysis. The baseline QTcF interval was 441ms on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, amikacin, moxifloxacin, cycloserine, linezolid, and bedaquiline after obtaining informed consent. Bedaquiline was started at 200mg three times weekly and was given for 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse reaction related to bedaquiline was encountered. One year after treatment initiation, amikacin and linezolid were permanently discontinued because of a hearing disturbance and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In April 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 607 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire course of treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 469ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.   Patient 2 In September 2016, a 53-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of MDR-TB. He had taken first-line drugs in 2013 and 2014 to treat drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Three months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB once more and placed on first-line drugs. Subsequent DST revealed MDR-TB, and he was then transferred to our hospital (Table 1). The patient exhibited hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C virus infection, and chronic kidney disease (average urine volume 1500ml/day without a requirement for maintenance renal replacement therapy). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for M. tuberculosis were negative. The baseline serum creatinine level was 3.04mg/dl (the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 21.7ml/min/1.73m2). The baseline QTcF interval was 424ms on ECG monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, amikacin, prothionamide, and cycloserine. Unfortunately, acute kidney injury developed 6 days later (the serum creatinine level increased to 5.1mg/dl, combined with oliguria), and amikacin was thus discontinued permanently. After 2 months, bedaquiline was added to the treatment regimen after obtaining informed consent. (Due to administrative issues, bedaquiline could not be started immediately after discontinuing the amikacin.) Bedaquiline was commenced at 400mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200mg three times weekly. In February 2017 (5 months after treatment commencement and 3 months after the addition of bedaquiline), the patient started conventional maintenance hemodialysis (three times weekly) because renal impairment had progressed. Bedaquiline treatment was continued unchanged for a total of 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse drug reaction related to bedaquiline was observed. Five months after treatment initiation, pyrazinamide was replaced by para-aminosalicylic acid because the patient developed gout. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In June 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 653 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 463ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.  ",0
10,S1413867015002147,Oral manifestation of tuberculosis: a case-report," Case-report A 61-year-old male patient with a history of smoking habit and alcohol abuse was being followed up for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy associated with vasculopathy, systemic hypertension, and chronic pancreatitis in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The patient was referred to the Stomatology Unit of the same hospital due to the emergence of lesions on the oral mucosa. Preliminary examination revealed two lesions, each measuring approximately 10mm across and presenting a granulomatous central portion and whitish halo. The lesions were located on the upper lip mucosa near the median line and on the left jugal mucosa adjacent to the labial anterior commissure (Fig. 1A and B, respectively). The patient complained of pain, productive cough for the past 15 days, night sweats, episodic fever in the morning, and slight weight loss in the previous two months. However, these complaints were intermittently made by the patient along the scheduled appointments, which may have added to the difficulty for an early diagnosis of the disease. Samples of lesions were collected by incision and stained according to the hematoxylin–eosin (HE) and Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocols. The pathological report was negative for the presence of alcohol–acid resistant microorganisms (Fig. 2 ). Due to the comparatively low count of microorganisms in the tissues analyzed, the special staining used did not successfully detect the presence of the bacterium. However, since a negative result in this kind of analysis does not rule out TB, a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage was analyzed according to the Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocol, with a positive result for M. tuberculosis. A radiograph of the thorax was suggestive of presence of active infectious disease, manifested as budding tree-like centrilobular nodules in both lungs, especially on the right. In this case report, the pathological analysis of the samples collected from the patient was not conclusive, requiring a Mantoux assay and the investigation of bronchoalveolar lavage in order to confirm the TB suspicion. The Mantoux protocol indicated a 13-mm inflammatory reaction confirming TB. Anti-HIV test was negative. The patient was referred to a pulmonologist for examination and treatment based on the pulmonary extension of the disease (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, 30 days into the treatment the patient died due to the worsening of clinical conditions, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney failure. ",0

14,S2211753916300598,Chronic Paracoccidioidomycosis with adrenal involvement mimicking tuberculosis – A case report from Austria," 2 Case A 62-year-old man was transferred from a community hospital to our department due to suspected diagnosis of reactivated tuberculosis of the lungs and adrenal glands in February 2015 (day 0). He reported left-sided chest and abdominal pain, weight loss of 12kg during the last 3 weeks as well as night sweats and cough. The punctum maximum of the abdominal pain was located at the left costal margin and aggravated at inspiration. Past medical history revealed several episodes of tuberculosis with involvement of the lungs, testes and adrenal glands ( Fig. 1). The patient reported that tuberculosis was diagnosed for the first time at the age of 7 years, followed by reactivations in the lungs with dissemination to the testes at the age of 14 and 21. Therefore, the patient had received tuberculostatic therapy, repeatedly. In 2010, he underwent CT-guided biopsy of a suspicious pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe and left adrenal gland due to considerable enlargement of adrenal glands. Based on the histopathological finding of epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis, the diagnosis of tuberculosis of lungs and adrenal glands was made. At that time, sputum smear, PCR and culture for acid fast bacilli were negative. Due to increasing size of the adrenal glands the patient underwent a second biopsy in the same hospital in 2012. Histopathological finding were similar to previous biopsy and again considered to be tuberculosis. From the year 1997 until 2001 he made yearly visits – each for several weeks - to a village in Regio de Pasco (Peru), a rural area located next to the rainforest of the Amazonas. He lived there in a house with a garden for approximately three years (2002–2004) and helped to construct a hospital. He did no agricultural or field work. During his stay in Peru he had no injury or disease worth mentioning. Except for two days in Arica (Chile) he did not visit any other South or Central American regions or countries. In addition, he reported that one day he recognized bats in the ceiling of his house and inhaled their excrements during cleaning. In addition to tuberculosis our patient had a past medical history of chronic bronchitis, Billroth II surgery due to peptic ulcer disease, cholecystectomy and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy approximately 10 years ago. The patient was a retired patient transport service driver in an Austrian hospital. Family history revealed a tuberculosis infection of his father. He was a current smoker with a history of 45 pack years, reported occasional alcohol consumption and no known allergies. He was on no chronic medication. Upon admission, the patient appeared in a good general condition with normal body temperature and a blood pressure of 120/70mmHg. Auscultation and percussion of lungs and heart were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft and showed periumbilical tenderness without resistance. Peripheral edema was not observed. Basic neurological examination and skin were unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with 78 beats per minute and no pathological findings. There was a mild eosinophilia (6%) and monocytosis (16%), but total white cell count (8.1G/l), hemoglobin (13.9g/dl), and platelet count (366G/l) were within normal limits. Levels of serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were normal. The concentration of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT, 193U/l), alkaline phosphatase (224U/l), and C-reactive protein (9.0mg/dl), plasma fibrinogen (560mg/dl), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 54/81mm) were elevated. Serum albumin (3.4g/dl) and sodium (135mmol/l) were slightly decreased while other electrolytes were normal. Myocardial biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin-T (hs-TnT), creatine kinase (CK) and muscle-brain type creatine kinase (CK-MB) were within normal range. Computed tomography (CT) showed postspecific pulmonary lesions. Compared to previous examinations, abdominal CT (day +0) revealed an increasing inhomogeneous enlargement of the adrenal glands (4.0×6.3cm) ( Fig. 2). Additionally, several enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenterial lymph nodes were found. Subsequently performed positron emission tomography (PET) (day +18) revealed an increased metabolic activity in bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands. Furthermore, hypermetabolic activity of cervical lymph nodes and the laryngeal area was found. Clinical and radiographic findings were suspicious for reactivation of tuberculosis. Interferon-gamma release assay (Quantiferon) (day +7) was positive but Ziehl-Neelsen smear, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of the sputum were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lues and adrenal autoantibodies were negative. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms such as tremor, disturbance of sensitivity and weakness of the extremities, triggered a neurological work-up. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (day +31) revealed a round temporo-parietal located lesion with perifocal edema, suspicious for infection or metastasis ( Fig. 3). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture (day +34) was unremarkable without any sign for infection, inflammation or neoplasm. Neurosurgeons did not consider surgical intervention. The cause of hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal enlargement remained unclear, initially. Tuberculosis was suspected but could not be confirmed by microbiology. Hence, CT guided biopsy of the left adrenal gland and extirpation of a right cervical lymph node (day +42) were performed for histopathological and microbiological work-up. Neither in the biopsy specimens of left adrenal gland nor the right cervical lymph node, Ziehl-Neelsen and PCR revealed any evidence for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (day +45). Serology for various systemic fungal infections and broad spectrum PCR from blood and aspirate fluids from biopsy (day +49) were negative as well. Histology of lymph node and left adrenal gland biopsy showed granulomas with central necrosis (day +48). In addition, in the left adrenal gland periodic acid–schiff (PAS), McManus, and methenamine silver stain (Grocott) revealed evidence of fungal pathogens. Giemsa stain of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen (day +49) showed characteristic yeast elements with multipolar budding of variable size thus indicating the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Fig. 4). Cultures of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen, were positive after incubation for 5 days (day +54) at 37°C and 28°C on Columbia agar (with 5% sheep blood; bioMérieux, Austria), 2% Sabouraud dextrose agar (Oxoid, Austria) and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI agar, Merck, Austria). Sequence analysis of the isolate confirmed the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sequence similarity was assessed by a search of homology not only with GenBank sequences, but also with the ISHAM ITS database. 100% identity was achieved with both databases (ISHAM identification number: MITS2102). Thus, we diagnosed paracoccidioidomycosis with dissemination to adrenal glands and highly suspicious involvement of cervical lymph nodes and the brain. When paracoccidioidomycosis was suspected, the specimen and all cultures were processed in a special laboratory for biosafety level 3 (S3-laboratory). This laboratory has all the equipment and safety features required for biosafety level 3 with controlled air flow and filtered ventilation systems. All personnel wore personal protective equipment (specialized clothing, gloves whenever handling the specimens or cultures). In accordance to this, personnel had the utmost protection against accidental infection. After identification of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antifungal treatment was initiated ( Table 1). In addition, replacement therapy with fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone was prescribed. Due to the evidence of cerebral involvement the patient was initially treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. The patient's general clinical condition improved and the antifungal therapy was switched to oral itraconazole. However, itraconazole never reached therapeutic level - neither with capsule nor liquid formulation, most probably due to the previous Billroth II resection. After deterioration of the patient and an increase in inflammatory parameters, liposomal amphotericin B was restarted. Associated with worsening of the systemic inflammation, hypotension, prerenal kidney failure and subsequent Addison crises occurred, so that hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone doses had to be adapted and high volume intravenous (IV) fluids substituted. Several ultrasound imaging studies showed a continuous decrease in size of the bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and a follow-up MRI of the brain revealed a shrinking size of the cerebral lesion. Overall clinical improvement was observed. After consultation of an infectious disease specialist, our patient was switched to oral posaconazole. Finally, the patient was discharged in a good general condition on oral posaconazole. ",0
15,S120197121834431X,First case of sexually transmitted asymptomatic female genital tuberculosis from spousal epididymal tuberculosis diagnosed by active screening," Case reports  Patient 1 (index case) A 54-year-old man noticed a swelling of the right epididymis approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. He was initially considered to have acute epididymitis. Although the causative organism could not be identified by urine testing, he was prescribed oral levofloxacin. The swelling of the epididymis recurred several times and was relieved by levofloxacin each time. However, approximately 1.5 years before the diagnosis, the left epididymis also started to swell gradually. A left orchiectomy was performed, because a tumor of the epididymis was suspected. Pathological findings of the resected testis revealed multinucleated giant cells and numerous caseous granulomas. He was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases because tuberculosis was highly suspected. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with epididymal tuberculosis based on urine PCR, urine culture, and histopathological findings. Additionally, a T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and HIV antibody test were both negative. Findings on chest computed tomography (CT) scan were unremarkable except for calcification of a mediastinal lymph node. He had been diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years earlier, which had been resected; there had been no recurrence at the time of presentation. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated was susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, levofloxacin, and streptomycin. Treatment was commenced with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a further 4 months.   Patient 2 (infected spouse) A 53-year-old woman visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Toranomon Hospital with her husband (patient 1) to inquire about the possibility of sexual transmission of tuberculosis approximately 1 month after his diagnosis. They were worried, although she looked healthy and had no symptoms: no fever, night sweats, weight loss, pelvic or abdominal pain, menstrual disorder, or respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and cough. She had been having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband once a week until 6 months before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. However, she had then refrained from sexual intercourse with her husband when they noticed the apparent swelling of his left epididymis because she was afraid of contracting a sexually transmitted infection from him. She had no past history of illnesses or operations, except for migraine at about 20 years of age and bilateral tubal ligation at about 35 years of age after the delivery of their third child. She reported having no other sexual partners after marriage. Finally, it was decided to perform active screening for genital tuberculosis even though she was asymptomatic. Laboratory findings of blood and urine testing were unremarkable. A T-SPOT.TB test and HIV antibody test were both negative. Chest and abdominal CT scans that included the pelvic area were unremarkable. Furthermore, a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound performed by a gynecologist were unremarkable except for a right ovarian cyst. A biopsy was not performed because no abnormal findings were observed in the endocervical canal or endometrium at that time. However, vaginal swab culture yielded M. tuberculosis and she was diagnosed with genital tuberculosis. Treatment for tuberculosis was started with the same regimen as that of her husband. Both M. tuberculosis isolates were sent to the Research Institute of Tuberculosis (Tokyo, Japan) for further analysis. Variable number tandem repeat analysis (VNTR, 24 loci) showed that the organisms from the two cases were identical (Iwamoto et al., 2012). Further analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS; MiSeq, Illumina) confirmed that the two isolates were genetically identical with only one nucleotide difference (Sekizuka et al., 2015).  ",0
17,S2214442014000941,Tuberculosis of the Spermatic Cord: Case Report," Case presentation A 44-year-old patient with no medical history of personal or family tuberculosis showed a 4-cm painful swelling on the right testicle, which had appeared 3 months earlier. The patient had not lost weight and showed no sign of infection. Testicle ultrasonography revealed an isoechoic, cylindrical, paratesticular structure, measuring 4 cm in its largest diameter. Routine blood and urine tests were within normal values with no inflammatory signs. Alpha Foetoprotein and beta Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin were normal. No tuberculosis skin test was performed. A surgery was performed, revealing an indurated right spermatic cord caught in a fibrous magma extending from the tail of the epididymis to the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 1 ). The fibrous cord was dissected and isolated from all the elements of the spermatic cord, with preservation of the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels. The testes were reinstated in purse. Histology showed on a 4 × 2 × 1 cm specimen, an epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomatous process with foci of caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). A checkup was made afterward revealing no other tuberculous location. The patient was given a 6-month antituberculous treatment: 2 (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol) + 4 (rifampicin + isoniazid) with a satisfying uneventful evolution. ",0
22,S221255311600008X,Chronic oozing skin lesions in children: Possible tuberculosis? Two case reports," Case 2 A 5-year-old female presented with multiple swellings and discharging sinuses (oozing thick, whitish fluid) over the skin of the left upper part of the neck and submandibular area. The surrounding skin was purple-blue in color with elevated edges. Six months later, the patient developed two upper-left cervical swellings and one submandibular swelling that was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics with no response. These swellings began to open by fistula to the outer skin, oozing thick white fluid (Fig. 4 ). The patient had no history of chest disease and no chest symptoms, and no contact history with a TB-related case. Routine biochemical analysis, complete blood count, and urine analysis were all normal. ESR was 70 for the 1st hour, and the chest radiograph was normal. The tuberculin test was positive (induration 22mm×24mm), and a quantiferon TB gold test was positive. Gastric lavage was negative for mycobacteria. Swabs from the discharging fluid were sent for pyogenic culture and culture for acid-fast bacilli. A neck ultrasound revealed multiple bilateral-cervical, left-supraclavicular, and left-axillary lymph nodes (LNs) ranging from 1.4cm to 1.7cm. Some of the cervical and supraclavicular LNs were forming cystic turbid abscesses from 0.7cm to 2.3cm in size. Skin and LN biopsy was done, with the skin showing dense dermal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells and minimal epithelioid granulomata and sinus-tract formation. The LN architecture was mostly replaced with caseating epithelioid granuloma with few multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 5 ). Both patients received Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. A scar is now present at the site of injection. The patient had no history of previous pulmonary TB since birth, and developmental and family histories were unremarkable, with no family members having a history of TB. ",0
23,S2352621116000061,A case report of atypical sarcoidosis misdiagnosed as tuberculosis," 2 Case report A 49 years old, female patient was hospitalized for abdominal discomfort, low grade fever (with the highest body temperature to be 37.8 °C) and long time cough lasting for about half a month. The cough presented as irritating cough accompanied with nausea, but without phlegm and emesis. It is known that the patient is healthy ordinarily and no obvious inducement was found for these above mentioned symptoms. Therefore, a series of regular examinations were carried out, including laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, CT scanning, and biopsy and pathological diagnosis. The regular laboratory examination was showed in Table 1 . Additionally, plenty of lymphocytes and less mesothelial cells were detected in pleural effusions, without finding heterocyst. For the bronchoscopy, no obstruction was visible within the left principal bronchus and its branches. No hyperaemia, edema and erosion were found in the lumen mucous membrane. No stenosis and neoplasm were visible within the lumen. Mucous membrane was normal in the right upper lobe bronchus while mild hyperemia was found in the mucosa of right lower lobe bronchus, and the corresponding lumen showed with mild distortion and obvious neoplasm development. It was shown with bronchial ridge hypertrophy and enlargement. There was apparent stenosis in the lateral bronchus of the middle-lobe, showing with white moss-like secretions. The bronchial mucosa was a bit brittle and would bleed when touched. For regular CT examination, irregular pulmonary consolidation was presented in the middle and lower lobes around the right hilum, with mean CT value of 44HU; bronchus shadow with narrowed lumen was visible inside the lumen, and swelling lymph node shadow was likely to be visible in the mediastinum; and, a small amount of pleural effusion was presented in the right thorax, while no obvious abnormity was visible in the left one (Fig. 1 ). For the contrast enhanced CT scanning, equally enhancing lesions were presented inside the lung and around pulmonary hilus, with the mean CT value of 98HU during arterial phase (Fig. 2 A), and local stenosis occurred inside the pulmonary artery; by contrast, during the venous phase, the mean CT value was 98 HU (Fig. 2B); multiple lymphadenectasis presented as equal enhancements were found within the right pulmonary hilus and mediastinum (behind the left atrium), while multiple small nodular shadows were visible in the right pleura; and no obvious lymphadenectasis was presented in the left pulmonary hilus.  2.1 Biopsy and pathological examination Biopsy was carried out for the right pleura under thoracoscope, and it was shown that about 500 ml pale yellow effusion was presented in the right thorax, and there were also pleural edema, thickening and adhesion in the right chest. Unequal multiple small nodules with diameters from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm was found on the right side of the pleura, mediastinum, pericardium and pulmonary surface, and lump appeared around the right pulmonary hilus (Fig. 3 ). For further confirmation, the pathological diagnosis was carried out, which showed granulomatous inflammation accompanied with small necrosis, and the possibility of tuberculosis was not excluded. The results of acid fast stain were showed in Fig. 3. Ultrasonic bronchial endoscopy (Ebus) was carried out under general anesthesia, and the lymph node on the punctured right bronchus (region 4R) and subcarinal (region 7) lymph node were sent for biopsy, of which the results showed noncaseating granulomas (Fig. 4 ).

24,S2210261217301931,Ileocaecal and transverse colonic tuberculosis mimicking colonic malignancy – A case report," 2 Case presentation A 46year old female patient came walking to the outpatient department with a 6 month history of diffuse abdominal pain with low grade fever and loss of appetite and weight. No significant past medical or surgical history. There was no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On examination, general condition was fair, vitals were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a soft non tender abdomen with a normal digital per rectal examination. Haematological investigations were normal except erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) which was 80mm (0–30mm normal). Her serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA), cancer antigen19-9(CA 19-9) and serum adenosine deaminase(ADA) levels were within normal limits. Contrast enhanced CT(CECT) abdomen revealed a diffuse concentric long segmental circumferential wall thickening of terminal ileum, ileocaecal(IC) junction and ascending colon with peripheral fat stranding and lymphadenopathy with narrowing at the splenic flexure (Figs. 1–3   ). Colonoscopy showed an ulceronodular lesion with lumen compromise at the splenic flexure and thickening of the ileocaecal junction. Biopsy was taken from both the sites and sent for histopathological examination and also for culture and gene xpert for MTB. Pathology showed moderate mixed inflammation and occasional lymphoid collection in the lamina propria with no evidence of malignancy. There were also occasional crypt abscesses which raised suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. The final diagnosis of tuberculosis of the intestine was made as the biopsy smear showed AFBs and the Gene Xpert detected MTB. The patient was/started on Anti tubercular therapy. At 6 month follow up, patient is asymptomatic. Repeat CT scan shows no narrowing (Fig. 4 ). ",0
25,S1930043318302334,Pelvic tuberculosis: a forgotten diagnosis – case report," Case report An African14-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric disease department for investigation of an adnexal mass. Five months before admission, she immigrated to Portugal from Angola. One month after being in Portugal, she started feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, daily somnolence, and a persistent dry cough. She was medicated with an antihistaminic with some improvement of the cough. As the symptoms persisted, she had some laboratory tests, which showed microcytic hypochromic anemia that was medicated with iron replacement therapy. Two months later, she went to the emergency department due to aggravating symptoms, fever (of irregular pattern), weight loss (4 kg in 1 month), a low abdominal pain, and pain with inspiration in the right hemithorax. There was no associated past medical or surgical history and no history of recent disease in her family circle. She had no other signs or symptoms, namely, no menstrual disturbances (menarcha at 10 years), no urinary, respiratory (the cough subsided), or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination, a palpable painful hypogastric mass was found, hard on palpation and of irregular contours. A BCG vaccination scar was visible. She had an ultrasound (Fig. 1 ) that showed a large pelvic mass (about 12?×?8 cm), centered in the right adnexal area, predominantly cystic, complex, encapsulated, with multiple thin septa and a solid component that exhibited some vascularity in the Color Doppler study (Fig. 1b), creating a mass effect on the uterus and bladder. The left ovary was heterogeneous and mildly enlarged (not shown). There were associated terminal ileum, peritoneal thickening (Fig. 2 ), and mild ascitis. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR; Fig. 3 ) documented a complex cystic mass, apparently having its epicenter on the right adnexal area, with high signal in T2W sequences and intermediate-to-low signal in T1W sequence, with no saturation on fat-suppressed sequences. The multiple septa were thin, irregular, and had no definite enhancement on post gadolinium sequences. A solid enhancing component was not confirmed. Upon scrolling the sagittal images, the lesion suggested to be contiguous with the uterine horn and terminating at the right ovary, hence a hydropyosalpingitis was neither confirmed nor excluded. There was some distortion of ileal loops that were hard to characterize as they were retracted and adherent close together and in apposition with the mass. Despite this, the lesion seemed to be encapsulated and well defined. Some peritoneal enhancement was noted. No adenopathies were visible in the pelvis or in the lomboaortic chains. Chest radiograph (Fig. 4 a) revealed an obliteration of the right costophrenic angle extending upwards along the lateral wall, suggesting a loculated effusion. The corresponding chest ultrasound (Fig. 4b and c) exhibited a pleural effusionat the right lung base, anechogenic, with some thin septa, extending superiorly to the middle lung and causing passive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. Laboratory investigations elicited a normal leucogram and C-reactive protein (CRP), persistence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia (9.1 g/dL) and an elevated CA-125 (576 U/mL, normal values <35 U/mL). As an ovarian malignant tumor was suspected, she was submitted to an exploratory laparotomy with the intent of an eventual resection. A large right adnexal whitish mass was found, occupying the small pelvis, with an uninterrupted capsule, from which adhesions emanated to the bladder and ileon bowel walls, preventing it from resection. There was extensive perilesional inflammatory reaction, adherent to the peritoneal fat and lateral wall of the pelvic region, and multiple lesions with morphology suggestive of implants to the wall of the ileal loops in contact with the mass and in the peritoneum adjacent to the mass. The biopsy of the lesion revealed numerous granulomata with giant cells but no caseous necrosis and no evidence of neoplastic cells. Further laboratory testing revealed an elevated seric ADA (83 U/L, normal ranges being 4.8-23 U/L). As the results of the initial mass sample testing were nonspecific, she was submitted to an ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic lesion and a diagnostic thoracocentesis (also ultrasound guided). The tuberculin skin testing (TST/Mantoux) was marginally positive (13 mm). Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON testing was negative but further testing with IGRA T-SPOT was positive, substantiating the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis. Pleural liquid analysis revealed a very elevated LDH (1083 U/L, 5 times the normal seric value) and elevated ADA (188 U/L, normal being < 45 U/L), with normal leucocyte count. No BK was identified either by PCR or cultural exam. The mass aspirate was PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Almost 1 month later, cultural examination became positive for M. tuberculosis. She started antibacillary therapy with progressive symptomatic and overall improvement. After 8 months on combined antibacillary therapy, ultrasonography (Fig. 5 ) exhibited a residual complex cystic lesion in the right adnexal area, with some distortion of normal ovarian morphology. CA-125 returned to normal values. ",0
26,S193004331830339X,Rare radiological features of abdominopelvic tuberculosis: A case report," Case presentation A 26-year-old woman, para 1 lived 1, was referred to our medical center with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient noted that for the last 3 months she had been gradually experiencing intermittent vaginal bleeding, as well as progressive hypogastric and bilateral lower quadrants abdominal pain. The abdominal pain did not spread to any other spots and did not get relieved or aggravated by any factors. The patient noted that she had no history of any specific diseases. Furthermore, her menstrual cycles had always been regular and previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient also complained of weakness and 5 kg of weight loss (67–62 kg) in the past 3 months. The patient did not report the symptoms of urinary tract infection, coughing and sputum, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, recent travel, and history of any malignancies in her family. Upon examination, the blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg, temperature was 37.8?C, pulse rate was 88 bpm, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. There was a mild tenderness in both the lower quadrants without rebound tenderness. Her abdomen was mildly distended but the shifting dullness examination was negative and there were firm, mobile, and ill-defined edge masses in both lower quadrants. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography showed multicystic adnexal masses; because of the adhesions in the peritoneal cavity, it was impossible to identify peritoneal fluid collection from the cystic enlargement of the ovaries. For further evaluation, the abdominopelvic computed tomography scan was done which demonstrated a multicystic adnexal mass of 2.6?×?2.3 cm with an inaccurate site of origin and diffused nodular peritoneal and omental thickening (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's level of cancer antigen (CA), at 125, was more than the normal range (145 U/mL), but the alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotrophin levels were normal. Her chest X-ray was also normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a microcytic anemia, normal leukocyte count and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80 mm/hr). Laparotomy was performed on the patient due to the mass observed in the ovary and increased serum levels of CA-125 with the presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Lots of adhesions and ovaries covered with granulomatosis lesions were observed. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy were conducted and biopsies from the omentum and peritoneum were taken. Surgery was performed without any complications and no complications occurred postoperatively. Histopathology revealed that fragments of fibroconnective tissue contain numerous well-formed granulomas with extensive caseous necrosis, which was highly indicative of tuberculosis. After that, the result of acid-fast stains confirmed tuberculosis. After the diagnosis of tuberculosis, she underwent antituberculosis treatment.   ",0

She weighed 27 kg for an expected weight of 41 kg. Her pulse was 90/min; respiratory rate was 16/min. There was bilateral pedal edema. Her hemoglobin was 9.4 gm%; total count was 6100/cm2 with 80% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes. Her liver function tests and renal function tests were in normal limits. X-ray chest was performed and showed cardiomegaly. However, there was no calcification noted in the pericardium. A 2D echo showed a thick pericardium about 10 mm, right atrial enlargement, and depressed left ventricular function; Left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] was 40% suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Her condition deteriorated, and she expired on the second day of hospital stay. A complete postmortem was performed. She was an averagely build and poorly nourished female. She had mild pallor and bilateral pedal edema. Examination of chest cavity showed 300-ml pleural effusion on right side. Both the lungs showed 1-mm pinhead sized tubercles on the pleural as well as the cut surface. Heart was enlarged, globular, and weighed 1440 g. Visceral and parietal pericardiums were thickened and opaque, adherent to each other and to the lungs and diaphragm suggestive of pericarditis (Fig. 1 ). On cut section, pericardium was 10-mm thick whitish opaque and firmly adherent to the myocardium. There were multiple diffused white nodular lesions with caseation seen in the pericardium, myocardium reaching up to the endocardium with focal ulceration of the endocardium (Figs. 2 and 3  ). All the chambers of the heart along with the interventricular septum showed involvement by similar lesions. Mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged and matted together; cut surface showed caseation. Spleen and liver also showed multiple miliary tubercles. Brain showed cerebral edema. All the rest of the organs were unremarkable. Histopathological examination of the heart showed extensive areas of caseation with epithelioid cells, Langhan's giant cells, and lymphocytesin in the pericardium, myocardium, and endocardium (Fig. 4 ). Epithelioid cell granulomas with and without caseation were seen in the mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, spleen, and liver. Acid fast bacilli [AFB] stain was done on the section of the heart which was positive for acid-fast bacilli. This case had disseminated tuberculosis with pan cardiac involvement. ",0

He had presented with open mouth and snoring during sleep. Anterior rhinoscopic examination revealed middle turbinate hypertrophy and pale appearance of nasal septum. Diagnostic nasal endoscopic examination showed vegetative mass with smooth surface at the nasopharynx (Fig. 1 ). Rest of the ENT examinations and routine blood investigations were within normal limit. Sputum microscopy and culture were negative for acid fast bacilli whereas bacteriological examination from nasopharyngeal swab showed acid-fast bacilli and the quenching probe PCR test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no evidence of active pulmonary and systemic tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT scan) was done to rule out any mass and its extent at the nasopharynx. CT scan showed large mass occupying the nasopharynx (Fig. 2 ). A bit of tissue was taken from nasopharynx with help of endoscopy under local anesthesia and histopathological examination revealed caseous granulomatous lesion, non-necrotizing granuloma under the ciliated respiratory mucosa. The granulation tissue showed coagulation necrosis and Langerhans type of giant cells at the center (Fig. 3 ). No malignant cells were seen and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Patient was treated with antitubercular therapy (ATT) of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9?months. Patient was clinically improved in third month of treatment and the nasopharyngeal mass was resolved around 4th month months of ATT. ",0

32,S2210261218302311,Rare case of sacrococcygeal tuberculosis mimicking as an anal fistula," 2 Presentation of case A 93-year-old Japanese man who presented with gluteal and coccygeal pain was referred to our hospital. Furthermore, discharging were observed in his fistula in the posterior peri-anal region. He had neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. He had history of pulmonary TB at 25 years of age, and underwent surgery for the removal of complex anal fistula at 75 years of age at another institution. Based on clinical examination, there were two fistulous orifices between the anus and coccyx with purulent discharge (Fig. 1 ). He did not present with cough, fever, weight loss, and anorexia. The chest radiograph result was normal, and hematologic examination showed no abnormalities, except for a slight elevation in C-reactive protein level. Fistulography showed a complex supra-elevator track that is connected to the pre-sacral area and another track ending blindly behind the rectum. The connection between the track and the rectum or anus was not identified on fistulography (Fig. 2 ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole body reveled a lytic destruction of the sacrum (S3-5) and coccyx, with a low-density area in front of the sacrum, suggesting fluid collection (Fig. 3 A). No abnormality was found in the lungs and other vertebrae on CT scan. Colonoscopy findings showed normal colorectal mucosa and no evidence of fistula. Based on these radiological findings and the past medical history of the patient, the recurrence of complex anal fistula with osteomyelitis, or metastatic bone tumor of unknown origin, was suspected. Bacterial examination of the fistula discharge showed normal bacterial culture and was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). However, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using COBAS TaqMan MTB test (Roche Molecular Systems, the USA) was used to test the cold abscess fluid, and results showed that the patient was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AFB test and PCR were negative for sputum. However, the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, the UK) blood test result was positive. Thus, the diagnosis of isolated sacrococcygeal TB was confirmed. The patient was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 7 months. The patient’s pain resolved, and the purulent drainage stopped within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on the physical findings, closure of the fistula was not achieved. However, the PCR test result for PCR DNA turned to be negative. A follow-up CT scan was carried out during treatment, and results showed that fluid collection in front of sacrum had disappeared (Fig. 3B). ",0
33,S120197121830047X,A case-report of a pulmonary tuberculosis with lymphadenopathy mimicking a lymphoma," Case report A 22-year-old Somalian male was referred to the Respiratory Diseases Unit of the university hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, in June 2016. He complained of thoracic pain during his stay in an immigrant reception center, without reporting fever, cough, or any clinically significant comorbidities. The physical examination showed enlarged, not movable, and tender latero-cervical lymph nodes, as well as crackles in the right emi-thorax. Chest X-ray showed a right middle lobe atelectasis and increased bronchovascular markings. Blood examinations showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6g/dl (suspected hypochromic and microcytic anemia), a white blood cell count of 3,930 cells/mm3 (55% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes, 2% eosinophils), and a platelet count of 311,000 cells/mm (Davies et al., 2008). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (6.24mg/dl and 113mm/h, respectively); gamma-globulins on electrophoresis were high but without any monoclonal spikes. His renal and liver function tests were within normal range. Total IgE were 4,820IU/ml. Albumin level was below the normal values (4.00g/dl). A chest CT scan (Figure 1 ) with contrast infusion showed a generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly in the following anatomical sites: latero-cervical (sized ?25–50mm), supraclavicular, subclavian, mediastinal, and sub-diaphragmatic. Para-tracheal, para-cardiac, and right hilar lymph nodes were confluent and enlarged (diameter size: ?30–50mm); furthermore, a right middle lobe collapse, a tree-in bud parenchymal infiltrate, and a right shift of trachea and its bifurcation were found. Spleen showed multiple and rounded lesions. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were smear- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only lymphocytes (CD3+ 90%, CD4+ 68% CD8+ 17%, CD4+/CD8+ 4) were found in the BAL cellular count. A trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the right para-tracheal lymph node was performed; however, the histological pattern was not specific (i.e., non-specific chronic inflammation). Ultrasound scans suggested a lymphoproliferative disorder based on the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, liver enlargement, and small, multiple spleen abscesses. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node. A chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells and central necrosis was found in the histopathological examination. Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott, and Ziehl-Nielsen stained slides did not show any abnormal findings. Immunohistochemistry did not detect tumor cellular markers (i.e., AE1/AE3, CD3, CD20). Based on the clinical features, an empirical anti-TB treatment was started (ethambutol 1.2g/day, isoniazid 300mg/day, rifampicin 600mg/day, pyrazinamide 1.5g/day). However, his clinical conditions rapidly worsened (abdominal pain, vomit, fever, dehydration, elevated liver transaminases levels). One week after TB treatment initiation a left pleural effusion occurred (then, classified as TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). A sample of 2,000ml of pleuritic liquid was collected: it was limpid yellowish, with LDH level of 369U/L, total protein of 4.7g/dl, glucose of 60mg/dl, and PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After 47 days, a BAL culture conversion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurred. The drug susceptibility pattern did not show any drug resistances (i.e., isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Patient was discharged from hospital and underwent a new chest CT scan (Figure 1) after 6 months of treatment. It found an improvement of the atelectasis of the right middle lobe, and a decreased size of the subcarinal, right hilar, and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes. ",0
34,S1201971218345211,The use of bedaquiline to treat patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and end-stage renal disease: A case report," Case reports  Patient 1 In August 2016, a 46-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of pre-extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Two months before that visit, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary and peritoneal TB and had commenced first-line drugs. Subsequent phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) revealed pre-XDR-TB, after which he was transferred to our hospital (Table 1 ). The patient exhibited hypertension and ESRD (anuria requiring conventional hemodialysis three times weekly). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Baseline serum creatinine levels were 8.12mg/dl pre-hemodialysis and 3.97mg/dl post-hemodialysis. The baseline QTcF interval was 441ms on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, amikacin, moxifloxacin, cycloserine, linezolid, and bedaquiline after obtaining informed consent. Bedaquiline was started at 200mg three times weekly and was given for 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse reaction related to bedaquiline was encountered. One year after treatment initiation, amikacin and linezolid were permanently discontinued because of a hearing disturbance and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In April 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 607 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire course of treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 469ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.   Patient 2 In September 2016, a 53-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of MDR-TB. He had taken first-line drugs in 2013 and 2014 to treat drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Three months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB once more and placed on first-line drugs. Subsequent DST revealed MDR-TB, and he was then transferred to our hospital (Table 1). The patient exhibited hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C virus infection, and chronic kidney disease (average urine volume 1500ml/day without a requirement for maintenance renal replacement therapy). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for M. tuberculosis were negative. The baseline serum creatinine level was 3.04mg/dl (the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 21.7ml/min/1.73m2). The baseline QTcF interval was 424ms on ECG monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, amikacin, prothionamide, and cycloserine. Unfortunately, acute kidney injury developed 6 days later (the serum creatinine level increased to 5.1mg/dl, combined with oliguria), and amikacin was thus discontinued permanently. After 2 months, bedaquiline was added to the treatment regimen after obtaining informed consent. (Due to administrative issues, bedaquiline could not be started immediately after discontinuing the amikacin.) Bedaquiline was commenced at 400mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200mg three times weekly. In February 2017 (5 months after treatment commencement and 3 months after the addition of bedaquiline), the patient started conventional maintenance hemodialysis (three times weekly) because renal impairment had progressed. Bedaquiline treatment was continued unchanged for a total of 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse drug reaction related to bedaquiline was observed. Five months after treatment initiation, pyrazinamide was replaced by para-aminosalicylic acid because the patient developed gout. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In June 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 653 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 463ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.  ",0
35,S1413867015002147,Oral manifestation of tuberculosis: a case-report," Case-report A 61-year-old male patient with a history of smoking habit and alcohol abuse was being followed up for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy associated with vasculopathy, systemic hypertension, and chronic pancreatitis in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The patient was referred to the Stomatology Unit of the same hospital due to the emergence of lesions on the oral mucosa. Preliminary examination revealed two lesions, each measuring approximately 10mm across and presenting a granulomatous central portion and whitish halo. The lesions were located on the upper lip mucosa near the median line and on the left jugal mucosa adjacent to the labial anterior commissure (Fig. 1A and B, respectively). The patient complained of pain, productive cough for the past 15 days, night sweats, episodic fever in the morning, and slight weight loss in the previous two months. However, these complaints were intermittently made by the patient along the scheduled appointments, which may have added to the difficulty for an early diagnosis of the disease. Samples of lesions were collected by incision and stained according to the hematoxylin–eosin (HE) and Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocols. The pathological report was negative for the presence of alcohol–acid resistant microorganisms (Fig. 2 ). Due to the comparatively low count of microorganisms in the tissues analyzed, the special staining used did not successfully detect the presence of the bacterium. However, since a negative result in this kind of analysis does not rule out TB, a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage was analyzed according to the Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocol, with a positive result for M. tuberculosis. A radiograph of the thorax was suggestive of presence of active infectious disease, manifested as budding tree-like centrilobular nodules in both lungs, especially on the right. In this case report, the pathological analysis of the samples collected from the patient was not conclusive, requiring a Mantoux assay and the investigation of bronchoalveolar lavage in order to confirm the TB suspicion. The Mantoux protocol indicated a 13-mm inflammatory reaction confirming TB. Anti-HIV test was negative. The patient was referred to a pulmonologist for examination and treatment based on the pulmonary extension of the disease (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, 30 days into the treatment the patient died due to the worsening of clinical conditions, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney failure. ",0
36,S0976566216000412,Horner's syndrome in cervico-dorsal tuberculosis: A rare case report," 2 Case report A 6-year-old male child was brought to our OPD by his parents with chief complaint of weakness of all four limbs for the past 15 days. Weakness was acute in onset and progressively increasing. In addition to this, the patient had pain in upper back and neck with low-grade fever. There was no history of trauma or any other significant complaint. On physical examination, there was deep midline tenderness in cervical and upper dorsal region of spine. Neurologically, there was motor weakness in all four limbs, and sensations and sphincteric functions were intact. The patient was initially managed by absolute bed rest and supportive treatment. Subsequently, when he was evaluated, ESR and CRP both were raised. Radiograph of cervical spine showed straightening with maintained vertebral height and disc spaces. MRI was suggestive of spondylodiscitis along with phlegmonous soft tissue changes in pre- and para-vertebral region of cervico-dorsal spine extending from C3 to D3 vertebra (Figs. 1 and 2  ). Diagnosis of tuberculosis of cervico-dorsal spine was made on the basis of suggestive history, examination, and relevant investigation. One interesting finding we noticed in this patient was association of ptosis and miosis (Fig. 3 ) in left eye with on-going disease process. Enophthalmos and anhidrosis were not seen. Pupillary light reflex was present along with absent ciliospinal reflex. This led to our diagnosis of Horner's syndrome in left eye, which can be a complication of cervico-dorsal tuberculosis. The patient was managed with antitubercular chemotherapy and immobilization of spine using head halter traction. Neurological complications showed some improvement from 3rd week of treatment. At 4th week, traction was released and spine was immobilized on four post collar. At 3 months, there was complete improvement in motor weakness while ocular complication took longer time to recover. At 6 months, the patient showed complete improvement. ATT was continued for one and a half years. ",0

38,S2173579417302062,"Tuberculosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or both? A case report"," Clinic case report Female, 37, who visited due to periocular pain, red eye, edema and erythema of eyelids as well as proptosis in the left eye, with 3 weeks evolution. Previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed at another hospital 4 months earlier on the basis of clinic and compatible imaging confirmed with quantiferon test. The patient had been treated with a quadruple approach comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) during 3 months. At the visit, treatment consisted in rifampicin and isoniazid, which achieved complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. Ophthalmological examination produced a visual acuity of 20/20 in the right eye (RE) and 20/30 in the left eye (LE). The latter was outwardly and forwardly displaced. Hertel exophthalmometry was 12mm in the RE and 21mm in the LE with base in 104. The patient exhibited palpebral edema and erythema, conjunctival chemosis and hyperemia (Fig. 1A). LE ocular motility was moderately limited in all fields of gaze. No intraocular inflammation evidence was found while funduscopy and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. When questioned, the patient denied having other systemic symptoms. After suspecting orbital cellulitis, the patient was hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics without clinic improvement. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), requested upon admission of the patient, revealed a mass in the left orbit compromising the intra-and extra-conal compartments with apparent ethmoidal sinus compromise. The lesion exhibited moderate enhancement with gadolinium (Fig. 1B and C). Taking into account previous TB history, a chest X-ray was taken which showed pleural thickening with increased vascular pattern in the middle lobe of the right lung and inferior cavitations in the left lung (Fig. 2A). Hemogram showed anemia with 10.5g/dl hemoglobin and leukopenia of 3900cells/ml of leukocytes and platelets at 405,000cells/ml. C-reactive protein was positive at 1:160, with increased globular sedimentation velocity of 47mm/h. Creatinine clearing in 24-hour urine was slightly diminished at 51.8ml/min. ELISA test for HIV was negative. Test for hepatitis C, VDRL, FTA-ABS, rheumatoid factor and serum PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were likewise negative. Orbit biopsy was performed through anterior orbitotomy, which evidenced fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels with inflammatory infiltrates comprising lymphocytes, neutrophiles and some eosinophiles (Fig. 2B and C). With these findings, ANCA PR3 (c-ANCA) and MPO (p-ANCA) were analyzed, finding elevated levels of PR3 (c-ANCA) up to 59U/ml. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with GP. Treatment consisted in oral prednisone and 100mg/day cyclophosphamide during 10 months. Thereafter, treatment was switched to methotrexate which produced complete and sustained resolution of the orbit inflammation (Fig. 3A). Hertel exopthalmometry diminished to 17mm in the LE although ocular motility of this eye persisted with a limitation of ?1 for elevation and adduction, without subjective diplopia. Post-treatment orbital computerized tomography (CT) showed diminished mass in the orbit and proptosis. It also evidenced left rhinosinus disease (Fig. 3B and C). After 3 years of sustained remission, medical treatment was suspended. A few weeks later, the patient began to exhibit left diffuse anterior scleritis that resolved completely after medical treatment. Following this episode, immunosuppressant treatment was resumed. With a follow-up of 3 years, the patient remains stable and without vasculitis relapse in treatment with azathioprine and low dose of prednisone. ",0
39,S2211753916300598,Chronic Paracoccidioidomycosis with adrenal involvement mimicking tuberculosis – A case report from Austria," 2 Case A 62-year-old man was transferred from a community hospital to our department due to suspected diagnosis of reactivated tuberculosis of the lungs and adrenal glands in February 2015 (day 0). He reported left-sided chest and abdominal pain, weight loss of 12kg during the last 3 weeks as well as night sweats and cough. The punctum maximum of the abdominal pain was located at the left costal margin and aggravated at inspiration. Past medical history revealed several episodes of tuberculosis with involvement of the lungs, testes and adrenal glands ( Fig. 1). The patient reported that tuberculosis was diagnosed for the first time at the age of 7 years, followed by reactivations in the lungs with dissemination to the testes at the age of 14 and 21. Therefore, the patient had received tuberculostatic therapy, repeatedly. In 2010, he underwent CT-guided biopsy of a suspicious pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe and left adrenal gland due to considerable enlargement of adrenal glands. Based on the histopathological finding of epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis, the diagnosis of tuberculosis of lungs and adrenal glands was made. At that time, sputum smear, PCR and culture for acid fast bacilli were negative. Due to increasing size of the adrenal glands the patient underwent a second biopsy in the same hospital in 2012. Histopathological finding were similar to previous biopsy and again considered to be tuberculosis. From the year 1997 until 2001 he made yearly visits – each for several weeks - to a village in Regio de Pasco (Peru), a rural area located next to the rainforest of the Amazonas. He lived there in a house with a garden for approximately three years (2002–2004) and helped to construct a hospital. He did no agricultural or field work. During his stay in Peru he had no injury or disease worth mentioning. Except for two days in Arica (Chile) he did not visit any other South or Central American regions or countries. In addition, he reported that one day he recognized bats in the ceiling of his house and inhaled their excrements during cleaning. In addition to tuberculosis our patient had a past medical history of chronic bronchitis, Billroth II surgery due to peptic ulcer disease, cholecystectomy and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy approximately 10 years ago. The patient was a retired patient transport service driver in an Austrian hospital. Family history revealed a tuberculosis infection of his father. He was a current smoker with a history of 45 pack years, reported occasional alcohol consumption and no known allergies. He was on no chronic medication. Upon admission, the patient appeared in a good general condition with normal body temperature and a blood pressure of 120/70mmHg. Auscultation and percussion of lungs and heart were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft and showed periumbilical tenderness without resistance. Peripheral edema was not observed. Basic neurological examination and skin were unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with 78 beats per minute and no pathological findings. There was a mild eosinophilia (6%) and monocytosis (16%), but total white cell count (8.1G/l), hemoglobin (13.9g/dl), and platelet count (366G/l) were within normal limits. Levels of serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were normal. The concentration of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT, 193U/l), alkaline phosphatase (224U/l), and C-reactive protein (9.0mg/dl), plasma fibrinogen (560mg/dl), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 54/81mm) were elevated. Serum albumin (3.4g/dl) and sodium (135mmol/l) were slightly decreased while other electrolytes were normal. Myocardial biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin-T (hs-TnT), creatine kinase (CK) and muscle-brain type creatine kinase (CK-MB) were within normal range. Computed tomography (CT) showed postspecific pulmonary lesions. Compared to previous examinations, abdominal CT (day +0) revealed an increasing inhomogeneous enlargement of the adrenal glands (4.0×6.3cm) ( Fig. 2). Additionally, several enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenterial lymph nodes were found. Subsequently performed positron emission tomography (PET) (day +18) revealed an increased metabolic activity in bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands. Furthermore, hypermetabolic activity of cervical lymph nodes and the laryngeal area was found. Clinical and radiographic findings were suspicious for reactivation of tuberculosis. Interferon-gamma release assay (Quantiferon) (day +7) was positive but Ziehl-Neelsen smear, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of the sputum were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lues and adrenal autoantibodies were negative. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms such as tremor, disturbance of sensitivity and weakness of the extremities, triggered a neurological work-up. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (day +31) revealed a round temporo-parietal located lesion with perifocal edema, suspicious for infection or metastasis ( Fig. 3). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture (day +34) was unremarkable without any sign for infection, inflammation or neoplasm. Neurosurgeons did not consider surgical intervention. The cause of hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal enlargement remained unclear, initially. Tuberculosis was suspected but could not be confirmed by microbiology. Hence, CT guided biopsy of the left adrenal gland and extirpation of a right cervical lymph node (day +42) were performed for histopathological and microbiological work-up. Neither in the biopsy specimens of left adrenal gland nor the right cervical lymph node, Ziehl-Neelsen and PCR revealed any evidence for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (day +45). Serology for various systemic fungal infections and broad spectrum PCR from blood and aspirate fluids from biopsy (day +49) were negative as well. Histology of lymph node and left adrenal gland biopsy showed granulomas with central necrosis (day +48). In addition, in the left adrenal gland periodic acid–schiff (PAS), McManus, and methenamine silver stain (Grocott) revealed evidence of fungal pathogens. Giemsa stain of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen (day +49) showed characteristic yeast elements with multipolar budding of variable size thus indicating the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Fig. 4). Cultures of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen, were positive after incubation for 5 days (day +54) at 37°C and 28°C on Columbia agar (with 5% sheep blood; bioMérieux, Austria), 2% Sabouraud dextrose agar (Oxoid, Austria) and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI agar, Merck, Austria). Sequence analysis of the isolate confirmed the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sequence similarity was assessed by a search of homology not only with GenBank sequences, but also with the ISHAM ITS database. 100% identity was achieved with both databases (ISHAM identification number: MITS2102). Thus, we diagnosed paracoccidioidomycosis with dissemination to adrenal glands and highly suspicious involvement of cervical lymph nodes and the brain. When paracoccidioidomycosis was suspected, the specimen and all cultures were processed in a special laboratory for biosafety level 3 (S3-laboratory). This laboratory has all the equipment and safety features required for biosafety level 3 with controlled air flow and filtered ventilation systems. All personnel wore personal protective equipment (specialized clothing, gloves whenever handling the specimens or cultures). In accordance to this, personnel had the utmost protection against accidental infection. After identification of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antifungal treatment was initiated ( Table 1). In addition, replacement therapy with fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone was prescribed. Due to the evidence of cerebral involvement the patient was initially treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. The patient's general clinical condition improved and the antifungal therapy was switched to oral itraconazole. However, itraconazole never reached therapeutic level - neither with capsule nor liquid formulation, most probably due to the previous Billroth II resection. After deterioration of the patient and an increase in inflammatory parameters, liposomal amphotericin B was restarted. Associated with worsening of the systemic inflammation, hypotension, prerenal kidney failure and subsequent Addison crises occurred, so that hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone doses had to be adapted and high volume intravenous (IV) fluids substituted. Several ultrasound imaging studies showed a continuous decrease in size of the bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and a follow-up MRI of the brain revealed a shrinking size of the cerebral lesion. Overall clinical improvement was observed. After consultation of an infectious disease specialist, our patient was switched to oral posaconazole. Finally, the patient was discharged in a good general condition on oral posaconazole. ",0
40,S120197121834431X,First case of sexually transmitted asymptomatic female genital tuberculosis from spousal epididymal tuberculosis diagnosed by active screening," Case reports  Patient 1 (index case) A 54-year-old man noticed a swelling of the right epididymis approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. He was initially considered to have acute epididymitis. Although the causative organism could not be identified by urine testing, he was prescribed oral levofloxacin. The swelling of the epididymis recurred several times and was relieved by levofloxacin each time. However, approximately 1.5 years before the diagnosis, the left epididymis also started to swell gradually. A left orchiectomy was performed, because a tumor of the epididymis was suspected. Pathological findings of the resected testis revealed multinucleated giant cells and numerous caseous granulomas. He was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases because tuberculosis was highly suspected. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with epididymal tuberculosis based on urine PCR, urine culture, and histopathological findings. Additionally, a T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and HIV antibody test were both negative. Findings on chest computed tomography (CT) scan were unremarkable except for calcification of a mediastinal lymph node. He had been diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years earlier, which had been resected; there had been no recurrence at the time of presentation. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated was susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, levofloxacin, and streptomycin. Treatment was commenced with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a further 4 months.   Patient 2 (infected spouse) A 53-year-old woman visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Toranomon Hospital with her husband (patient 1) to inquire about the possibility of sexual transmission of tuberculosis approximately 1 month after his diagnosis. They were worried, although she looked healthy and had no symptoms: no fever, night sweats, weight loss, pelvic or abdominal pain, menstrual disorder, or respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and cough. She had been having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband once a week until 6 months before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. However, she had then refrained from sexual intercourse with her husband when they noticed the apparent swelling of his left epididymis because she was afraid of contracting a sexually transmitted infection from him. She had no past history of illnesses or operations, except for migraine at about 20 years of age and bilateral tubal ligation at about 35 years of age after the delivery of their third child. She reported having no other sexual partners after marriage. Finally, it was decided to perform active screening for genital tuberculosis even though she was asymptomatic. Laboratory findings of blood and urine testing were unremarkable. A T-SPOT.TB test and HIV antibody test were both negative. Chest and abdominal CT scans that included the pelvic area were unremarkable. Furthermore, a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound performed by a gynecologist were unremarkable except for a right ovarian cyst. A biopsy was not performed because no abnormal findings were observed in the endocervical canal or endometrium at that time. However, vaginal swab culture yielded M. tuberculosis and she was diagnosed with genital tuberculosis. Treatment for tuberculosis was started with the same regimen as that of her husband. Both M. tuberculosis isolates were sent to the Research Institute of Tuberculosis (Tokyo, Japan) for further analysis. Variable number tandem repeat analysis (VNTR, 24 loci) showed that the organisms from the two cases were identical (Iwamoto et al., 2012). Further analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS; MiSeq, Illumina) confirmed that the two isolates were genetically identical with only one nucleotide difference (Sekizuka et al., 2015).  ",0
42,S2214442014000941,Tuberculosis of the Spermatic Cord: Case Report," Case presentation A 44-year-old patient with no medical history of personal or family tuberculosis showed a 4-cm painful swelling on the right testicle, which had appeared 3 months earlier. The patient had not lost weight and showed no sign of infection. Testicle ultrasonography revealed an isoechoic, cylindrical, paratesticular structure, measuring 4 cm in its largest diameter. Routine blood and urine tests were within normal values with no inflammatory signs. Alpha Foetoprotein and beta Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin were normal. No tuberculosis skin test was performed. A surgery was performed, revealing an indurated right spermatic cord caught in a fibrous magma extending from the tail of the epididymis to the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 1 ). The fibrous cord was dissected and isolated from all the elements of the spermatic cord, with preservation of the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels. The testes were reinstated in purse. Histology showed on a 4 × 2 × 1 cm specimen, an epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomatous process with foci of caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). A checkup was made afterward revealing no other tuberculous location. The patient was given a 6-month antituberculous treatment: 2 (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol) + 4 (rifampicin + isoniazid) with a satisfying uneventful evolution. ",0
43,S1054880716300102,“Death at the wheel” due to tuberculosis of the myocardium: a case report," 2 Case report The body of a 35-year-old adult African male was admitted to our medicolegal mortuary, the deceased having been the driver of a motor vehicle that had apparently inexplicably veered off the road and collided with a tree at relatively low speed. No specific history of prior cardiac problems or other underlying medical conditions could be established. At autopsy, the deceased was well-nourished, measuring 1.8m in length and with a body mass of 108kg. There were no external injuries. Internal examination revealed a grossly enlarged heart with a mass of 540g, but with only modestly increased epicardial fat deposits. Further dissection revealed extensive, partially confluent yellow to white nodular infiltrates involving the walls of all cardiac chambers. The nodules varied from 5 to 15mm in diameter and had a firm, rubbery consistency (Fig. 1 ). Macroscopically, the lungs and kidneys showed no overt signs of disease, but sectioning of the spleen revealed multiple small white parenchymal nodules measuring 1–2mm in diameter, in keeping with miliary TB. Histological examination of the heart showed well-formed granulomas that were present in the full thickness of the myocardium on some of the sections. These granulomas consisted of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes and Langhans type as well as multinucleated giant cells with central areas of caseous necrosis. No eosinophils, Aschoff cells or asteroid bodies noted (Fig. 2 ). Histological examination of the kidneys showed no abnormalities with no granulomas present but histology of the lungs and spleen revealed a similar granulomatous inflammatory process as seen in the heart. The histological examination of the lung and spleen is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4  . However, multiple attempts at demonstrating acid-fast bacilli from several sites of the myocardium by using the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain were unsuccessful (Fig. 5 ). The PAS stain on the myocardial tissue was negative (Fig. 6 ). ZN staining of the lungs and spleen was also negative. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was further performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue but again a negative result ensued. Despite the negative outcome of the special investigations and based primarily on the macroscopic and histological findings, a final diagnosis of TB with involvement of the myocardium was made. ",0

47,S221255311600008X,Chronic oozing skin lesions in children: Possible tuberculosis? Two case reports," Case 2 A 5-year-old female presented with multiple swellings and discharging sinuses (oozing thick, whitish fluid) over the skin of the left upper part of the neck and submandibular area. The surrounding skin was purple-blue in color with elevated edges. Six months later, the patient developed two upper-left cervical swellings and one submandibular swelling that was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics with no response. These swellings began to open by fistula to the outer skin, oozing thick white fluid (Fig. 4 ). The patient had no history of chest disease and no chest symptoms, and no contact history with a TB-related case. Routine biochemical analysis, complete blood count, and urine analysis were all normal. ESR was 70 for the 1st hour, and the chest radiograph was normal. The tuberculin test was positive (induration 22mm×24mm), and a quantiferon TB gold test was positive. Gastric lavage was negative for mycobacteria. Swabs from the discharging fluid were sent for pyogenic culture and culture for acid-fast bacilli. A neck ultrasound revealed multiple bilateral-cervical, left-supraclavicular, and left-axillary lymph nodes (LNs) ranging from 1.4cm to 1.7cm. Some of the cervical and supraclavicular LNs were forming cystic turbid abscesses from 0.7cm to 2.3cm in size. Skin and LN biopsy was done, with the skin showing dense dermal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells and minimal epithelioid granulomata and sinus-tract formation. The LN architecture was mostly replaced with caseating epithelioid granuloma with few multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 5 ). Both patients received Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. A scar is now present at the site of injection. The patient had no history of previous pulmonary TB since birth, and developmental and family histories were unremarkable, with no family members having a history of TB. ",0

The cough presented as irritating cough accompanied with nausea, but without phlegm and emesis. It is known that the patient is healthy ordinarily and no obvious inducement was found for these above mentioned symptoms. Therefore, a series of regular examinations were carried out, including laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, CT scanning, and biopsy and pathological diagnosis. The regular laboratory examination was showed in Table 1 . Additionally, plenty of lymphocytes and less mesothelial cells were detected in pleural effusions, without finding heterocyst. For the bronchoscopy, no obstruction was visible within the left principal bronchus and its branches. No hyperaemia, edema and erosion were found in the lumen mucous membrane. No stenosis and neoplasm were visible within the lumen. Mucous membrane was normal in the right upper lobe bronchus while mild hyperemia was found in the mucosa of right lower lobe bronchus, and the corresponding lumen showed with mild distortion and obvious neoplasm development. It was shown with bronchial ridge hypertrophy and enlargement. There was apparent stenosis in the lateral bronchus of the middle-lobe, showing with white moss-like secretions. The bronchial mucosa was a bit brittle and would bleed when touched. For regular CT examination, irregular pulmonary consolidation was presented in the middle and lower lobes around the right hilum, with mean CT value of 44HU; bronchus shadow with narrowed lumen was visible inside the lumen, and swelling lymph node shadow was likely to be visible in the mediastinum; and, a small amount of pleural effusion was presented in the right thorax, while no obvious abnormity was visible in the left one (Fig. 1 ). For the contrast enhanced CT scanning, equally enhancing lesions were presented inside the lung and around pulmonary hilus, with the mean CT value of 98HU during arterial phase (Fig. 2 A), and local stenosis occurred inside the pulmonary artery; by contrast, during the venous phase, the mean CT value was 98 HU (Fig. 2B); multiple lymphadenectasis presented as equal enhancements were found within the right pulmonary hilus and mediastinum (behind the left atrium), while multiple small nodular shadows were visible in the right pleura; and no obvious lymphadenectasis was presented in the left pulmonary hilus.  2.1 Biopsy and pathological examination Biopsy was carried out for the right pleura under thoracoscope, and it was shown that about 500 ml pale yellow effusion was presented in the right thorax, and there were also pleural edema, thickening and adhesion in the right chest. Unequal multiple small nodules with diameters from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm was found on the right side of the pleura, mediastinum, pericardium and pulmonary surface, and lump appeared around the right pulmonary hilus (Fig. 3 ). For further confirmation, the pathological diagnosis was carried out, which showed granulomatous inflammation accompanied with small necrosis, and the possibility of tuberculosis was not excluded. The results of acid fast stain were showed in Fig. 3. Ultrasonic bronchial endoscopy (Ebus) was carried out under general anesthesia, and the lymph node on the punctured right bronchus (region 4R) and subcarinal (region 7) lymph node were sent for biopsy, of which the results showed noncaseating granulomas (Fig. 4 ).

49,S2210261217301931,Ileocaecal and transverse colonic tuberculosis mimicking colonic malignancy – A case report," 2 Case presentation A 46year old female patient came walking to the outpatient department with a 6 month history of diffuse abdominal pain with low grade fever and loss of appetite and weight. No significant past medical or surgical history. There was no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On examination, general condition was fair, vitals were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a soft non tender abdomen with a normal digital per rectal examination. Haematological investigations were normal except erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) which was 80mm (0–30mm normal). Her serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA), cancer antigen19-9(CA 19-9) and serum adenosine deaminase(ADA) levels were within normal limits. Contrast enhanced CT(CECT) abdomen revealed a diffuse concentric long segmental circumferential wall thickening of terminal ileum, ileocaecal(IC) junction and ascending colon with peripheral fat stranding and lymphadenopathy with narrowing at the splenic flexure (Figs. 1–3   ). Colonoscopy showed an ulceronodular lesion with lumen compromise at the splenic flexure and thickening of the ileocaecal junction. Biopsy was taken from both the sites and sent for histopathological examination and also for culture and gene xpert for MTB. Pathology showed moderate mixed inflammation and occasional lymphoid collection in the lamina propria with no evidence of malignancy. There were also occasional crypt abscesses which raised suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. The final diagnosis of tuberculosis of the intestine was made as the biopsy smear showed AFBs and the Gene Xpert detected MTB. The patient was/started on Anti tubercular therapy. At 6 month follow up, patient is asymptomatic. Repeat CT scan shows no narrowing (Fig. 4 ). ",0
50,S1930043318302334,Pelvic tuberculosis: a forgotten diagnosis – case report," Case report An African14-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric disease department for investigation of an adnexal mass. Five months before admission, she immigrated to Portugal from Angola. One month after being in Portugal, she started feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, daily somnolence, and a persistent dry cough. She was medicated with an antihistaminic with some improvement of the cough. As the symptoms persisted, she had some laboratory tests, which showed microcytic hypochromic anemia that was medicated with iron replacement therapy. Two months later, she went to the emergency department due to aggravating symptoms, fever (of irregular pattern), weight loss (4 kg in 1 month), a low abdominal pain, and pain with inspiration in the right hemithorax. There was no associated past medical or surgical history and no history of recent disease in her family circle. She had no other signs or symptoms, namely, no menstrual disturbances (menarcha at 10 years), no urinary, respiratory (the cough subsided), or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination, a palpable painful hypogastric mass was found, hard on palpation and of irregular contours. A BCG vaccination scar was visible. She had an ultrasound (Fig. 1 ) that showed a large pelvic mass (about 12?×?8 cm), centered in the right adnexal area, predominantly cystic, complex, encapsulated, with multiple thin septa and a solid component that exhibited some vascularity in the Color Doppler study (Fig. 1b), creating a mass effect on the uterus and bladder. The left ovary was heterogeneous and mildly enlarged (not shown). There were associated terminal ileum, peritoneal thickening (Fig. 2 ), and mild ascitis. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR; Fig. 3 ) documented a complex cystic mass, apparently having its epicenter on the right adnexal area, with high signal in T2W sequences and intermediate-to-low signal in T1W sequence, with no saturation on fat-suppressed sequences. The multiple septa were thin, irregular, and had no definite enhancement on post gadolinium sequences. A solid enhancing component was not confirmed. Upon scrolling the sagittal images, the lesion suggested to be contiguous with the uterine horn and terminating at the right ovary, hence a hydropyosalpingitis was neither confirmed nor excluded. There was some distortion of ileal loops that were hard to characterize as they were retracted and adherent close together and in apposition with the mass. Despite this, the lesion seemed to be encapsulated and well defined. Some peritoneal enhancement was noted. No adenopathies were visible in the pelvis or in the lomboaortic chains. Chest radiograph (Fig. 4 a) revealed an obliteration of the right costophrenic angle extending upwards along the lateral wall, suggesting a loculated effusion. The corresponding chest ultrasound (Fig. 4b and c) exhibited a pleural effusionat the right lung base, anechogenic, with some thin septa, extending superiorly to the middle lung and causing passive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. Laboratory investigations elicited a normal leucogram and C-reactive protein (CRP), persistence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia (9.1 g/dL) and an elevated CA-125 (576 U/mL, normal values <35 U/mL). As an ovarian malignant tumor was suspected, she was submitted to an exploratory laparotomy with the intent of an eventual resection. A large right adnexal whitish mass was found, occupying the small pelvis, with an uninterrupted capsule, from which adhesions emanated to the bladder and ileon bowel walls, preventing it from resection. There was extensive perilesional inflammatory reaction, adherent to the peritoneal fat and lateral wall of the pelvic region, and multiple lesions with morphology suggestive of implants to the wall of the ileal loops in contact with the mass and in the peritoneum adjacent to the mass. The biopsy of the lesion revealed numerous granulomata with giant cells but no caseous necrosis and no evidence of neoplastic cells. Further laboratory testing revealed an elevated seric ADA (83 U/L, normal ranges being 4.8-23 U/L). As the results of the initial mass sample testing were nonspecific, she was submitted to an ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic lesion and a diagnostic thoracocentesis (also ultrasound guided). The tuberculin skin testing (TST/Mantoux) was marginally positive (13 mm). Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON testing was negative but further testing with IGRA T-SPOT was positive, substantiating the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis. Pleural liquid analysis revealed a very elevated LDH (1083 U/L, 5 times the normal seric value) and elevated ADA (188 U/L, normal being < 45 U/L), with normal leucocyte count. No BK was identified either by PCR or cultural exam. The mass aspirate was PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Almost 1 month later, cultural examination became positive for M. tuberculosis. She started antibacillary therapy with progressive symptomatic and overall improvement. After 8 months on combined antibacillary therapy, ultrasonography (Fig. 5 ) exhibited a residual complex cystic lesion in the right adnexal area, with some distortion of normal ovarian morphology. CA-125 returned to normal values. ",0
51,S193004331830339X,Rare radiological features of abdominopelvic tuberculosis: A case report," Case presentation A 26-year-old woman, para 1 lived 1, was referred to our medical center with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient noted that for the last 3 months she had been gradually experiencing intermittent vaginal bleeding, as well as progressive hypogastric and bilateral lower quadrants abdominal pain. The abdominal pain did not spread to any other spots and did not get relieved or aggravated by any factors. The patient noted that she had no history of any specific diseases. Furthermore, her menstrual cycles had always been regular and previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient also complained of weakness and 5 kg of weight loss (67–62 kg) in the past 3 months. The patient did not report the symptoms of urinary tract infection, coughing and sputum, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, recent travel, and history of any malignancies in her family. Upon examination, the blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg, temperature was 37.8?C, pulse rate was 88 bpm, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. There was a mild tenderness in both the lower quadrants without rebound tenderness. Her abdomen was mildly distended but the shifting dullness examination was negative and there were firm, mobile, and ill-defined edge masses in both lower quadrants. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography showed multicystic adnexal masses; because of the adhesions in the peritoneal cavity, it was impossible to identify peritoneal fluid collection from the cystic enlargement of the ovaries. For further evaluation, the abdominopelvic computed tomography scan was done which demonstrated a multicystic adnexal mass of 2.6?×?2.3 cm with an inaccurate site of origin and diffused nodular peritoneal and omental thickening (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's level of cancer antigen (CA), at 125, was more than the normal range (145 U/mL), but the alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotrophin levels were normal. Her chest X-ray was also normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a microcytic anemia, normal leukocyte count and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80 mm/hr). Laparotomy was performed on the patient due to the mass observed in the ovary and increased serum levels of CA-125 with the presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Lots of adhesions and ovaries covered with granulomatosis lesions were observed. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy were conducted and biopsies from the omentum and peritoneum were taken. Surgery was performed without any complications and no complications occurred postoperatively. Histopathology revealed that fragments of fibroconnective tissue contain numerous well-formed granulomas with extensive caseous necrosis, which was highly indicative of tuberculosis. After that, the result of acid-fast stains confirmed tuberculosis. After the diagnosis of tuberculosis, she underwent antituberculosis treatment.   ",0
53,S1054880715001210,Pancardiac tuberculosis — a case report," 2 Case history A 14-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with complaints of progressive dyspnea, chest pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss since 1 year. She weighed 27 kg for an expected weight of 41 kg. Her pulse was 90/min; respiratory rate was 16/min. There was bilateral pedal edema. Her hemoglobin was 9.4 gm%; total count was 6100/cm2 with 80% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes. Her liver function tests and renal function tests were in normal limits. X-ray chest was performed and showed cardiomegaly. However, there was no calcification noted in the pericardium. A 2D echo showed a thick pericardium about 10 mm, right atrial enlargement, and depressed left ventricular function; Left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] was 40% suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Her condition deteriorated, and she expired on the second day of hospital stay. A complete postmortem was performed. She was an averagely build and poorly nourished female. She had mild pallor and bilateral pedal edema. Examination of chest cavity showed 300-ml pleural effusion on right side. Both the lungs showed 1-mm pinhead sized tubercles on the pleural as well as the cut surface. Heart was enlarged, globular, and weighed 1440 g. Visceral and parietal pericardiums were thickened and opaque, adherent to each other and to the lungs and diaphragm suggestive of pericarditis (Fig. 1 ). On cut section, pericardium was 10-mm thick whitish opaque and firmly adherent to the myocardium. There were multiple diffused white nodular lesions with caseation seen in the pericardium, myocardium reaching up to the endocardium with focal ulceration of the endocardium (Figs. 2 and 3  ). All the chambers of the heart along with the interventricular septum showed involvement by similar lesions. Mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged and matted together; cut surface showed caseation. Spleen and liver also showed multiple miliary tubercles. Brain showed cerebral edema. All the rest of the organs were unremarkable. Histopathological examination of the heart showed extensive areas of caseation with epithelioid cells, Langhan's giant cells, and lymphocytesin in the pericardium, myocardium, and endocardium (Fig. 4 ). Epithelioid cell granulomas with and without caseation were seen in the mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, spleen, and liver. Acid fast bacilli [AFB] stain was done on the section of the heart which was positive for acid-fast bacilli. This case had disseminated tuberculosis with pan cardiac involvement. ",0
54,S1110663818300041,Isolated nasopharyngeal tuberculosis in a 12?year old boy – A case report," Case report A 12?year old boy presented with nasal obstruction since 8?months. He had presented with open mouth and snoring during sleep. Anterior rhinoscopic examination revealed middle turbinate hypertrophy and pale appearance of nasal septum. Diagnostic nasal endoscopic examination showed vegetative mass with smooth surface at the nasopharynx (Fig. 1 ). Rest of the ENT examinations and routine blood investigations were within normal limit. Sputum microscopy and culture were negative for acid fast bacilli whereas bacteriological examination from nasopharyngeal swab showed acid-fast bacilli and the quenching probe PCR test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no evidence of active pulmonary and systemic tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT scan) was done to rule out any mass and its extent at the nasopharynx. CT scan showed large mass occupying the nasopharynx (Fig. 2 ). A bit of tissue was taken from nasopharynx with help of endoscopy under local anesthesia and histopathological examination revealed caseous granulomatous lesion, non-necrotizing granuloma under the ciliated respiratory mucosa. The granulation tissue showed coagulation necrosis and Langerhans type of giant cells at the center (Fig. 3 ). No malignant cells were seen and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Patient was treated with antitubercular therapy (ATT) of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9?months. Patient was clinically improved in third month of treatment and the nasopharyngeal mass was resolved around 4th month months of ATT. ",0
55,S2214442018300810,A case report: Addison disease caused by adrenal tuberculosis," Case report A 43-year-old man was admitted for the evaluation of Addison's disease. He complain of depression, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, joint pain, skin hyper-pigmentation, nails, mouth and mucous membranes of the lips. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal and neurologic examination showed no abnormalities. Laboratory serum cortisol <0.05 ?gr/dl (Normal range: 3.09–16.6 ?g/dL). Investigation of the causes of this adrenal hipofunction due to tuberculosis by blood sedimentation rate, Mantoux test show negative results. Following to Interferon Gamma Release Assay, IGRA test also show negative results. Upper abdominal MRI shows bilateral adrenal (right AP 5.59 × LL 5.56 × CC 4.46 cm; left AP 4.74 × LL 4.12 × CC 5.66 cm) with regular edges, bilateral adrenal hypertrophy suspects with differential diagnosis of adrenal adenomas (see Fig. 1 ).

57,S2210261218302311,Rare case of sacrococcygeal tuberculosis mimicking as an anal fistula," 2 Presentation of case A 93-year-old Japanese man who presented with gluteal and coccygeal pain was referred to our hospital. Furthermore, discharging were observed in his fistula in the posterior peri-anal region. He had neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. He had history of pulmonary TB at 25 years of age, and underwent surgery for the removal of complex anal fistula at 75 years of age at another institution. Based on clinical examination, there were two fistulous orifices between the anus and coccyx with purulent discharge (Fig. 1 ). He did not present with cough, fever, weight loss, and anorexia. The chest radiograph result was normal, and hematologic examination showed no abnormalities, except for a slight elevation in C-reactive protein level. Fistulography showed a complex supra-elevator track that is connected to the pre-sacral area and another track ending blindly behind the rectum. The connection between the track and the rectum or anus was not identified on fistulography (Fig. 2 ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole body reveled a lytic destruction of the sacrum (S3-5) and coccyx, with a low-density area in front of the sacrum, suggesting fluid collection (Fig. 3 A). No abnormality was found in the lungs and other vertebrae on CT scan. Colonoscopy findings showed normal colorectal mucosa and no evidence of fistula. Based on these radiological findings and the past medical history of the patient, the recurrence of complex anal fistula with osteomyelitis, or metastatic bone tumor of unknown origin, was suspected. Bacterial examination of the fistula discharge showed normal bacterial culture and was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). However, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using COBAS TaqMan MTB test (Roche Molecular Systems, the USA) was used to test the cold abscess fluid, and results showed that the patient was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AFB test and PCR were negative for sputum. However, the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, the UK) blood test result was positive. Thus, the diagnosis of isolated sacrococcygeal TB was confirmed. The patient was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 7 months. The patient’s pain resolved, and the purulent drainage stopped within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on the physical findings, closure of the fistula was not achieved. However, the PCR test result for PCR DNA turned to be negative. A follow-up CT scan was carried out during treatment, and results showed that fluid collection in front of sacrum had disappeared (Fig. 3B). ",0
58,S120197121830047X,A case-report of a pulmonary tuberculosis with lymphadenopathy mimicking a lymphoma," Case report A 22-year-old Somalian male was referred to the Respiratory Diseases Unit of the university hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, in June 2016. He complained of thoracic pain during his stay in an immigrant reception center, without reporting fever, cough, or any clinically significant comorbidities. The physical examination showed enlarged, not movable, and tender latero-cervical lymph nodes, as well as crackles in the right emi-thorax. Chest X-ray showed a right middle lobe atelectasis and increased bronchovascular markings. Blood examinations showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6g/dl (suspected hypochromic and microcytic anemia), a white blood cell count of 3,930 cells/mm3 (55% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes, 2% eosinophils), and a platelet count of 311,000 cells/mm (Davies et al., 2008). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (6.24mg/dl and 113mm/h, respectively); gamma-globulins on electrophoresis were high but without any monoclonal spikes. His renal and liver function tests were within normal range. Total IgE were 4,820IU/ml. Albumin level was below the normal values (4.00g/dl). A chest CT scan (Figure 1 ) with contrast infusion showed a generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly in the following anatomical sites: latero-cervical (sized ?25–50mm), supraclavicular, subclavian, mediastinal, and sub-diaphragmatic. Para-tracheal, para-cardiac, and right hilar lymph nodes were confluent and enlarged (diameter size: ?30–50mm); furthermore, a right middle lobe collapse, a tree-in bud parenchymal infiltrate, and a right shift of trachea and its bifurcation were found. Spleen showed multiple and rounded lesions. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were smear- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only lymphocytes (CD3+ 90%, CD4+ 68% CD8+ 17%, CD4+/CD8+ 4) were found in the BAL cellular count. A trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the right para-tracheal lymph node was performed; however, the histological pattern was not specific (i.e., non-specific chronic inflammation). Ultrasound scans suggested a lymphoproliferative disorder based on the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, liver enlargement, and small, multiple spleen abscesses. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node. A chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells and central necrosis was found in the histopathological examination. Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott, and Ziehl-Nielsen stained slides did not show any abnormal findings. Immunohistochemistry did not detect tumor cellular markers (i.e., AE1/AE3, CD3, CD20). Based on the clinical features, an empirical anti-TB treatment was started (ethambutol 1.2g/day, isoniazid 300mg/day, rifampicin 600mg/day, pyrazinamide 1.5g/day). However, his clinical conditions rapidly worsened (abdominal pain, vomit, fever, dehydration, elevated liver transaminases levels). One week after TB treatment initiation a left pleural effusion occurred (then, classified as TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). A sample of 2,000ml of pleuritic liquid was collected: it was limpid yellowish, with LDH level of 369U/L, total protein of 4.7g/dl, glucose of 60mg/dl, and PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After 47 days, a BAL culture conversion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurred. The drug susceptibility pattern did not show any drug resistances (i.e., isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Patient was discharged from hospital and underwent a new chest CT scan (Figure 1) after 6 months of treatment. It found an improvement of the atelectasis of the right middle lobe, and a decreased size of the subcarinal, right hilar, and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes. ",0
59,S1201971218345211,The use of bedaquiline to treat patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and end-stage renal disease: A case report," Case reports  Patient 1 In August 2016, a 46-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of pre-extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Two months before that visit, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary and peritoneal TB and had commenced first-line drugs. Subsequent phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) revealed pre-XDR-TB, after which he was transferred to our hospital (Table 1 ). The patient exhibited hypertension and ESRD (anuria requiring conventional hemodialysis three times weekly). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Baseline serum creatinine levels were 8.12mg/dl pre-hemodialysis and 3.97mg/dl post-hemodialysis. The baseline QTcF interval was 441ms on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, amikacin, moxifloxacin, cycloserine, linezolid, and bedaquiline after obtaining informed consent. Bedaquiline was started at 200mg three times weekly and was given for 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse reaction related to bedaquiline was encountered. One year after treatment initiation, amikacin and linezolid were permanently discontinued because of a hearing disturbance and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In April 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 607 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire course of treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 469ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.   Patient 2 In September 2016, a 53-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of MDR-TB. He had taken first-line drugs in 2013 and 2014 to treat drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Three months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB once more and placed on first-line drugs. Subsequent DST revealed MDR-TB, and he was then transferred to our hospital (Table 1). The patient exhibited hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C virus infection, and chronic kidney disease (average urine volume 1500ml/day without a requirement for maintenance renal replacement therapy). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for M. tuberculosis were negative. The baseline serum creatinine level was 3.04mg/dl (the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 21.7ml/min/1.73m2). The baseline QTcF interval was 424ms on ECG monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, amikacin, prothionamide, and cycloserine. Unfortunately, acute kidney injury developed 6 days later (the serum creatinine level increased to 5.1mg/dl, combined with oliguria), and amikacin was thus discontinued permanently. After 2 months, bedaquiline was added to the treatment regimen after obtaining informed consent. (Due to administrative issues, bedaquiline could not be started immediately after discontinuing the amikacin.) Bedaquiline was commenced at 400mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200mg three times weekly. In February 2017 (5 months after treatment commencement and 3 months after the addition of bedaquiline), the patient started conventional maintenance hemodialysis (three times weekly) because renal impairment had progressed. Bedaquiline treatment was continued unchanged for a total of 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse drug reaction related to bedaquiline was observed. Five months after treatment initiation, pyrazinamide was replaced by para-aminosalicylic acid because the patient developed gout. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In June 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 653 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 463ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.  ",0
60,S1413867015002147,Oral manifestation of tuberculosis: a case-report," Case-report A 61-year-old male patient with a history of smoking habit and alcohol abuse was being followed up for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy associated with vasculopathy, systemic hypertension, and chronic pancreatitis in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The patient was referred to the Stomatology Unit of the same hospital due to the emergence of lesions on the oral mucosa. Preliminary examination revealed two lesions, each measuring approximately 10mm across and presenting a granulomatous central portion and whitish halo. The lesions were located on the upper lip mucosa near the median line and on the left jugal mucosa adjacent to the labial anterior commissure (Fig. 1A and B, respectively). The patient complained of pain, productive cough for the past 15 days, night sweats, episodic fever in the morning, and slight weight loss in the previous two months. However, these complaints were intermittently made by the patient along the scheduled appointments, which may have added to the difficulty for an early diagnosis of the disease. Samples of lesions were collected by incision and stained according to the hematoxylin–eosin (HE) and Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocols. The pathological report was negative for the presence of alcohol–acid resistant microorganisms (Fig. 2 ). Due to the comparatively low count of microorganisms in the tissues analyzed, the special staining used did not successfully detect the presence of the bacterium. However, since a negative result in this kind of analysis does not rule out TB, a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage was analyzed according to the Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocol, with a positive result for M. tuberculosis. A radiograph of the thorax was suggestive of presence of active infectious disease, manifested as budding tree-like centrilobular nodules in both lungs, especially on the right. In this case report, the pathological analysis of the samples collected from the patient was not conclusive, requiring a Mantoux assay and the investigation of bronchoalveolar lavage in order to confirm the TB suspicion. The Mantoux protocol indicated a 13-mm inflammatory reaction confirming TB. Anti-HIV test was negative. The patient was referred to a pulmonologist for examination and treatment based on the pulmonary extension of the disease (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, 30 days into the treatment the patient died due to the worsening of clinical conditions, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney failure. ",0

Weakness was acute in onset and progressively increasing. In addition to this, the patient had pain in upper back and neck with low-grade fever. There was no history of trauma or any other significant complaint. On physical examination, there was deep midline tenderness in cervical and upper dorsal region of spine. Neurologically, there was motor weakness in all four limbs, and sensations and sphincteric functions were intact. The patient was initially managed by absolute bed rest and supportive treatment. Subsequently, when he was evaluated, ESR and CRP both were raised. Radiograph of cervical spine showed straightening with maintained vertebral height and disc spaces. MRI was suggestive of spondylodiscitis along with phlegmonous soft tissue changes in pre- and para-vertebral region of cervico-dorsal spine extending from C3 to D3 vertebra (Figs. 1 and 2  ). Diagnosis of tuberculosis of cervico-dorsal spine was made on the basis of suggestive history, examination, and relevant investigation. One interesting finding we noticed in this patient was association of ptosis and miosis (Fig. 3 ) in left eye with on-going disease process. Enophthalmos and anhidrosis were not seen. Pupillary light reflex was present along with absent ciliospinal reflex. This led to our diagnosis of Horner's syndrome in left eye, which can be a complication of cervico-dorsal tuberculosis. The patient was managed with antitubercular chemotherapy and immobilization of spine using head halter traction. Neurological complications showed some improvement from 3rd week of treatment. At 4th week, traction was released and spine was immobilized on four post collar. At 3 months, there was complete improvement in motor weakness while ocular complication took longer time to recover. At 6 months, the patient showed complete improvement. ATT was continued for one and a half years. ",0

63,S2173579417302062,"Tuberculosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or both? A case report"," Clinic case report Female, 37, who visited due to periocular pain, red eye, edema and erythema of eyelids as well as proptosis in the left eye, with 3 weeks evolution. Previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed at another hospital 4 months earlier on the basis of clinic and compatible imaging confirmed with quantiferon test. The patient had been treated with a quadruple approach comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) during 3 months. At the visit, treatment consisted in rifampicin and isoniazid, which achieved complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. Ophthalmological examination produced a visual acuity of 20/20 in the right eye (RE) and 20/30 in the left eye (LE). The latter was outwardly and forwardly displaced. Hertel exophthalmometry was 12mm in the RE and 21mm in the LE with base in 104. The patient exhibited palpebral edema and erythema, conjunctival chemosis and hyperemia (Fig. 1A). LE ocular motility was moderately limited in all fields of gaze. No intraocular inflammation evidence was found while funduscopy and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. When questioned, the patient denied having other systemic symptoms. After suspecting orbital cellulitis, the patient was hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics without clinic improvement. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), requested upon admission of the patient, revealed a mass in the left orbit compromising the intra-and extra-conal compartments with apparent ethmoidal sinus compromise. The lesion exhibited moderate enhancement with gadolinium (Fig. 1B and C). Taking into account previous TB history, a chest X-ray was taken which showed pleural thickening with increased vascular pattern in the middle lobe of the right lung and inferior cavitations in the left lung (Fig. 2A). Hemogram showed anemia with 10.5g/dl hemoglobin and leukopenia of 3900cells/ml of leukocytes and platelets at 405,000cells/ml. C-reactive protein was positive at 1:160, with increased globular sedimentation velocity of 47mm/h. Creatinine clearing in 24-hour urine was slightly diminished at 51.8ml/min. ELISA test for HIV was negative. Test for hepatitis C, VDRL, FTA-ABS, rheumatoid factor and serum PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were likewise negative. Orbit biopsy was performed through anterior orbitotomy, which evidenced fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels with inflammatory infiltrates comprising lymphocytes, neutrophiles and some eosinophiles (Fig. 2B and C). With these findings, ANCA PR3 (c-ANCA) and MPO (p-ANCA) were analyzed, finding elevated levels of PR3 (c-ANCA) up to 59U/ml. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with GP. Treatment consisted in oral prednisone and 100mg/day cyclophosphamide during 10 months. Thereafter, treatment was switched to methotrexate which produced complete and sustained resolution of the orbit inflammation (Fig. 3A). Hertel exopthalmometry diminished to 17mm in the LE although ocular motility of this eye persisted with a limitation of ?1 for elevation and adduction, without subjective diplopia. Post-treatment orbital computerized tomography (CT) showed diminished mass in the orbit and proptosis. It also evidenced left rhinosinus disease (Fig. 3B and C). After 3 years of sustained remission, medical treatment was suspended. A few weeks later, the patient began to exhibit left diffuse anterior scleritis that resolved completely after medical treatment. Following this episode, immunosuppressant treatment was resumed. With a follow-up of 3 years, the patient remains stable and without vasculitis relapse in treatment with azathioprine and low dose of prednisone. ",0
64,S2211753916300598,Chronic Paracoccidioidomycosis with adrenal involvement mimicking tuberculosis – A case report from Austria," 2 Case A 62-year-old man was transferred from a community hospital to our department due to suspected diagnosis of reactivated tuberculosis of the lungs and adrenal glands in February 2015 (day 0). He reported left-sided chest and abdominal pain, weight loss of 12kg during the last 3 weeks as well as night sweats and cough. The punctum maximum of the abdominal pain was located at the left costal margin and aggravated at inspiration. Past medical history revealed several episodes of tuberculosis with involvement of the lungs, testes and adrenal glands ( Fig. 1). The patient reported that tuberculosis was diagnosed for the first time at the age of 7 years, followed by reactivations in the lungs with dissemination to the testes at the age of 14 and 21. Therefore, the patient had received tuberculostatic therapy, repeatedly. In 2010, he underwent CT-guided biopsy of a suspicious pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe and left adrenal gland due to considerable enlargement of adrenal glands. Based on the histopathological finding of epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis, the diagnosis of tuberculosis of lungs and adrenal glands was made. At that time, sputum smear, PCR and culture for acid fast bacilli were negative. Due to increasing size of the adrenal glands the patient underwent a second biopsy in the same hospital in 2012. Histopathological finding were similar to previous biopsy and again considered to be tuberculosis. From the year 1997 until 2001 he made yearly visits – each for several weeks - to a village in Regio de Pasco (Peru), a rural area located next to the rainforest of the Amazonas. He lived there in a house with a garden for approximately three years (2002–2004) and helped to construct a hospital. He did no agricultural or field work. During his stay in Peru he had no injury or disease worth mentioning. Except for two days in Arica (Chile) he did not visit any other South or Central American regions or countries. In addition, he reported that one day he recognized bats in the ceiling of his house and inhaled their excrements during cleaning. In addition to tuberculosis our patient had a past medical history of chronic bronchitis, Billroth II surgery due to peptic ulcer disease, cholecystectomy and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy approximately 10 years ago. The patient was a retired patient transport service driver in an Austrian hospital. Family history revealed a tuberculosis infection of his father. He was a current smoker with a history of 45 pack years, reported occasional alcohol consumption and no known allergies. He was on no chronic medication. Upon admission, the patient appeared in a good general condition with normal body temperature and a blood pressure of 120/70mmHg. Auscultation and percussion of lungs and heart were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft and showed periumbilical tenderness without resistance. Peripheral edema was not observed. Basic neurological examination and skin were unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with 78 beats per minute and no pathological findings. There was a mild eosinophilia (6%) and monocytosis (16%), but total white cell count (8.1G/l), hemoglobin (13.9g/dl), and platelet count (366G/l) were within normal limits. Levels of serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were normal. The concentration of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT, 193U/l), alkaline phosphatase (224U/l), and C-reactive protein (9.0mg/dl), plasma fibrinogen (560mg/dl), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 54/81mm) were elevated. Serum albumin (3.4g/dl) and sodium (135mmol/l) were slightly decreased while other electrolytes were normal. Myocardial biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin-T (hs-TnT), creatine kinase (CK) and muscle-brain type creatine kinase (CK-MB) were within normal range. Computed tomography (CT) showed postspecific pulmonary lesions. Compared to previous examinations, abdominal CT (day +0) revealed an increasing inhomogeneous enlargement of the adrenal glands (4.0×6.3cm) ( Fig. 2). Additionally, several enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenterial lymph nodes were found. Subsequently performed positron emission tomography (PET) (day +18) revealed an increased metabolic activity in bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands. Furthermore, hypermetabolic activity of cervical lymph nodes and the laryngeal area was found. Clinical and radiographic findings were suspicious for reactivation of tuberculosis. Interferon-gamma release assay (Quantiferon) (day +7) was positive but Ziehl-Neelsen smear, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of the sputum were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lues and adrenal autoantibodies were negative. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms such as tremor, disturbance of sensitivity and weakness of the extremities, triggered a neurological work-up. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (day +31) revealed a round temporo-parietal located lesion with perifocal edema, suspicious for infection or metastasis ( Fig. 3). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture (day +34) was unremarkable without any sign for infection, inflammation or neoplasm. Neurosurgeons did not consider surgical intervention. The cause of hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal enlargement remained unclear, initially. Tuberculosis was suspected but could not be confirmed by microbiology. Hence, CT guided biopsy of the left adrenal gland and extirpation of a right cervical lymph node (day +42) were performed for histopathological and microbiological work-up. Neither in the biopsy specimens of left adrenal gland nor the right cervical lymph node, Ziehl-Neelsen and PCR revealed any evidence for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (day +45). Serology for various systemic fungal infections and broad spectrum PCR from blood and aspirate fluids from biopsy (day +49) were negative as well. Histology of lymph node and left adrenal gland biopsy showed granulomas with central necrosis (day +48). In addition, in the left adrenal gland periodic acid–schiff (PAS), McManus, and methenamine silver stain (Grocott) revealed evidence of fungal pathogens. Giemsa stain of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen (day +49) showed characteristic yeast elements with multipolar budding of variable size thus indicating the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Fig. 4). Cultures of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen, were positive after incubation for 5 days (day +54) at 37°C and 28°C on Columbia agar (with 5% sheep blood; bioMérieux, Austria), 2% Sabouraud dextrose agar (Oxoid, Austria) and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI agar, Merck, Austria). Sequence analysis of the isolate confirmed the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sequence similarity was assessed by a search of homology not only with GenBank sequences, but also with the ISHAM ITS database. 100% identity was achieved with both databases (ISHAM identification number: MITS2102). Thus, we diagnosed paracoccidioidomycosis with dissemination to adrenal glands and highly suspicious involvement of cervical lymph nodes and the brain. When paracoccidioidomycosis was suspected, the specimen and all cultures were processed in a special laboratory for biosafety level 3 (S3-laboratory). This laboratory has all the equipment and safety features required for biosafety level 3 with controlled air flow and filtered ventilation systems. All personnel wore personal protective equipment (specialized clothing, gloves whenever handling the specimens or cultures). In accordance to this, personnel had the utmost protection against accidental infection. After identification of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antifungal treatment was initiated ( Table 1). In addition, replacement therapy with fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone was prescribed. Due to the evidence of cerebral involvement the patient was initially treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. The patient's general clinical condition improved and the antifungal therapy was switched to oral itraconazole. However, itraconazole never reached therapeutic level - neither with capsule nor liquid formulation, most probably due to the previous Billroth II resection. After deterioration of the patient and an increase in inflammatory parameters, liposomal amphotericin B was restarted. Associated with worsening of the systemic inflammation, hypotension, prerenal kidney failure and subsequent Addison crises occurred, so that hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone doses had to be adapted and high volume intravenous (IV) fluids substituted. Several ultrasound imaging studies showed a continuous decrease in size of the bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and a follow-up MRI of the brain revealed a shrinking size of the cerebral lesion. Overall clinical improvement was observed. After consultation of an infectious disease specialist, our patient was switched to oral posaconazole. Finally, the patient was discharged in a good general condition on oral posaconazole. ",0
65,S120197121834431X,First case of sexually transmitted asymptomatic female genital tuberculosis from spousal epididymal tuberculosis diagnosed by active screening," Case reports  Patient 1 (index case) A 54-year-old man noticed a swelling of the right epididymis approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. He was initially considered to have acute epididymitis. Although the causative organism could not be identified by urine testing, he was prescribed oral levofloxacin. The swelling of the epididymis recurred several times and was relieved by levofloxacin each time. However, approximately 1.5 years before the diagnosis, the left epididymis also started to swell gradually. A left orchiectomy was performed, because a tumor of the epididymis was suspected. Pathological findings of the resected testis revealed multinucleated giant cells and numerous caseous granulomas. He was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases because tuberculosis was highly suspected. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with epididymal tuberculosis based on urine PCR, urine culture, and histopathological findings. Additionally, a T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and HIV antibody test were both negative. Findings on chest computed tomography (CT) scan were unremarkable except for calcification of a mediastinal lymph node. He had been diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years earlier, which had been resected; there had been no recurrence at the time of presentation. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated was susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, levofloxacin, and streptomycin. Treatment was commenced with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a further 4 months.   Patient 2 (infected spouse) A 53-year-old woman visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Toranomon Hospital with her husband (patient 1) to inquire about the possibility of sexual transmission of tuberculosis approximately 1 month after his diagnosis. They were worried, although she looked healthy and had no symptoms: no fever, night sweats, weight loss, pelvic or abdominal pain, menstrual disorder, or respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and cough. She had been having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband once a week until 6 months before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. However, she had then refrained from sexual intercourse with her husband when they noticed the apparent swelling of his left epididymis because she was afraid of contracting a sexually transmitted infection from him. She had no past history of illnesses or operations, except for migraine at about 20 years of age and bilateral tubal ligation at about 35 years of age after the delivery of their third child. She reported having no other sexual partners after marriage. Finally, it was decided to perform active screening for genital tuberculosis even though she was asymptomatic. Laboratory findings of blood and urine testing were unremarkable. A T-SPOT.TB test and HIV antibody test were both negative. Chest and abdominal CT scans that included the pelvic area were unremarkable. Furthermore, a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound performed by a gynecologist were unremarkable except for a right ovarian cyst. A biopsy was not performed because no abnormal findings were observed in the endocervical canal or endometrium at that time. However, vaginal swab culture yielded M. tuberculosis and she was diagnosed with genital tuberculosis. Treatment for tuberculosis was started with the same regimen as that of her husband. Both M. tuberculosis isolates were sent to the Research Institute of Tuberculosis (Tokyo, Japan) for further analysis. Variable number tandem repeat analysis (VNTR, 24 loci) showed that the organisms from the two cases were identical (Iwamoto et al., 2012). Further analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS; MiSeq, Illumina) confirmed that the two isolates were genetically identical with only one nucleotide difference (Sekizuka et al., 2015).  ",0
67,S2214442014000941,Tuberculosis of the Spermatic Cord: Case Report," Case presentation A 44-year-old patient with no medical history of personal or family tuberculosis showed a 4-cm painful swelling on the right testicle, which had appeared 3 months earlier. The patient had not lost weight and showed no sign of infection. Testicle ultrasonography revealed an isoechoic, cylindrical, paratesticular structure, measuring 4 cm in its largest diameter. Routine blood and urine tests were within normal values with no inflammatory signs. Alpha Foetoprotein and beta Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin were normal. No tuberculosis skin test was performed. A surgery was performed, revealing an indurated right spermatic cord caught in a fibrous magma extending from the tail of the epididymis to the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 1 ). The fibrous cord was dissected and isolated from all the elements of the spermatic cord, with preservation of the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels. The testes were reinstated in purse. Histology showed on a 4 × 2 × 1 cm specimen, an epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomatous process with foci of caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). A checkup was made afterward revealing no other tuberculous location. The patient was given a 6-month antituberculous treatment: 2 (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol) + 4 (rifampicin + isoniazid) with a satisfying uneventful evolution. ",0
68,S1054880716300102,“Death at the wheel” due to tuberculosis of the myocardium: a case report," 2 Case report The body of a 35-year-old adult African male was admitted to our medicolegal mortuary, the deceased having been the driver of a motor vehicle that had apparently inexplicably veered off the road and collided with a tree at relatively low speed. No specific history of prior cardiac problems or other underlying medical conditions could be established. At autopsy, the deceased was well-nourished, measuring 1.8m in length and with a body mass of 108kg. There were no external injuries. Internal examination revealed a grossly enlarged heart with a mass of 540g, but with only modestly increased epicardial fat deposits. Further dissection revealed extensive, partially confluent yellow to white nodular infiltrates involving the walls of all cardiac chambers. The nodules varied from 5 to 15mm in diameter and had a firm, rubbery consistency (Fig. 1 ). Macroscopically, the lungs and kidneys showed no overt signs of disease, but sectioning of the spleen revealed multiple small white parenchymal nodules measuring 1–2mm in diameter, in keeping with miliary TB. Histological examination of the heart showed well-formed granulomas that were present in the full thickness of the myocardium on some of the sections. These granulomas consisted of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes and Langhans type as well as multinucleated giant cells with central areas of caseous necrosis. No eosinophils, Aschoff cells or asteroid bodies noted (Fig. 2 ). Histological examination of the kidneys showed no abnormalities with no granulomas present but histology of the lungs and spleen revealed a similar granulomatous inflammatory process as seen in the heart. The histological examination of the lung and spleen is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4  . However, multiple attempts at demonstrating acid-fast bacilli from several sites of the myocardium by using the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain were unsuccessful (Fig. 5 ). The PAS stain on the myocardial tissue was negative (Fig. 6 ). ZN staining of the lungs and spleen was also negative. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was further performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue but again a negative result ensued. Despite the negative outcome of the special investigations and based primarily on the macroscopic and histological findings, a final diagnosis of TB with involvement of the myocardium was made. ",0

72,S221255311600008X,Chronic oozing skin lesions in children: Possible tuberculosis? Two case reports," Case 2 A 5-year-old female presented with multiple swellings and discharging sinuses (oozing thick, whitish fluid) over the skin of the left upper part of the neck and submandibular area. The surrounding skin was purple-blue in color with elevated edges. Six months later, the patient developed two upper-left cervical swellings and one submandibular swelling that was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics with no response. These swellings began to open by fistula to the outer skin, oozing thick white fluid (Fig. 4 ). The patient had no history of chest disease and no chest symptoms, and no contact history with a TB-related case. Routine biochemical analysis, complete blood count, and urine analysis were all normal. ESR was 70 for the 1st hour, and the chest radiograph was normal. The tuberculin test was positive (induration 22mm×24mm), and a quantiferon TB gold test was positive. Gastric lavage was negative for mycobacteria. Swabs from the discharging fluid were sent for pyogenic culture and culture for acid-fast bacilli. A neck ultrasound revealed multiple bilateral-cervical, left-supraclavicular, and left-axillary lymph nodes (LNs) ranging from 1.4cm to 1.7cm. Some of the cervical and supraclavicular LNs were forming cystic turbid abscesses from 0.7cm to 2.3cm in size. Skin and LN biopsy was done, with the skin showing dense dermal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells and minimal epithelioid granulomata and sinus-tract formation. The LN architecture was mostly replaced with caseating epithelioid granuloma with few multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 5 ). Both patients received Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. A scar is now present at the site of injection. The patient had no history of previous pulmonary TB since birth, and developmental and family histories were unremarkable, with no family members having a history of TB. ",0
73,S2352621116000061,A case report of atypical sarcoidosis misdiagnosed as tuberculosis," 2 Case report A 49 years old, female patient was hospitalized for abdominal discomfort, low grade fever (with the highest body temperature to be 37.8 °C) and long time cough lasting for about half a month. The cough presented as irritating cough accompanied with nausea, but without phlegm and emesis. It is known that the patient is healthy ordinarily and no obvious inducement was found for these above mentioned symptoms. Therefore, a series of regular examinations were carried out, including laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, CT scanning, and biopsy and pathological diagnosis. The regular laboratory examination was showed in Table 1 . Additionally, plenty of lymphocytes and less mesothelial cells were detected in pleural effusions, without finding heterocyst. For the bronchoscopy, no obstruction was visible within the left principal bronchus and its branches. No hyperaemia, edema and erosion were found in the lumen mucous membrane. No stenosis and neoplasm were visible within the lumen. Mucous membrane was normal in the right upper lobe bronchus while mild hyperemia was found in the mucosa of right lower lobe bronchus, and the corresponding lumen showed with mild distortion and obvious neoplasm development. It was shown with bronchial ridge hypertrophy and enlargement. There was apparent stenosis in the lateral bronchus of the middle-lobe, showing with white moss-like secretions. The bronchial mucosa was a bit brittle and would bleed when touched. For regular CT examination, irregular pulmonary consolidation was presented in the middle and lower lobes around the right hilum, with mean CT value of 44HU; bronchus shadow with narrowed lumen was visible inside the lumen, and swelling lymph node shadow was likely to be visible in the mediastinum; and, a small amount of pleural effusion was presented in the right thorax, while no obvious abnormity was visible in the left one (Fig. 1 ). For the contrast enhanced CT scanning, equally enhancing lesions were presented inside the lung and around pulmonary hilus, with the mean CT value of 98HU during arterial phase (Fig. 2 A), and local stenosis occurred inside the pulmonary artery; by contrast, during the venous phase, the mean CT value was 98 HU (Fig. 2B); multiple lymphadenectasis presented as equal enhancements were found within the right pulmonary hilus and mediastinum (behind the left atrium), while multiple small nodular shadows were visible in the right pleura; and no obvious lymphadenectasis was presented in the left pulmonary hilus.  2.1 Biopsy and pathological examination Biopsy was carried out for the right pleura under thoracoscope, and it was shown that about 500 ml pale yellow effusion was presented in the right thorax, and there were also pleural edema, thickening and adhesion in the right chest. Unequal multiple small nodules with diameters from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm was found on the right side of the pleura, mediastinum, pericardium and pulmonary surface, and lump appeared around the right pulmonary hilus (Fig. 3 ). For further confirmation, the pathological diagnosis was carried out, which showed granulomatous inflammation accompanied with small necrosis, and the possibility of tuberculosis was not excluded. The results of acid fast stain were showed in Fig. 3. Ultrasonic bronchial endoscopy (Ebus) was carried out under general anesthesia, and the lymph node on the punctured right bronchus (region 4R) and subcarinal (region 7) lymph node were sent for biopsy, of which the results showed noncaseating granulomas (Fig. 4 ).

74,S2210261217301931,Ileocaecal and transverse colonic tuberculosis mimicking colonic malignancy – A case report," 2 Case presentation A 46year old female patient came walking to the outpatient department with a 6 month history of diffuse abdominal pain with low grade fever and loss of appetite and weight. No significant past medical or surgical history. There was no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On examination, general condition was fair, vitals were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a soft non tender abdomen with a normal digital per rectal examination. Haematological investigations were normal except erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) which was 80mm (0–30mm normal). Her serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA), cancer antigen19-9(CA 19-9) and serum adenosine deaminase(ADA) levels were within normal limits. Contrast enhanced CT(CECT) abdomen revealed a diffuse concentric long segmental circumferential wall thickening of terminal ileum, ileocaecal(IC) junction and ascending colon with peripheral fat stranding and lymphadenopathy with narrowing at the splenic flexure (Figs. 1–3   ). Colonoscopy showed an ulceronodular lesion with lumen compromise at the splenic flexure and thickening of the ileocaecal junction. Biopsy was taken from both the sites and sent for histopathological examination and also for culture and gene xpert for MTB. Pathology showed moderate mixed inflammation and occasional lymphoid collection in the lamina propria with no evidence of malignancy. There were also occasional crypt abscesses which raised suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. The final diagnosis of tuberculosis of the intestine was made as the biopsy smear showed AFBs and the Gene Xpert detected MTB. The patient was/started on Anti tubercular therapy. At 6 month follow up, patient is asymptomatic. Repeat CT scan shows no narrowing (Fig. 4 ). ",0
75,S1930043318302334,Pelvic tuberculosis: a forgotten diagnosis – case report," Case report An African14-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric disease department for investigation of an adnexal mass. Five months before admission, she immigrated to Portugal from Angola. One month after being in Portugal, she started feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, daily somnolence, and a persistent dry cough. She was medicated with an antihistaminic with some improvement of the cough. As the symptoms persisted, she had some laboratory tests, which showed microcytic hypochromic anemia that was medicated with iron replacement therapy. Two months later, she went to the emergency department due to aggravating symptoms, fever (of irregular pattern), weight loss (4 kg in 1 month), a low abdominal pain, and pain with inspiration in the right hemithorax. There was no associated past medical or surgical history and no history of recent disease in her family circle. She had no other signs or symptoms, namely, no menstrual disturbances (menarcha at 10 years), no urinary, respiratory (the cough subsided), or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination, a palpable painful hypogastric mass was found, hard on palpation and of irregular contours. A BCG vaccination scar was visible. She had an ultrasound (Fig. 1 ) that showed a large pelvic mass (about 12?×?8 cm), centered in the right adnexal area, predominantly cystic, complex, encapsulated, with multiple thin septa and a solid component that exhibited some vascularity in the Color Doppler study (Fig. 1b), creating a mass effect on the uterus and bladder. The left ovary was heterogeneous and mildly enlarged (not shown). There were associated terminal ileum, peritoneal thickening (Fig. 2 ), and mild ascitis. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR; Fig. 3 ) documented a complex cystic mass, apparently having its epicenter on the right adnexal area, with high signal in T2W sequences and intermediate-to-low signal in T1W sequence, with no saturation on fat-suppressed sequences. The multiple septa were thin, irregular, and had no definite enhancement on post gadolinium sequences. A solid enhancing component was not confirmed. Upon scrolling the sagittal images, the lesion suggested to be contiguous with the uterine horn and terminating at the right ovary, hence a hydropyosalpingitis was neither confirmed nor excluded. There was some distortion of ileal loops that were hard to characterize as they were retracted and adherent close together and in apposition with the mass. Despite this, the lesion seemed to be encapsulated and well defined. Some peritoneal enhancement was noted. No adenopathies were visible in the pelvis or in the lomboaortic chains. Chest radiograph (Fig. 4 a) revealed an obliteration of the right costophrenic angle extending upwards along the lateral wall, suggesting a loculated effusion. The corresponding chest ultrasound (Fig. 4b and c) exhibited a pleural effusionat the right lung base, anechogenic, with some thin septa, extending superiorly to the middle lung and causing passive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. Laboratory investigations elicited a normal leucogram and C-reactive protein (CRP), persistence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia (9.1 g/dL) and an elevated CA-125 (576 U/mL, normal values <35 U/mL). As an ovarian malignant tumor was suspected, she was submitted to an exploratory laparotomy with the intent of an eventual resection. A large right adnexal whitish mass was found, occupying the small pelvis, with an uninterrupted capsule, from which adhesions emanated to the bladder and ileon bowel walls, preventing it from resection. There was extensive perilesional inflammatory reaction, adherent to the peritoneal fat and lateral wall of the pelvic region, and multiple lesions with morphology suggestive of implants to the wall of the ileal loops in contact with the mass and in the peritoneum adjacent to the mass. The biopsy of the lesion revealed numerous granulomata with giant cells but no caseous necrosis and no evidence of neoplastic cells. Further laboratory testing revealed an elevated seric ADA (83 U/L, normal ranges being 4.8-23 U/L). As the results of the initial mass sample testing were nonspecific, she was submitted to an ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic lesion and a diagnostic thoracocentesis (also ultrasound guided). The tuberculin skin testing (TST/Mantoux) was marginally positive (13 mm). Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON testing was negative but further testing with IGRA T-SPOT was positive, substantiating the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis. Pleural liquid analysis revealed a very elevated LDH (1083 U/L, 5 times the normal seric value) and elevated ADA (188 U/L, normal being < 45 U/L), with normal leucocyte count. No BK was identified either by PCR or cultural exam. The mass aspirate was PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Almost 1 month later, cultural examination became positive for M. tuberculosis. She started antibacillary therapy with progressive symptomatic and overall improvement. After 8 months on combined antibacillary therapy, ultrasonography (Fig. 5 ) exhibited a residual complex cystic lesion in the right adnexal area, with some distortion of normal ovarian morphology. CA-125 returned to normal values. ",0
76,S193004331830339X,Rare radiological features of abdominopelvic tuberculosis: A case report," Case presentation A 26-year-old woman, para 1 lived 1, was referred to our medical center with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient noted that for the last 3 months she had been gradually experiencing intermittent vaginal bleeding, as well as progressive hypogastric and bilateral lower quadrants abdominal pain. The abdominal pain did not spread to any other spots and did not get relieved or aggravated by any factors. The patient noted that she had no history of any specific diseases. Furthermore, her menstrual cycles had always been regular and previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient also complained of weakness and 5 kg of weight loss (67–62 kg) in the past 3 months. The patient did not report the symptoms of urinary tract infection, coughing and sputum, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, recent travel, and history of any malignancies in her family. Upon examination, the blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg, temperature was 37.8?C, pulse rate was 88 bpm, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. There was a mild tenderness in both the lower quadrants without rebound tenderness. Her abdomen was mildly distended but the shifting dullness examination was negative and there were firm, mobile, and ill-defined edge masses in both lower quadrants. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography showed multicystic adnexal masses; because of the adhesions in the peritoneal cavity, it was impossible to identify peritoneal fluid collection from the cystic enlargement of the ovaries. For further evaluation, the abdominopelvic computed tomography scan was done which demonstrated a multicystic adnexal mass of 2.6?×?2.3 cm with an inaccurate site of origin and diffused nodular peritoneal and omental thickening (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's level of cancer antigen (CA), at 125, was more than the normal range (145 U/mL), but the alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotrophin levels were normal. Her chest X-ray was also normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a microcytic anemia, normal leukocyte count and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80 mm/hr). Laparotomy was performed on the patient due to the mass observed in the ovary and increased serum levels of CA-125 with the presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Lots of adhesions and ovaries covered with granulomatosis lesions were observed. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy were conducted and biopsies from the omentum and peritoneum were taken. Surgery was performed without any complications and no complications occurred postoperatively. Histopathology revealed that fragments of fibroconnective tissue contain numerous well-formed granulomas with extensive caseous necrosis, which was highly indicative of tuberculosis. After that, the result of acid-fast stains confirmed tuberculosis. After the diagnosis of tuberculosis, she underwent antituberculosis treatment.   ",0
78,S1054880715001210,Pancardiac tuberculosis — a case report," 2 Case history A 14-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with complaints of progressive dyspnea, chest pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss since 1 year. She weighed 27 kg for an expected weight of 41 kg. Her pulse was 90/min; respiratory rate was 16/min. There was bilateral pedal edema. Her hemoglobin was 9.4 gm%; total count was 6100/cm2 with 80% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes. Her liver function tests and renal function tests were in normal limits. X-ray chest was performed and showed cardiomegaly. However, there was no calcification noted in the pericardium. A 2D echo showed a thick pericardium about 10 mm, right atrial enlargement, and depressed left ventricular function; Left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] was 40% suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Her condition deteriorated, and she expired on the second day of hospital stay. A complete postmortem was performed. She was an averagely build and poorly nourished female. She had mild pallor and bilateral pedal edema. Examination of chest cavity showed 300-ml pleural effusion on right side. Both the lungs showed 1-mm pinhead sized tubercles on the pleural as well as the cut surface. Heart was enlarged, globular, and weighed 1440 g. Visceral and parietal pericardiums were thickened and opaque, adherent to each other and to the lungs and diaphragm suggestive of pericarditis (Fig. 1 ). On cut section, pericardium was 10-mm thick whitish opaque and firmly adherent to the myocardium. There were multiple diffused white nodular lesions with caseation seen in the pericardium, myocardium reaching up to the endocardium with focal ulceration of the endocardium (Figs. 2 and 3  ). All the chambers of the heart along with the interventricular septum showed involvement by similar lesions. Mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged and matted together; cut surface showed caseation. Spleen and liver also showed multiple miliary tubercles. Brain showed cerebral edema. All the rest of the organs were unremarkable. Histopathological examination of the heart showed extensive areas of caseation with epithelioid cells, Langhan's giant cells, and lymphocytesin in the pericardium, myocardium, and endocardium (Fig. 4 ). Epithelioid cell granulomas with and without caseation were seen in the mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, spleen, and liver. Acid fast bacilli [AFB] stain was done on the section of the heart which was positive for acid-fast bacilli. This case had disseminated tuberculosis with pan cardiac involvement. ",0
79,S1110663818300041,Isolated nasopharyngeal tuberculosis in a 12?year old boy – A case report," Case report A 12?year old boy presented with nasal obstruction since 8?months. He had presented with open mouth and snoring during sleep. Anterior rhinoscopic examination revealed middle turbinate hypertrophy and pale appearance of nasal septum. Diagnostic nasal endoscopic examination showed vegetative mass with smooth surface at the nasopharynx (Fig. 1 ). Rest of the ENT examinations and routine blood investigations were within normal limit. Sputum microscopy and culture were negative for acid fast bacilli whereas bacteriological examination from nasopharyngeal swab showed acid-fast bacilli and the quenching probe PCR test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no evidence of active pulmonary and systemic tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT scan) was done to rule out any mass and its extent at the nasopharynx. CT scan showed large mass occupying the nasopharynx (Fig. 2 ). A bit of tissue was taken from nasopharynx with help of endoscopy under local anesthesia and histopathological examination revealed caseous granulomatous lesion, non-necrotizing granuloma under the ciliated respiratory mucosa. The granulation tissue showed coagulation necrosis and Langerhans type of giant cells at the center (Fig. 3 ). No malignant cells were seen and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Patient was treated with antitubercular therapy (ATT) of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9?months. Patient was clinically improved in third month of treatment and the nasopharyngeal mass was resolved around 4th month months of ATT. ",0
80,S2214442018300810,A case report: Addison disease caused by adrenal tuberculosis," Case report A 43-year-old man was admitted for the evaluation of Addison's disease. He complain of depression, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, joint pain, skin hyper-pigmentation, nails, mouth and mucous membranes of the lips. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal and neurologic examination showed no abnormalities. Laboratory serum cortisol <0.05 ?gr/dl (Normal range: 3.09–16.6 ?g/dL). Investigation of the causes of this adrenal hipofunction due to tuberculosis by blood sedimentation rate, Mantoux test show negative results. Following to Interferon Gamma Release Assay, IGRA test also show negative results. Upper abdominal MRI shows bilateral adrenal (right AP 5.59 × LL 5.56 × CC 4.46 cm; left AP 4.74 × LL 4.12 × CC 5.66 cm) with regular edges, bilateral adrenal hypertrophy suspects with differential diagnosis of adrenal adenomas (see Fig. 1 ).

82,S2210261218302311,Rare case of sacrococcygeal tuberculosis mimicking as an anal fistula," 2 Presentation of case A 93-year-old Japanese man who presented with gluteal and coccygeal pain was referred to our hospital. Furthermore, discharging were observed in his fistula in the posterior peri-anal region. He had neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. He had history of pulmonary TB at 25 years of age, and underwent surgery for the removal of complex anal fistula at 75 years of age at another institution. Based on clinical examination, there were two fistulous orifices between the anus and coccyx with purulent discharge (Fig. 1 ). He did not present with cough, fever, weight loss, and anorexia. The chest radiograph result was normal, and hematologic examination showed no abnormalities, except for a slight elevation in C-reactive protein level. Fistulography showed a complex supra-elevator track that is connected to the pre-sacral area and another track ending blindly behind the rectum. The connection between the track and the rectum or anus was not identified on fistulography (Fig. 2 ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole body reveled a lytic destruction of the sacrum (S3-5) and coccyx, with a low-density area in front of the sacrum, suggesting fluid collection (Fig. 3 A). No abnormality was found in the lungs and other vertebrae on CT scan. Colonoscopy findings showed normal colorectal mucosa and no evidence of fistula. Based on these radiological findings and the past medical history of the patient, the recurrence of complex anal fistula with osteomyelitis, or metastatic bone tumor of unknown origin, was suspected. Bacterial examination of the fistula discharge showed normal bacterial culture and was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). However, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using COBAS TaqMan MTB test (Roche Molecular Systems, the USA) was used to test the cold abscess fluid, and results showed that the patient was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AFB test and PCR were negative for sputum. However, the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, the UK) blood test result was positive. Thus, the diagnosis of isolated sacrococcygeal TB was confirmed. The patient was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 7 months. The patient’s pain resolved, and the purulent drainage stopped within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on the physical findings, closure of the fistula was not achieved. However, the PCR test result for PCR DNA turned to be negative. A follow-up CT scan was carried out during treatment, and results showed that fluid collection in front of sacrum had disappeared (Fig. 3B). ",0
83,S120197121830047X,A case-report of a pulmonary tuberculosis with lymphadenopathy mimicking a lymphoma," Case report A 22-year-old Somalian male was referred to the Respiratory Diseases Unit of the university hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, in June 2016. He complained of thoracic pain during his stay in an immigrant reception center, without reporting fever, cough, or any clinically significant comorbidities. The physical examination showed enlarged, not movable, and tender latero-cervical lymph nodes, as well as crackles in the right emi-thorax. Chest X-ray showed a right middle lobe atelectasis and increased bronchovascular markings. Blood examinations showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6g/dl (suspected hypochromic and microcytic anemia), a white blood cell count of 3,930 cells/mm3 (55% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes, 2% eosinophils), and a platelet count of 311,000 cells/mm (Davies et al., 2008). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (6.24mg/dl and 113mm/h, respectively); gamma-globulins on electrophoresis were high but without any monoclonal spikes. His renal and liver function tests were within normal range. Total IgE were 4,820IU/ml. Albumin level was below the normal values (4.00g/dl). A chest CT scan (Figure 1 ) with contrast infusion showed a generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly in the following anatomical sites: latero-cervical (sized ?25–50mm), supraclavicular, subclavian, mediastinal, and sub-diaphragmatic. Para-tracheal, para-cardiac, and right hilar lymph nodes were confluent and enlarged (diameter size: ?30–50mm); furthermore, a right middle lobe collapse, a tree-in bud parenchymal infiltrate, and a right shift of trachea and its bifurcation were found. Spleen showed multiple and rounded lesions. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were smear- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only lymphocytes (CD3+ 90%, CD4+ 68% CD8+ 17%, CD4+/CD8+ 4) were found in the BAL cellular count. A trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the right para-tracheal lymph node was performed; however, the histological pattern was not specific (i.e., non-specific chronic inflammation). Ultrasound scans suggested a lymphoproliferative disorder based on the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, liver enlargement, and small, multiple spleen abscesses. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node. A chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells and central necrosis was found in the histopathological examination. Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott, and Ziehl-Nielsen stained slides did not show any abnormal findings. Immunohistochemistry did not detect tumor cellular markers (i.e., AE1/AE3, CD3, CD20). Based on the clinical features, an empirical anti-TB treatment was started (ethambutol 1.2g/day, isoniazid 300mg/day, rifampicin 600mg/day, pyrazinamide 1.5g/day). However, his clinical conditions rapidly worsened (abdominal pain, vomit, fever, dehydration, elevated liver transaminases levels). One week after TB treatment initiation a left pleural effusion occurred (then, classified as TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). A sample of 2,000ml of pleuritic liquid was collected: it was limpid yellowish, with LDH level of 369U/L, total protein of 4.7g/dl, glucose of 60mg/dl, and PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After 47 days, a BAL culture conversion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurred. The drug susceptibility pattern did not show any drug resistances (i.e., isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Patient was discharged from hospital and underwent a new chest CT scan (Figure 1) after 6 months of treatment. It found an improvement of the atelectasis of the right middle lobe, and a decreased size of the subcarinal, right hilar, and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes. ",0
84,S1201971218345211,The use of bedaquiline to treat patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and end-stage renal disease: A case report," Case reports  Patient 1 In August 2016, a 46-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of pre-extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Two months before that visit, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary and peritoneal TB and had commenced first-line drugs. Subsequent phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) revealed pre-XDR-TB, after which he was transferred to our hospital (Table 1 ). The patient exhibited hypertension and ESRD (anuria requiring conventional hemodialysis three times weekly). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Baseline serum creatinine levels were 8.12mg/dl pre-hemodialysis and 3.97mg/dl post-hemodialysis. The baseline QTcF interval was 441ms on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, amikacin, moxifloxacin, cycloserine, linezolid, and bedaquiline after obtaining informed consent. Bedaquiline was started at 200mg three times weekly and was given for 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse reaction related to bedaquiline was encountered. One year after treatment initiation, amikacin and linezolid were permanently discontinued because of a hearing disturbance and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In April 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 607 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire course of treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 469ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.   Patient 2 In September 2016, a 53-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of MDR-TB. He had taken first-line drugs in 2013 and 2014 to treat drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Three months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB once more and placed on first-line drugs. Subsequent DST revealed MDR-TB, and he was then transferred to our hospital (Table 1). The patient exhibited hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C virus infection, and chronic kidney disease (average urine volume 1500ml/day without a requirement for maintenance renal replacement therapy). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for M. tuberculosis were negative. The baseline serum creatinine level was 3.04mg/dl (the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 21.7ml/min/1.73m2). The baseline QTcF interval was 424ms on ECG monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, amikacin, prothionamide, and cycloserine. Unfortunately, acute kidney injury developed 6 days later (the serum creatinine level increased to 5.1mg/dl, combined with oliguria), and amikacin was thus discontinued permanently. After 2 months, bedaquiline was added to the treatment regimen after obtaining informed consent. (Due to administrative issues, bedaquiline could not be started immediately after discontinuing the amikacin.) Bedaquiline was commenced at 400mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200mg three times weekly. In February 2017 (5 months after treatment commencement and 3 months after the addition of bedaquiline), the patient started conventional maintenance hemodialysis (three times weekly) because renal impairment had progressed. Bedaquiline treatment was continued unchanged for a total of 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse drug reaction related to bedaquiline was observed. Five months after treatment initiation, pyrazinamide was replaced by para-aminosalicylic acid because the patient developed gout. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In June 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 653 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 463ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.  ",0
85,S1413867015002147,Oral manifestation of tuberculosis: a case-report," Case-report A 61-year-old male patient with a history of smoking habit and alcohol abuse was being followed up for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy associated with vasculopathy, systemic hypertension, and chronic pancreatitis in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The patient was referred to the Stomatology Unit of the same hospital due to the emergence of lesions on the oral mucosa. Preliminary examination revealed two lesions, each measuring approximately 10mm across and presenting a granulomatous central portion and whitish halo. The lesions were located on the upper lip mucosa near the median line and on the left jugal mucosa adjacent to the labial anterior commissure (Fig. 1A and B, respectively). The patient complained of pain, productive cough for the past 15 days, night sweats, episodic fever in the morning, and slight weight loss in the previous two months. However, these complaints were intermittently made by the patient along the scheduled appointments, which may have added to the difficulty for an early diagnosis of the disease. Samples of lesions were collected by incision and stained according to the hematoxylin–eosin (HE) and Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocols. The pathological report was negative for the presence of alcohol–acid resistant microorganisms (Fig. 2 ). Due to the comparatively low count of microorganisms in the tissues analyzed, the special staining used did not successfully detect the presence of the bacterium. However, since a negative result in this kind of analysis does not rule out TB, a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage was analyzed according to the Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocol, with a positive result for M. tuberculosis. A radiograph of the thorax was suggestive of presence of active infectious disease, manifested as budding tree-like centrilobular nodules in both lungs, especially on the right. In this case report, the pathological analysis of the samples collected from the patient was not conclusive, requiring a Mantoux assay and the investigation of bronchoalveolar lavage in order to confirm the TB suspicion. The Mantoux protocol indicated a 13-mm inflammatory reaction confirming TB. Anti-HIV test was negative. The patient was referred to a pulmonologist for examination and treatment based on the pulmonary extension of the disease (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, 30 days into the treatment the patient died due to the worsening of clinical conditions, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney failure. ",0
86,S0976566216000412,Horner's syndrome in cervico-dorsal tuberculosis: A rare case report," 2 Case report A 6-year-old male child was brought to our OPD by his parents with chief complaint of weakness of all four limbs for the past 15 days. Weakness was acute in onset and progressively increasing. In addition to this, the patient had pain in upper back and neck with low-grade fever. There was no history of trauma or any other significant complaint. On physical examination, there was deep midline tenderness in cervical and upper dorsal region of spine. Neurologically, there was motor weakness in all four limbs, and sensations and sphincteric functions were intact. The patient was initially managed by absolute bed rest and supportive treatment. Subsequently, when he was evaluated, ESR and CRP both were raised. Radiograph of cervical spine showed straightening with maintained vertebral height and disc spaces. MRI was suggestive of spondylodiscitis along with phlegmonous soft tissue changes in pre- and para-vertebral region of cervico-dorsal spine extending from C3 to D3 vertebra (Figs. 1 and 2  ). Diagnosis of tuberculosis of cervico-dorsal spine was made on the basis of suggestive history, examination, and relevant investigation. One interesting finding we noticed in this patient was association of ptosis and miosis (Fig. 3 ) in left eye with on-going disease process. Enophthalmos and anhidrosis were not seen. Pupillary light reflex was present along with absent ciliospinal reflex. This led to our diagnosis of Horner's syndrome in left eye, which can be a complication of cervico-dorsal tuberculosis. The patient was managed with antitubercular chemotherapy and immobilization of spine using head halter traction. Neurological complications showed some improvement from 3rd week of treatment. At 4th week, traction was released and spine was immobilized on four post collar. At 3 months, there was complete improvement in motor weakness while ocular complication took longer time to recover. At 6 months, the patient showed complete improvement. ATT was continued for one and a half years. ",0

88,S2173579417302062,"Tuberculosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or both? A case report"," Clinic case report Female, 37, who visited due to periocular pain, red eye, edema and erythema of eyelids as well as proptosis in the left eye, with 3 weeks evolution. Previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed at another hospital 4 months earlier on the basis of clinic and compatible imaging confirmed with quantiferon test. The patient had been treated with a quadruple approach comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) during 3 months. At the visit, treatment consisted in rifampicin and isoniazid, which achieved complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. Ophthalmological examination produced a visual acuity of 20/20 in the right eye (RE) and 20/30 in the left eye (LE). The latter was outwardly and forwardly displaced. Hertel exophthalmometry was 12mm in the RE and 21mm in the LE with base in 104. The patient exhibited palpebral edema and erythema, conjunctival chemosis and hyperemia (Fig. 1A). LE ocular motility was moderately limited in all fields of gaze. No intraocular inflammation evidence was found while funduscopy and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. When questioned, the patient denied having other systemic symptoms. After suspecting orbital cellulitis, the patient was hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics without clinic improvement. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), requested upon admission of the patient, revealed a mass in the left orbit compromising the intra-and extra-conal compartments with apparent ethmoidal sinus compromise. The lesion exhibited moderate enhancement with gadolinium (Fig. 1B and C). Taking into account previous TB history, a chest X-ray was taken which showed pleural thickening with increased vascular pattern in the middle lobe of the right lung and inferior cavitations in the left lung (Fig. 2A). Hemogram showed anemia with 10.5g/dl hemoglobin and leukopenia of 3900cells/ml of leukocytes and platelets at 405,000cells/ml. C-reactive protein was positive at 1:160, with increased globular sedimentation velocity of 47mm/h. Creatinine clearing in 24-hour urine was slightly diminished at 51.8ml/min. ELISA test for HIV was negative. Test for hepatitis C, VDRL, FTA-ABS, rheumatoid factor and serum PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were likewise negative. Orbit biopsy was performed through anterior orbitotomy, which evidenced fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels with inflammatory infiltrates comprising lymphocytes, neutrophiles and some eosinophiles (Fig. 2B and C). With these findings, ANCA PR3 (c-ANCA) and MPO (p-ANCA) were analyzed, finding elevated levels of PR3 (c-ANCA) up to 59U/ml. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with GP. Treatment consisted in oral prednisone and 100mg/day cyclophosphamide during 10 months. Thereafter, treatment was switched to methotrexate which produced complete and sustained resolution of the orbit inflammation (Fig. 3A). Hertel exopthalmometry diminished to 17mm in the LE although ocular motility of this eye persisted with a limitation of ?1 for elevation and adduction, without subjective diplopia. Post-treatment orbital computerized tomography (CT) showed diminished mass in the orbit and proptosis. It also evidenced left rhinosinus disease (Fig. 3B and C). After 3 years of sustained remission, medical treatment was suspended. A few weeks later, the patient began to exhibit left diffuse anterior scleritis that resolved completely after medical treatment. Following this episode, immunosuppressant treatment was resumed. With a follow-up of 3 years, the patient remains stable and without vasculitis relapse in treatment with azathioprine and low dose of prednisone. ",0
89,S2211753916300598,Chronic Paracoccidioidomycosis with adrenal involvement mimicking tuberculosis – A case report from Austria," 2 Case A 62-year-old man was transferred from a community hospital to our department due to suspected diagnosis of reactivated tuberculosis of the lungs and adrenal glands in February 2015 (day 0). He reported left-sided chest and abdominal pain, weight loss of 12kg during the last 3 weeks as well as night sweats and cough. The punctum maximum of the abdominal pain was located at the left costal margin and aggravated at inspiration. Past medical history revealed several episodes of tuberculosis with involvement of the lungs, testes and adrenal glands ( Fig. 1). The patient reported that tuberculosis was diagnosed for the first time at the age of 7 years, followed by reactivations in the lungs with dissemination to the testes at the age of 14 and 21. Therefore, the patient had received tuberculostatic therapy, repeatedly. In 2010, he underwent CT-guided biopsy of a suspicious pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe and left adrenal gland due to considerable enlargement of adrenal glands. Based on the histopathological finding of epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis, the diagnosis of tuberculosis of lungs and adrenal glands was made. At that time, sputum smear, PCR and culture for acid fast bacilli were negative. Due to increasing size of the adrenal glands the patient underwent a second biopsy in the same hospital in 2012. Histopathological finding were similar to previous biopsy and again considered to be tuberculosis. From the year 1997 until 2001 he made yearly visits – each for several weeks - to a village in Regio de Pasco (Peru), a rural area located next to the rainforest of the Amazonas. He lived there in a house with a garden for approximately three years (2002–2004) and helped to construct a hospital. He did no agricultural or field work. During his stay in Peru he had no injury or disease worth mentioning. Except for two days in Arica (Chile) he did not visit any other South or Central American regions or countries. In addition, he reported that one day he recognized bats in the ceiling of his house and inhaled their excrements during cleaning. In addition to tuberculosis our patient had a past medical history of chronic bronchitis, Billroth II surgery due to peptic ulcer disease, cholecystectomy and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy approximately 10 years ago. The patient was a retired patient transport service driver in an Austrian hospital. Family history revealed a tuberculosis infection of his father. He was a current smoker with a history of 45 pack years, reported occasional alcohol consumption and no known allergies. He was on no chronic medication. Upon admission, the patient appeared in a good general condition with normal body temperature and a blood pressure of 120/70mmHg. Auscultation and percussion of lungs and heart were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft and showed periumbilical tenderness without resistance. Peripheral edema was not observed. Basic neurological examination and skin were unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with 78 beats per minute and no pathological findings. There was a mild eosinophilia (6%) and monocytosis (16%), but total white cell count (8.1G/l), hemoglobin (13.9g/dl), and platelet count (366G/l) were within normal limits. Levels of serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were normal. The concentration of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT, 193U/l), alkaline phosphatase (224U/l), and C-reactive protein (9.0mg/dl), plasma fibrinogen (560mg/dl), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 54/81mm) were elevated. Serum albumin (3.4g/dl) and sodium (135mmol/l) were slightly decreased while other electrolytes were normal. Myocardial biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin-T (hs-TnT), creatine kinase (CK) and muscle-brain type creatine kinase (CK-MB) were within normal range. Computed tomography (CT) showed postspecific pulmonary lesions. Compared to previous examinations, abdominal CT (day +0) revealed an increasing inhomogeneous enlargement of the adrenal glands (4.0×6.3cm) ( Fig. 2). Additionally, several enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenterial lymph nodes were found. Subsequently performed positron emission tomography (PET) (day +18) revealed an increased metabolic activity in bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands. Furthermore, hypermetabolic activity of cervical lymph nodes and the laryngeal area was found. Clinical and radiographic findings were suspicious for reactivation of tuberculosis. Interferon-gamma release assay (Quantiferon) (day +7) was positive but Ziehl-Neelsen smear, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of the sputum were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lues and adrenal autoantibodies were negative. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms such as tremor, disturbance of sensitivity and weakness of the extremities, triggered a neurological work-up. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (day +31) revealed a round temporo-parietal located lesion with perifocal edema, suspicious for infection or metastasis ( Fig. 3). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture (day +34) was unremarkable without any sign for infection, inflammation or neoplasm. Neurosurgeons did not consider surgical intervention. The cause of hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal enlargement remained unclear, initially. Tuberculosis was suspected but could not be confirmed by microbiology. Hence, CT guided biopsy of the left adrenal gland and extirpation of a right cervical lymph node (day +42) were performed for histopathological and microbiological work-up. Neither in the biopsy specimens of left adrenal gland nor the right cervical lymph node, Ziehl-Neelsen and PCR revealed any evidence for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (day +45). Serology for various systemic fungal infections and broad spectrum PCR from blood and aspirate fluids from biopsy (day +49) were negative as well. Histology of lymph node and left adrenal gland biopsy showed granulomas with central necrosis (day +48). In addition, in the left adrenal gland periodic acid–schiff (PAS), McManus, and methenamine silver stain (Grocott) revealed evidence of fungal pathogens. Giemsa stain of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen (day +49) showed characteristic yeast elements with multipolar budding of variable size thus indicating the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Fig. 4). Cultures of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen, were positive after incubation for 5 days (day +54) at 37°C and 28°C on Columbia agar (with 5% sheep blood; bioMérieux, Austria), 2% Sabouraud dextrose agar (Oxoid, Austria) and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI agar, Merck, Austria). Sequence analysis of the isolate confirmed the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sequence similarity was assessed by a search of homology not only with GenBank sequences, but also with the ISHAM ITS database. 100% identity was achieved with both databases (ISHAM identification number: MITS2102). Thus, we diagnosed paracoccidioidomycosis with dissemination to adrenal glands and highly suspicious involvement of cervical lymph nodes and the brain. When paracoccidioidomycosis was suspected, the specimen and all cultures were processed in a special laboratory for biosafety level 3 (S3-laboratory). This laboratory has all the equipment and safety features required for biosafety level 3 with controlled air flow and filtered ventilation systems. All personnel wore personal protective equipment (specialized clothing, gloves whenever handling the specimens or cultures). In accordance to this, personnel had the utmost protection against accidental infection. After identification of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antifungal treatment was initiated ( Table 1). In addition, replacement therapy with fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone was prescribed. Due to the evidence of cerebral involvement the patient was initially treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. The patient's general clinical condition improved and the antifungal therapy was switched to oral itraconazole. However, itraconazole never reached therapeutic level - neither with capsule nor liquid formulation, most probably due to the previous Billroth II resection. After deterioration of the patient and an increase in inflammatory parameters, liposomal amphotericin B was restarted. Associated with worsening of the systemic inflammation, hypotension, prerenal kidney failure and subsequent Addison crises occurred, so that hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone doses had to be adapted and high volume intravenous (IV) fluids substituted. Several ultrasound imaging studies showed a continuous decrease in size of the bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and a follow-up MRI of the brain revealed a shrinking size of the cerebral lesion. Overall clinical improvement was observed. After consultation of an infectious disease specialist, our patient was switched to oral posaconazole. Finally, the patient was discharged in a good general condition on oral posaconazole. ",0
90,S120197121834431X,First case of sexually transmitted asymptomatic female genital tuberculosis from spousal epididymal tuberculosis diagnosed by active screening," Case reports  Patient 1 (index case) A 54-year-old man noticed a swelling of the right epididymis approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. He was initially considered to have acute epididymitis. Although the causative organism could not be identified by urine testing, he was prescribed oral levofloxacin. The swelling of the epididymis recurred several times and was relieved by levofloxacin each time. However, approximately 1.5 years before the diagnosis, the left epididymis also started to swell gradually. A left orchiectomy was performed, because a tumor of the epididymis was suspected. Pathological findings of the resected testis revealed multinucleated giant cells and numerous caseous granulomas. He was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases because tuberculosis was highly suspected. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with epididymal tuberculosis based on urine PCR, urine culture, and histopathological findings. Additionally, a T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and HIV antibody test were both negative. Findings on chest computed tomography (CT) scan were unremarkable except for calcification of a mediastinal lymph node. He had been diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years earlier, which had been resected; there had been no recurrence at the time of presentation. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated was susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, levofloxacin, and streptomycin. Treatment was commenced with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a further 4 months.   Patient 2 (infected spouse) A 53-year-old woman visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Toranomon Hospital with her husband (patient 1) to inquire about the possibility of sexual transmission of tuberculosis approximately 1 month after his diagnosis. They were worried, although she looked healthy and had no symptoms: no fever, night sweats, weight loss, pelvic or abdominal pain, menstrual disorder, or respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and cough. She had been having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband once a week until 6 months before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. However, she had then refrained from sexual intercourse with her husband when they noticed the apparent swelling of his left epididymis because she was afraid of contracting a sexually transmitted infection from him. She had no past history of illnesses or operations, except for migraine at about 20 years of age and bilateral tubal ligation at about 35 years of age after the delivery of their third child. She reported having no other sexual partners after marriage. Finally, it was decided to perform active screening for genital tuberculosis even though she was asymptomatic. Laboratory findings of blood and urine testing were unremarkable. A T-SPOT.TB test and HIV antibody test were both negative. Chest and abdominal CT scans that included the pelvic area were unremarkable. Furthermore, a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound performed by a gynecologist were unremarkable except for a right ovarian cyst. A biopsy was not performed because no abnormal findings were observed in the endocervical canal or endometrium at that time. However, vaginal swab culture yielded M. tuberculosis and she was diagnosed with genital tuberculosis. Treatment for tuberculosis was started with the same regimen as that of her husband. Both M. tuberculosis isolates were sent to the Research Institute of Tuberculosis (Tokyo, Japan) for further analysis. Variable number tandem repeat analysis (VNTR, 24 loci) showed that the organisms from the two cases were identical (Iwamoto et al., 2012). Further analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS; MiSeq, Illumina) confirmed that the two isolates were genetically identical with only one nucleotide difference (Sekizuka et al., 2015).  ",0
92,S2214442014000941,Tuberculosis of the Spermatic Cord: Case Report," Case presentation A 44-year-old patient with no medical history of personal or family tuberculosis showed a 4-cm painful swelling on the right testicle, which had appeared 3 months earlier. The patient had not lost weight and showed no sign of infection. Testicle ultrasonography revealed an isoechoic, cylindrical, paratesticular structure, measuring 4 cm in its largest diameter. Routine blood and urine tests were within normal values with no inflammatory signs. Alpha Foetoprotein and beta Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin were normal. No tuberculosis skin test was performed. A surgery was performed, revealing an indurated right spermatic cord caught in a fibrous magma extending from the tail of the epididymis to the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 1 ). The fibrous cord was dissected and isolated from all the elements of the spermatic cord, with preservation of the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels. The testes were reinstated in purse. Histology showed on a 4 × 2 × 1 cm specimen, an epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomatous process with foci of caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). A checkup was made afterward revealing no other tuberculous location. The patient was given a 6-month antituberculous treatment: 2 (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol) + 4 (rifampicin + isoniazid) with a satisfying uneventful evolution. ",0
93,S1054880716300102,“Death at the wheel” due to tuberculosis of the myocardium: a case report," 2 Case report The body of a 35-year-old adult African male was admitted to our medicolegal mortuary, the deceased having been the driver of a motor vehicle that had apparently inexplicably veered off the road and collided with a tree at relatively low speed. No specific history of prior cardiac problems or other underlying medical conditions could be established. At autopsy, the deceased was well-nourished, measuring 1.8m in length and with a body mass of 108kg. There were no external injuries. Internal examination revealed a grossly enlarged heart with a mass of 540g, but with only modestly increased epicardial fat deposits. Further dissection revealed extensive, partially confluent yellow to white nodular infiltrates involving the walls of all cardiac chambers. The nodules varied from 5 to 15mm in diameter and had a firm, rubbery consistency (Fig. 1 ). Macroscopically, the lungs and kidneys showed no overt signs of disease, but sectioning of the spleen revealed multiple small white parenchymal nodules measuring 1–2mm in diameter, in keeping with miliary TB. Histological examination of the heart showed well-formed granulomas that were present in the full thickness of the myocardium on some of the sections. These granulomas consisted of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes and Langhans type as well as multinucleated giant cells with central areas of caseous necrosis. No eosinophils, Aschoff cells or asteroid bodies noted (Fig. 2 ). Histological examination of the kidneys showed no abnormalities with no granulomas present but histology of the lungs and spleen revealed a similar granulomatous inflammatory process as seen in the heart. The histological examination of the lung and spleen is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4  . However, multiple attempts at demonstrating acid-fast bacilli from several sites of the myocardium by using the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain were unsuccessful (Fig. 5 ). The PAS stain on the myocardial tissue was negative (Fig. 6 ). ZN staining of the lungs and spleen was also negative. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was further performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue but again a negative result ensued. Despite the negative outcome of the special investigations and based primarily on the macroscopic and histological findings, a final diagnosis of TB with involvement of the myocardium was made. ",0
96,S2173573516300151,Pharyngeal Tuberculosis: Report of 5 Cases," Methods This retrospective study from 2008 to 2010 presented the cases of patients with ENT primitive extranodal tuberculosis. Diagnosis was confirmed by anatomopathology and the clinical reports were collected and analysed by the Radiology Service. Initially, there were 15 cases of extranodal tuberculosis in the ENT region, but as the study was exclusively focused on the cavum, 10 cases were removed from our series. Data were classified according to the following criteria:  - Epidemiological: gender, age, vaccines, history of tuberculosis.   - Clinical symptoms: ENT symptoms, general health, fever, other tubercular location.   - Endoscopic: masses, ulcerations.   - Paraclinical: analytical, radiological, bacteriological in search of acid-fast resistant bacilli, by direct examination and by Lowenstein medium culture. Anatomopathological studies searching for Langhan cell granulomas with caseous necrosis.   - Therapeutic methods: medical and surgical.   - Evolution and prognosis.    ",0
97,S221255311600008X,Chronic oozing skin lesions in children: Possible tuberculosis? Two case reports," Case 2 A 5-year-old female presented with multiple swellings and discharging sinuses (oozing thick, whitish fluid) over the skin of the left upper part of the neck and submandibular area. The surrounding skin was purple-blue in color with elevated edges. Six months later, the patient developed two upper-left cervical swellings and one submandibular swelling that was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics with no response. These swellings began to open by fistula to the outer skin, oozing thick white fluid (Fig. 4 ). The patient had no history of chest disease and no chest symptoms, and no contact history with a TB-related case. Routine biochemical analysis, complete blood count, and urine analysis were all normal. ESR was 70 for the 1st hour, and the chest radiograph was normal. The tuberculin test was positive (induration 22mm×24mm), and a quantiferon TB gold test was positive. Gastric lavage was negative for mycobacteria. Swabs from the discharging fluid were sent for pyogenic culture and culture for acid-fast bacilli. A neck ultrasound revealed multiple bilateral-cervical, left-supraclavicular, and left-axillary lymph nodes (LNs) ranging from 1.4cm to 1.7cm. Some of the cervical and supraclavicular LNs were forming cystic turbid abscesses from 0.7cm to 2.3cm in size. Skin and LN biopsy was done, with the skin showing dense dermal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells and minimal epithelioid granulomata and sinus-tract formation. The LN architecture was mostly replaced with caseating epithelioid granuloma with few multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 5 ). Both patients received Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. A scar is now present at the site of injection. The patient had no history of previous pulmonary TB since birth, and developmental and family histories were unremarkable, with no family members having a history of TB. ",0
98,S2352621116000061,A case report of atypical sarcoidosis misdiagnosed as tuberculosis," 2 Case report A 49 years old, female patient was hospitalized for abdominal discomfort, low grade fever (with the highest body temperature to be 37.8 °C) and long time cough lasting for about half a month. The cough presented as irritating cough accompanied with nausea, but without phlegm and emesis. It is known that the patient is healthy ordinarily and no obvious inducement was found for these above mentioned symptoms. Therefore, a series of regular examinations were carried out, including laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, CT scanning, and biopsy and pathological diagnosis. The regular laboratory examination was showed in Table 1 . Additionally, plenty of lymphocytes and less mesothelial cells were detected in pleural effusions, without finding heterocyst. For the bronchoscopy, no obstruction was visible within the left principal bronchus and its branches. No hyperaemia, edema and erosion were found in the lumen mucous membrane. No stenosis and neoplasm were visible within the lumen. Mucous membrane was normal in the right upper lobe bronchus while mild hyperemia was found in the mucosa of right lower lobe bronchus, and the corresponding lumen showed with mild distortion and obvious neoplasm development. It was shown with bronchial ridge hypertrophy and enlargement. There was apparent stenosis in the lateral bronchus of the middle-lobe, showing with white moss-like secretions. The bronchial mucosa was a bit brittle and would bleed when touched. For regular CT examination, irregular pulmonary consolidation was presented in the middle and lower lobes around the right hilum, with mean CT value of 44HU; bronchus shadow with narrowed lumen was visible inside the lumen, and swelling lymph node shadow was likely to be visible in the mediastinum; and, a small amount of pleural effusion was presented in the right thorax, while no obvious abnormity was visible in the left one (Fig. 1 ). For the contrast enhanced CT scanning, equally enhancing lesions were presented inside the lung and around pulmonary hilus, with the mean CT value of 98HU during arterial phase (Fig. 2 A), and local stenosis occurred inside the pulmonary artery; by contrast, during the venous phase, the mean CT value was 98 HU (Fig. 2B); multiple lymphadenectasis presented as equal enhancements were found within the right pulmonary hilus and mediastinum (behind the left atrium), while multiple small nodular shadows were visible in the right pleura; and no obvious lymphadenectasis was presented in the left pulmonary hilus.  2.1 Biopsy and pathological examination Biopsy was carried out for the right pleura under thoracoscope, and it was shown that about 500 ml pale yellow effusion was presented in the right thorax, and there were also pleural edema, thickening and adhesion in the right chest. Unequal multiple small nodules with diameters from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm was found on the right side of the pleura, mediastinum, pericardium and pulmonary surface, and lump appeared around the right pulmonary hilus (Fig. 3 ). For further confirmation, the pathological diagnosis was carried out, which showed granulomatous inflammation accompanied with small necrosis, and the possibility of tuberculosis was not excluded. The results of acid fast stain were showed in Fig. 3. Ultrasonic bronchial endoscopy (Ebus) was carried out under general anesthesia, and the lymph node on the punctured right bronchus (region 4R) and subcarinal (region 7) lymph node were sent for biopsy, of which the results showed noncaseating granulomas (Fig. 4 ).

99,S2210261217301931,Ileocaecal and transverse colonic tuberculosis mimicking colonic malignancy – A case report," 2 Case presentation A 46year old female patient came walking to the outpatient department with a 6 month history of diffuse abdominal pain with low grade fever and loss of appetite and weight. No significant past medical or surgical history. There was no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On examination, general condition was fair, vitals were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a soft non tender abdomen with a normal digital per rectal examination. Haematological investigations were normal except erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) which was 80mm (0–30mm normal). Her serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA), cancer antigen19-9(CA 19-9) and serum adenosine deaminase(ADA) levels were within normal limits. Contrast enhanced CT(CECT) abdomen revealed a diffuse concentric long segmental circumferential wall thickening of terminal ileum, ileocaecal(IC) junction and ascending colon with peripheral fat stranding and lymphadenopathy with narrowing at the splenic flexure (Figs. 1–3   ). Colonoscopy showed an ulceronodular lesion with lumen compromise at the splenic flexure and thickening of the ileocaecal junction. Biopsy was taken from both the sites and sent for histopathological examination and also for culture and gene xpert for MTB. Pathology showed moderate mixed inflammation and occasional lymphoid collection in the lamina propria with no evidence of malignancy. There were also occasional crypt abscesses which raised suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. The final diagnosis of tuberculosis of the intestine was made as the biopsy smear showed AFBs and the Gene Xpert detected MTB. The patient was/started on Anti tubercular therapy. At 6 month follow up, patient is asymptomatic. Repeat CT scan shows no narrowing (Fig. 4 ). ",0
100,S1930043318302334,Pelvic tuberculosis: a forgotten diagnosis – case report," Case report An African14-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric disease department for investigation of an adnexal mass. Five months before admission, she immigrated to Portugal from Angola. One month after being in Portugal, she started feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, daily somnolence, and a persistent dry cough. She was medicated with an antihistaminic with some improvement of the cough. As the symptoms persisted, she had some laboratory tests, which showed microcytic hypochromic anemia that was medicated with iron replacement therapy. Two months later, she went to the emergency department due to aggravating symptoms, fever (of irregular pattern), weight loss (4 kg in 1 month), a low abdominal pain, and pain with inspiration in the right hemithorax. There was no associated past medical or surgical history and no history of recent disease in her family circle. She had no other signs or symptoms, namely, no menstrual disturbances (menarcha at 10 years), no urinary, respiratory (the cough subsided), or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination, a palpable painful hypogastric mass was found, hard on palpation and of irregular contours. A BCG vaccination scar was visible. She had an ultrasound (Fig. 1 ) that showed a large pelvic mass (about 12?×?8 cm), centered in the right adnexal area, predominantly cystic, complex, encapsulated, with multiple thin septa and a solid component that exhibited some vascularity in the Color Doppler study (Fig. 1b), creating a mass effect on the uterus and bladder. The left ovary was heterogeneous and mildly enlarged (not shown). There were associated terminal ileum, peritoneal thickening (Fig. 2 ), and mild ascitis. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR; Fig. 3 ) documented a complex cystic mass, apparently having its epicenter on the right adnexal area, with high signal in T2W sequences and intermediate-to-low signal in T1W sequence, with no saturation on fat-suppressed sequences. The multiple septa were thin, irregular, and had no definite enhancement on post gadolinium sequences. A solid enhancing component was not confirmed. Upon scrolling the sagittal images, the lesion suggested to be contiguous with the uterine horn and terminating at the right ovary, hence a hydropyosalpingitis was neither confirmed nor excluded. There was some distortion of ileal loops that were hard to characterize as they were retracted and adherent close together and in apposition with the mass. Despite this, the lesion seemed to be encapsulated and well defined. Some peritoneal enhancement was noted. No adenopathies were visible in the pelvis or in the lomboaortic chains. Chest radiograph (Fig. 4 a) revealed an obliteration of the right costophrenic angle extending upwards along the lateral wall, suggesting a loculated effusion. The corresponding chest ultrasound (Fig. 4b and c) exhibited a pleural effusionat the right lung base, anechogenic, with some thin septa, extending superiorly to the middle lung and causing passive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. Laboratory investigations elicited a normal leucogram and C-reactive protein (CRP), persistence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia (9.1 g/dL) and an elevated CA-125 (576 U/mL, normal values <35 U/mL). As an ovarian malignant tumor was suspected, she was submitted to an exploratory laparotomy with the intent of an eventual resection. A large right adnexal whitish mass was found, occupying the small pelvis, with an uninterrupted capsule, from which adhesions emanated to the bladder and ileon bowel walls, preventing it from resection. There was extensive perilesional inflammatory reaction, adherent to the peritoneal fat and lateral wall of the pelvic region, and multiple lesions with morphology suggestive of implants to the wall of the ileal loops in contact with the mass and in the peritoneum adjacent to the mass. The biopsy of the lesion revealed numerous granulomata with giant cells but no caseous necrosis and no evidence of neoplastic cells. Further laboratory testing revealed an elevated seric ADA (83 U/L, normal ranges being 4.8-23 U/L). As the results of the initial mass sample testing were nonspecific, she was submitted to an ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic lesion and a diagnostic thoracocentesis (also ultrasound guided). The tuberculin skin testing (TST/Mantoux) was marginally positive (13 mm). Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON testing was negative but further testing with IGRA T-SPOT was positive, substantiating the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis. Pleural liquid analysis revealed a very elevated LDH (1083 U/L, 5 times the normal seric value) and elevated ADA (188 U/L, normal being < 45 U/L), with normal leucocyte count. No BK was identified either by PCR or cultural exam. The mass aspirate was PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Almost 1 month later, cultural examination became positive for M. tuberculosis. She started antibacillary therapy with progressive symptomatic and overall improvement. After 8 months on combined antibacillary therapy, ultrasonography (Fig. 5 ) exhibited a residual complex cystic lesion in the right adnexal area, with some distortion of normal ovarian morphology. CA-125 returned to normal values. ",0
101,S193004331830339X,Rare radiological features of abdominopelvic tuberculosis: A case report," Case presentation A 26-year-old woman, para 1 lived 1, was referred to our medical center with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient noted that for the last 3 months she had been gradually experiencing intermittent vaginal bleeding, as well as progressive hypogastric and bilateral lower quadrants abdominal pain. The abdominal pain did not spread to any other spots and did not get relieved or aggravated by any factors. The patient noted that she had no history of any specific diseases. Furthermore, her menstrual cycles had always been regular and previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient also complained of weakness and 5 kg of weight loss (67–62 kg) in the past 3 months. The patient did not report the symptoms of urinary tract infection, coughing and sputum, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, recent travel, and history of any malignancies in her family. Upon examination, the blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg, temperature was 37.8?C, pulse rate was 88 bpm, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. There was a mild tenderness in both the lower quadrants without rebound tenderness. Her abdomen was mildly distended but the shifting dullness examination was negative and there were firm, mobile, and ill-defined edge masses in both lower quadrants. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography showed multicystic adnexal masses; because of the adhesions in the peritoneal cavity, it was impossible to identify peritoneal fluid collection from the cystic enlargement of the ovaries. For further evaluation, the abdominopelvic computed tomography scan was done which demonstrated a multicystic adnexal mass of 2.6?×?2.3 cm with an inaccurate site of origin and diffused nodular peritoneal and omental thickening (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's level of cancer antigen (CA), at 125, was more than the normal range (145 U/mL), but the alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotrophin levels were normal. Her chest X-ray was also normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a microcytic anemia, normal leukocyte count and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80 mm/hr). Laparotomy was performed on the patient due to the mass observed in the ovary and increased serum levels of CA-125 with the presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Lots of adhesions and ovaries covered with granulomatosis lesions were observed. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy were conducted and biopsies from the omentum and peritoneum were taken. Surgery was performed without any complications and no complications occurred postoperatively. Histopathology revealed that fragments of fibroconnective tissue contain numerous well-formed granulomas with extensive caseous necrosis, which was highly indicative of tuberculosis. After that, the result of acid-fast stains confirmed tuberculosis. After the diagnosis of tuberculosis, she underwent antituberculosis treatment.   ",0
103,S1054880715001210,Pancardiac tuberculosis — a case report," 2 Case history A 14-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with complaints of progressive dyspnea, chest pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss since 1 year. She weighed 27 kg for an expected weight of 41 kg. Her pulse was 90/min; respiratory rate was 16/min. There was bilateral pedal edema. Her hemoglobin was 9.4 gm%; total count was 6100/cm2 with 80% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes. Her liver function tests and renal function tests were in normal limits. X-ray chest was performed and showed cardiomegaly. However, there was no calcification noted in the pericardium. A 2D echo showed a thick pericardium about 10 mm, right atrial enlargement, and depressed left ventricular function; Left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] was 40% suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Her condition deteriorated, and she expired on the second day of hospital stay. A complete postmortem was performed. She was an averagely build and poorly nourished female. She had mild pallor and bilateral pedal edema. Examination of chest cavity showed 300-ml pleural effusion on right side. Both the lungs showed 1-mm pinhead sized tubercles on the pleural as well as the cut surface. Heart was enlarged, globular, and weighed 1440 g. Visceral and parietal pericardiums were thickened and opaque, adherent to each other and to the lungs and diaphragm suggestive of pericarditis (Fig. 1 ). On cut section, pericardium was 10-mm thick whitish opaque and firmly adherent to the myocardium. There were multiple diffused white nodular lesions with caseation seen in the pericardium, myocardium reaching up to the endocardium with focal ulceration of the endocardium (Figs. 2 and 3  ). All the chambers of the heart along with the interventricular septum showed involvement by similar lesions. Mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged and matted together; cut surface showed caseation. Spleen and liver also showed multiple miliary tubercles. Brain showed cerebral edema. All the rest of the organs were unremarkable. Histopathological examination of the heart showed extensive areas of caseation with epithelioid cells, Langhan's giant cells, and lymphocytesin in the pericardium, myocardium, and endocardium (Fig. 4 ). Epithelioid cell granulomas with and without caseation were seen in the mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, spleen, and liver. Acid fast bacilli [AFB] stain was done on the section of the heart which was positive for acid-fast bacilli. This case had disseminated tuberculosis with pan cardiac involvement. ",0
104,S1110663818300041,Isolated nasopharyngeal tuberculosis in a 12?year old boy – A case report," Case report A 12?year old boy presented with nasal obstruction since 8?months. He had presented with open mouth and snoring during sleep. Anterior rhinoscopic examination revealed middle turbinate hypertrophy and pale appearance of nasal septum. Diagnostic nasal endoscopic examination showed vegetative mass with smooth surface at the nasopharynx (Fig. 1 ). Rest of the ENT examinations and routine blood investigations were within normal limit. Sputum microscopy and culture were negative for acid fast bacilli whereas bacteriological examination from nasopharyngeal swab showed acid-fast bacilli and the quenching probe PCR test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no evidence of active pulmonary and systemic tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT scan) was done to rule out any mass and its extent at the nasopharynx. CT scan showed large mass occupying the nasopharynx (Fig. 2 ). A bit of tissue was taken from nasopharynx with help of endoscopy under local anesthesia and histopathological examination revealed caseous granulomatous lesion, non-necrotizing granuloma under the ciliated respiratory mucosa. The granulation tissue showed coagulation necrosis and Langerhans type of giant cells at the center (Fig. 3 ). No malignant cells were seen and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Patient was treated with antitubercular therapy (ATT) of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9?months. Patient was clinically improved in third month of treatment and the nasopharyngeal mass was resolved around 4th month months of ATT. ",0
105,S2214442018300810,A case report: Addison disease caused by adrenal tuberculosis," Case report A 43-year-old man was admitted for the evaluation of Addison's disease. He complain of depression, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, joint pain, skin hyper-pigmentation, nails, mouth and mucous membranes of the lips. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal and neurologic examination showed no abnormalities. Laboratory serum cortisol <0.05 ?gr/dl (Normal range: 3.09–16.6 ?g/dL). Investigation of the causes of this adrenal hipofunction due to tuberculosis by blood sedimentation rate, Mantoux test show negative results. Following to Interferon Gamma Release Assay, IGRA test also show negative results. Upper abdominal MRI shows bilateral adrenal (right AP 5.59 × LL 5.56 × CC 4.46 cm; left AP 4.74 × LL 4.12 × CC 5.66 cm) with regular edges, bilateral adrenal hypertrophy suspects with differential diagnosis of adrenal adenomas (see Fig. 1 ).

107,S2210261218302311,Rare case of sacrococcygeal tuberculosis mimicking as an anal fistula," 2 Presentation of case A 93-year-old Japanese man who presented with gluteal and coccygeal pain was referred to our hospital. Furthermore, discharging were observed in his fistula in the posterior peri-anal region. He had neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. He had history of pulmonary TB at 25 years of age, and underwent surgery for the removal of complex anal fistula at 75 years of age at another institution. Based on clinical examination, there were two fistulous orifices between the anus and coccyx with purulent discharge (Fig. 1 ). He did not present with cough, fever, weight loss, and anorexia. The chest radiograph result was normal, and hematologic examination showed no abnormalities, except for a slight elevation in C-reactive protein level. Fistulography showed a complex supra-elevator track that is connected to the pre-sacral area and another track ending blindly behind the rectum. The connection between the track and the rectum or anus was not identified on fistulography (Fig. 2 ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole body reveled a lytic destruction of the sacrum (S3-5) and coccyx, with a low-density area in front of the sacrum, suggesting fluid collection (Fig. 3 A). No abnormality was found in the lungs and other vertebrae on CT scan. Colonoscopy findings showed normal colorectal mucosa and no evidence of fistula. Based on these radiological findings and the past medical history of the patient, the recurrence of complex anal fistula with osteomyelitis, or metastatic bone tumor of unknown origin, was suspected. Bacterial examination of the fistula discharge showed normal bacterial culture and was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). However, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using COBAS TaqMan MTB test (Roche Molecular Systems, the USA) was used to test the cold abscess fluid, and results showed that the patient was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AFB test and PCR were negative for sputum. However, the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, the UK) blood test result was positive. Thus, the diagnosis of isolated sacrococcygeal TB was confirmed. The patient was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 7 months. The patient’s pain resolved, and the purulent drainage stopped within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on the physical findings, closure of the fistula was not achieved. However, the PCR test result for PCR DNA turned to be negative. A follow-up CT scan was carried out during treatment, and results showed that fluid collection in front of sacrum had disappeared (Fig. 3B). ",0
108,S120197121830047X,A case-report of a pulmonary tuberculosis with lymphadenopathy mimicking a lymphoma," Case report A 22-year-old Somalian male was referred to the Respiratory Diseases Unit of the university hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, in June 2016. He complained of thoracic pain during his stay in an immigrant reception center, without reporting fever, cough, or any clinically significant comorbidities. The physical examination showed enlarged, not movable, and tender latero-cervical lymph nodes, as well as crackles in the right emi-thorax. Chest X-ray showed a right middle lobe atelectasis and increased bronchovascular markings. Blood examinations showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6g/dl (suspected hypochromic and microcytic anemia), a white blood cell count of 3,930 cells/mm3 (55% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes, 2% eosinophils), and a platelet count of 311,000 cells/mm (Davies et al., 2008). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (6.24mg/dl and 113mm/h, respectively); gamma-globulins on electrophoresis were high but without any monoclonal spikes. His renal and liver function tests were within normal range. Total IgE were 4,820IU/ml. Albumin level was below the normal values (4.00g/dl). A chest CT scan (Figure 1 ) with contrast infusion showed a generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly in the following anatomical sites: latero-cervical (sized ?25–50mm), supraclavicular, subclavian, mediastinal, and sub-diaphragmatic. Para-tracheal, para-cardiac, and right hilar lymph nodes were confluent and enlarged (diameter size: ?30–50mm); furthermore, a right middle lobe collapse, a tree-in bud parenchymal infiltrate, and a right shift of trachea and its bifurcation were found. Spleen showed multiple and rounded lesions. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were smear- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only lymphocytes (CD3+ 90%, CD4+ 68% CD8+ 17%, CD4+/CD8+ 4) were found in the BAL cellular count. A trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the right para-tracheal lymph node was performed; however, the histological pattern was not specific (i.e., non-specific chronic inflammation). Ultrasound scans suggested a lymphoproliferative disorder based on the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, liver enlargement, and small, multiple spleen abscesses. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node. A chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells and central necrosis was found in the histopathological examination. Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott, and Ziehl-Nielsen stained slides did not show any abnormal findings. Immunohistochemistry did not detect tumor cellular markers (i.e., AE1/AE3, CD3, CD20). Based on the clinical features, an empirical anti-TB treatment was started (ethambutol 1.2g/day, isoniazid 300mg/day, rifampicin 600mg/day, pyrazinamide 1.5g/day). However, his clinical conditions rapidly worsened (abdominal pain, vomit, fever, dehydration, elevated liver transaminases levels). One week after TB treatment initiation a left pleural effusion occurred (then, classified as TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). A sample of 2,000ml of pleuritic liquid was collected: it was limpid yellowish, with LDH level of 369U/L, total protein of 4.7g/dl, glucose of 60mg/dl, and PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After 47 days, a BAL culture conversion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurred. The drug susceptibility pattern did not show any drug resistances (i.e., isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Patient was discharged from hospital and underwent a new chest CT scan (Figure 1) after 6 months of treatment. It found an improvement of the atelectasis of the right middle lobe, and a decreased size of the subcarinal, right hilar, and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes. ",0
109,S1201971218345211,The use of bedaquiline to treat patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and end-stage renal disease: A case report," Case reports  Patient 1 In August 2016, a 46-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of pre-extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Two months before that visit, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary and peritoneal TB and had commenced first-line drugs. Subsequent phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) revealed pre-XDR-TB, after which he was transferred to our hospital (Table 1 ). The patient exhibited hypertension and ESRD (anuria requiring conventional hemodialysis three times weekly). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Baseline serum creatinine levels were 8.12mg/dl pre-hemodialysis and 3.97mg/dl post-hemodialysis. The baseline QTcF interval was 441ms on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, amikacin, moxifloxacin, cycloserine, linezolid, and bedaquiline after obtaining informed consent. Bedaquiline was started at 200mg three times weekly and was given for 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse reaction related to bedaquiline was encountered. One year after treatment initiation, amikacin and linezolid were permanently discontinued because of a hearing disturbance and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In April 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 607 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire course of treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 469ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.   Patient 2 In September 2016, a 53-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of MDR-TB. He had taken first-line drugs in 2013 and 2014 to treat drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Three months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB once more and placed on first-line drugs. Subsequent DST revealed MDR-TB, and he was then transferred to our hospital (Table 1). The patient exhibited hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C virus infection, and chronic kidney disease (average urine volume 1500ml/day without a requirement for maintenance renal replacement therapy). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for M. tuberculosis were negative. The baseline serum creatinine level was 3.04mg/dl (the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 21.7ml/min/1.73m2). The baseline QTcF interval was 424ms on ECG monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, amikacin, prothionamide, and cycloserine. Unfortunately, acute kidney injury developed 6 days later (the serum creatinine level increased to 5.1mg/dl, combined with oliguria), and amikacin was thus discontinued permanently. After 2 months, bedaquiline was added to the treatment regimen after obtaining informed consent. (Due to administrative issues, bedaquiline could not be started immediately after discontinuing the amikacin.) Bedaquiline was commenced at 400mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200mg three times weekly. In February 2017 (5 months after treatment commencement and 3 months after the addition of bedaquiline), the patient started conventional maintenance hemodialysis (three times weekly) because renal impairment had progressed. Bedaquiline treatment was continued unchanged for a total of 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse drug reaction related to bedaquiline was observed. Five months after treatment initiation, pyrazinamide was replaced by para-aminosalicylic acid because the patient developed gout. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In June 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 653 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 463ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.  ",0
110,S1413867015002147,Oral manifestation of tuberculosis: a case-report," Case-report A 61-year-old male patient with a history of smoking habit and alcohol abuse was being followed up for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy associated with vasculopathy, systemic hypertension, and chronic pancreatitis in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The patient was referred to the Stomatology Unit of the same hospital due to the emergence of lesions on the oral mucosa. Preliminary examination revealed two lesions, each measuring approximately 10mm across and presenting a granulomatous central portion and whitish halo. The lesions were located on the upper lip mucosa near the median line and on the left jugal mucosa adjacent to the labial anterior commissure (Fig. 1A and B, respectively). The patient complained of pain, productive cough for the past 15 days, night sweats, episodic fever in the morning, and slight weight loss in the previous two months. However, these complaints were intermittently made by the patient along the scheduled appointments, which may have added to the difficulty for an early diagnosis of the disease. Samples of lesions were collected by incision and stained according to the hematoxylin–eosin (HE) and Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocols. The pathological report was negative for the presence of alcohol–acid resistant microorganisms (Fig. 2 ). Due to the comparatively low count of microorganisms in the tissues analyzed, the special staining used did not successfully detect the presence of the bacterium. However, since a negative result in this kind of analysis does not rule out TB, a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage was analyzed according to the Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocol, with a positive result for M. tuberculosis. A radiograph of the thorax was suggestive of presence of active infectious disease, manifested as budding tree-like centrilobular nodules in both lungs, especially on the right. In this case report, the pathological analysis of the samples collected from the patient was not conclusive, requiring a Mantoux assay and the investigation of bronchoalveolar lavage in order to confirm the TB suspicion. The Mantoux protocol indicated a 13-mm inflammatory reaction confirming TB. Anti-HIV test was negative. The patient was referred to a pulmonologist for examination and treatment based on the pulmonary extension of the disease (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, 30 days into the treatment the patient died due to the worsening of clinical conditions, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney failure. ",0
111,S0976566216000412,Horner's syndrome in cervico-dorsal tuberculosis: A rare case report," 2 Case report A 6-year-old male child was brought to our OPD by his parents with chief complaint of weakness of all four limbs for the past 15 days. Weakness was acute in onset and progressively increasing. In addition to this, the patient had pain in upper back and neck with low-grade fever. There was no history of trauma or any other significant complaint. On physical examination, there was deep midline tenderness in cervical and upper dorsal region of spine. Neurologically, there was motor weakness in all four limbs, and sensations and sphincteric functions were intact. The patient was initially managed by absolute bed rest and supportive treatment. Subsequently, when he was evaluated, ESR and CRP both were raised. Radiograph of cervical spine showed straightening with maintained vertebral height and disc spaces. MRI was suggestive of spondylodiscitis along with phlegmonous soft tissue changes in pre- and para-vertebral region of cervico-dorsal spine extending from C3 to D3 vertebra (Figs. 1 and 2  ). Diagnosis of tuberculosis of cervico-dorsal spine was made on the basis of suggestive history, examination, and relevant investigation. One interesting finding we noticed in this patient was association of ptosis and miosis (Fig. 3 ) in left eye with on-going disease process. Enophthalmos and anhidrosis were not seen. Pupillary light reflex was present along with absent ciliospinal reflex. This led to our diagnosis of Horner's syndrome in left eye, which can be a complication of cervico-dorsal tuberculosis. The patient was managed with antitubercular chemotherapy and immobilization of spine using head halter traction. Neurological complications showed some improvement from 3rd week of treatment. At 4th week, traction was released and spine was immobilized on four post collar. At 3 months, there was complete improvement in motor weakness while ocular complication took longer time to recover. At 6 months, the patient showed complete improvement. ATT was continued for one and a half years. ",0

113,S2173579417302062,"Tuberculosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or both? A case report"," Clinic case report Female, 37, who visited due to periocular pain, red eye, edema and erythema of eyelids as well as proptosis in the left eye, with 3 weeks evolution. Previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed at another hospital 4 months earlier on the basis of clinic and compatible imaging confirmed with quantiferon test. The patient had been treated with a quadruple approach comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) during 3 months. At the visit, treatment consisted in rifampicin and isoniazid, which achieved complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. Ophthalmological examination produced a visual acuity of 20/20 in the right eye (RE) and 20/30 in the left eye (LE). The latter was outwardly and forwardly displaced. Hertel exophthalmometry was 12mm in the RE and 21mm in the LE with base in 104. The patient exhibited palpebral edema and erythema, conjunctival chemosis and hyperemia (Fig. 1A). LE ocular motility was moderately limited in all fields of gaze. No intraocular inflammation evidence was found while funduscopy and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. When questioned, the patient denied having other systemic symptoms. After suspecting orbital cellulitis, the patient was hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics without clinic improvement. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), requested upon admission of the patient, revealed a mass in the left orbit compromising the intra-and extra-conal compartments with apparent ethmoidal sinus compromise. The lesion exhibited moderate enhancement with gadolinium (Fig. 1B and C). Taking into account previous TB history, a chest X-ray was taken which showed pleural thickening with increased vascular pattern in the middle lobe of the right lung and inferior cavitations in the left lung (Fig. 2A). Hemogram showed anemia with 10.5g/dl hemoglobin and leukopenia of 3900cells/ml of leukocytes and platelets at 405,000cells/ml. C-reactive protein was positive at 1:160, with increased globular sedimentation velocity of 47mm/h. Creatinine clearing in 24-hour urine was slightly diminished at 51.8ml/min. ELISA test for HIV was negative. Test for hepatitis C, VDRL, FTA-ABS, rheumatoid factor and serum PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were likewise negative. Orbit biopsy was performed through anterior orbitotomy, which evidenced fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels with inflammatory infiltrates comprising lymphocytes, neutrophiles and some eosinophiles (Fig. 2B and C). With these findings, ANCA PR3 (c-ANCA) and MPO (p-ANCA) were analyzed, finding elevated levels of PR3 (c-ANCA) up to 59U/ml. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with GP. Treatment consisted in oral prednisone and 100mg/day cyclophosphamide during 10 months. Thereafter, treatment was switched to methotrexate which produced complete and sustained resolution of the orbit inflammation (Fig. 3A). Hertel exopthalmometry diminished to 17mm in the LE although ocular motility of this eye persisted with a limitation of ?1 for elevation and adduction, without subjective diplopia. Post-treatment orbital computerized tomography (CT) showed diminished mass in the orbit and proptosis. It also evidenced left rhinosinus disease (Fig. 3B and C). After 3 years of sustained remission, medical treatment was suspended. A few weeks later, the patient began to exhibit left diffuse anterior scleritis that resolved completely after medical treatment. Following this episode, immunosuppressant treatment was resumed. With a follow-up of 3 years, the patient remains stable and without vasculitis relapse in treatment with azathioprine and low dose of prednisone. ",0
114,S2211753916300598,Chronic Paracoccidioidomycosis with adrenal involvement mimicking tuberculosis – A case report from Austria," 2 Case A 62-year-old man was transferred from a community hospital to our department due to suspected diagnosis of reactivated tuberculosis of the lungs and adrenal glands in February 2015 (day 0). He reported left-sided chest and abdominal pain, weight loss of 12kg during the last 3 weeks as well as night sweats and cough. The punctum maximum of the abdominal pain was located at the left costal margin and aggravated at inspiration. Past medical history revealed several episodes of tuberculosis with involvement of the lungs, testes and adrenal glands ( Fig. 1). The patient reported that tuberculosis was diagnosed for the first time at the age of 7 years, followed by reactivations in the lungs with dissemination to the testes at the age of 14 and 21. Therefore, the patient had received tuberculostatic therapy, repeatedly. In 2010, he underwent CT-guided biopsy of a suspicious pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe and left adrenal gland due to considerable enlargement of adrenal glands. Based on the histopathological finding of epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis, the diagnosis of tuberculosis of lungs and adrenal glands was made. At that time, sputum smear, PCR and culture for acid fast bacilli were negative. Due to increasing size of the adrenal glands the patient underwent a second biopsy in the same hospital in 2012. Histopathological finding were similar to previous biopsy and again considered to be tuberculosis. From the year 1997 until 2001 he made yearly visits – each for several weeks - to a village in Regio de Pasco (Peru), a rural area located next to the rainforest of the Amazonas. He lived there in a house with a garden for approximately three years (2002–2004) and helped to construct a hospital. He did no agricultural or field work. During his stay in Peru he had no injury or disease worth mentioning. Except for two days in Arica (Chile) he did not visit any other South or Central American regions or countries. In addition, he reported that one day he recognized bats in the ceiling of his house and inhaled their excrements during cleaning. In addition to tuberculosis our patient had a past medical history of chronic bronchitis, Billroth II surgery due to peptic ulcer disease, cholecystectomy and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy approximately 10 years ago. The patient was a retired patient transport service driver in an Austrian hospital. Family history revealed a tuberculosis infection of his father. He was a current smoker with a history of 45 pack years, reported occasional alcohol consumption and no known allergies. He was on no chronic medication. Upon admission, the patient appeared in a good general condition with normal body temperature and a blood pressure of 120/70mmHg. Auscultation and percussion of lungs and heart were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft and showed periumbilical tenderness without resistance. Peripheral edema was not observed. Basic neurological examination and skin were unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with 78 beats per minute and no pathological findings. There was a mild eosinophilia (6%) and monocytosis (16%), but total white cell count (8.1G/l), hemoglobin (13.9g/dl), and platelet count (366G/l) were within normal limits. Levels of serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were normal. The concentration of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT, 193U/l), alkaline phosphatase (224U/l), and C-reactive protein (9.0mg/dl), plasma fibrinogen (560mg/dl), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 54/81mm) were elevated. Serum albumin (3.4g/dl) and sodium (135mmol/l) were slightly decreased while other electrolytes were normal. Myocardial biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin-T (hs-TnT), creatine kinase (CK) and muscle-brain type creatine kinase (CK-MB) were within normal range. Computed tomography (CT) showed postspecific pulmonary lesions. Compared to previous examinations, abdominal CT (day +0) revealed an increasing inhomogeneous enlargement of the adrenal glands (4.0×6.3cm) ( Fig. 2). Additionally, several enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenterial lymph nodes were found. Subsequently performed positron emission tomography (PET) (day +18) revealed an increased metabolic activity in bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands. Furthermore, hypermetabolic activity of cervical lymph nodes and the laryngeal area was found. Clinical and radiographic findings were suspicious for reactivation of tuberculosis. Interferon-gamma release assay (Quantiferon) (day +7) was positive but Ziehl-Neelsen smear, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of the sputum were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lues and adrenal autoantibodies were negative. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms such as tremor, disturbance of sensitivity and weakness of the extremities, triggered a neurological work-up. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (day +31) revealed a round temporo-parietal located lesion with perifocal edema, suspicious for infection or metastasis ( Fig. 3). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture (day +34) was unremarkable without any sign for infection, inflammation or neoplasm. Neurosurgeons did not consider surgical intervention. The cause of hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal enlargement remained unclear, initially. Tuberculosis was suspected but could not be confirmed by microbiology. Hence, CT guided biopsy of the left adrenal gland and extirpation of a right cervical lymph node (day +42) were performed for histopathological and microbiological work-up. Neither in the biopsy specimens of left adrenal gland nor the right cervical lymph node, Ziehl-Neelsen and PCR revealed any evidence for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (day +45). Serology for various systemic fungal infections and broad spectrum PCR from blood and aspirate fluids from biopsy (day +49) were negative as well. Histology of lymph node and left adrenal gland biopsy showed granulomas with central necrosis (day +48). In addition, in the left adrenal gland periodic acid–schiff (PAS), McManus, and methenamine silver stain (Grocott) revealed evidence of fungal pathogens. Giemsa stain of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen (day +49) showed characteristic yeast elements with multipolar budding of variable size thus indicating the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Fig. 4). Cultures of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen, were positive after incubation for 5 days (day +54) at 37°C and 28°C on Columbia agar (with 5% sheep blood; bioMérieux, Austria), 2% Sabouraud dextrose agar (Oxoid, Austria) and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI agar, Merck, Austria). Sequence analysis of the isolate confirmed the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sequence similarity was assessed by a search of homology not only with GenBank sequences, but also with the ISHAM ITS database. 100% identity was achieved with both databases (ISHAM identification number: MITS2102). Thus, we diagnosed paracoccidioidomycosis with dissemination to adrenal glands and highly suspicious involvement of cervical lymph nodes and the brain. When paracoccidioidomycosis was suspected, the specimen and all cultures were processed in a special laboratory for biosafety level 3 (S3-laboratory). This laboratory has all the equipment and safety features required for biosafety level 3 with controlled air flow and filtered ventilation systems. All personnel wore personal protective equipment (specialized clothing, gloves whenever handling the specimens or cultures). In accordance to this, personnel had the utmost protection against accidental infection. After identification of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antifungal treatment was initiated ( Table 1). In addition, replacement therapy with fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone was prescribed. Due to the evidence of cerebral involvement the patient was initially treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. The patient's general clinical condition improved and the antifungal therapy was switched to oral itraconazole. However, itraconazole never reached therapeutic level - neither with capsule nor liquid formulation, most probably due to the previous Billroth II resection. After deterioration of the patient and an increase in inflammatory parameters, liposomal amphotericin B was restarted. Associated with worsening of the systemic inflammation, hypotension, prerenal kidney failure and subsequent Addison crises occurred, so that hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone doses had to be adapted and high volume intravenous (IV) fluids substituted. Several ultrasound imaging studies showed a continuous decrease in size of the bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and a follow-up MRI of the brain revealed a shrinking size of the cerebral lesion. Overall clinical improvement was observed. After consultation of an infectious disease specialist, our patient was switched to oral posaconazole. Finally, the patient was discharged in a good general condition on oral posaconazole. ",0
115,S120197121834431X,First case of sexually transmitted asymptomatic female genital tuberculosis from spousal epididymal tuberculosis diagnosed by active screening," Case reports  Patient 1 (index case) A 54-year-old man noticed a swelling of the right epididymis approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. He was initially considered to have acute epididymitis. Although the causative organism could not be identified by urine testing, he was prescribed oral levofloxacin. The swelling of the epididymis recurred several times and was relieved by levofloxacin each time. However, approximately 1.5 years before the diagnosis, the left epididymis also started to swell gradually. A left orchiectomy was performed, because a tumor of the epididymis was suspected. Pathological findings of the resected testis revealed multinucleated giant cells and numerous caseous granulomas. He was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases because tuberculosis was highly suspected. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with epididymal tuberculosis based on urine PCR, urine culture, and histopathological findings. Additionally, a T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and HIV antibody test were both negative. Findings on chest computed tomography (CT) scan were unremarkable except for calcification of a mediastinal lymph node. He had been diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years earlier, which had been resected; there had been no recurrence at the time of presentation. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated was susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, levofloxacin, and streptomycin. Treatment was commenced with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a further 4 months.   Patient 2 (infected spouse) A 53-year-old woman visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Toranomon Hospital with her husband (patient 1) to inquire about the possibility of sexual transmission of tuberculosis approximately 1 month after his diagnosis. They were worried, although she looked healthy and had no symptoms: no fever, night sweats, weight loss, pelvic or abdominal pain, menstrual disorder, or respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and cough. She had been having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband once a week until 6 months before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. However, she had then refrained from sexual intercourse with her husband when they noticed the apparent swelling of his left epididymis because she was afraid of contracting a sexually transmitted infection from him. She had no past history of illnesses or operations, except for migraine at about 20 years of age and bilateral tubal ligation at about 35 years of age after the delivery of their third child. She reported having no other sexual partners after marriage. Finally, it was decided to perform active screening for genital tuberculosis even though she was asymptomatic. Laboratory findings of blood and urine testing were unremarkable. A T-SPOT.TB test and HIV antibody test were both negative. Chest and abdominal CT scans that included the pelvic area were unremarkable. Furthermore, a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound performed by a gynecologist were unremarkable except for a right ovarian cyst. A biopsy was not performed because no abnormal findings were observed in the endocervical canal or endometrium at that time. However, vaginal swab culture yielded M. tuberculosis and she was diagnosed with genital tuberculosis. Treatment for tuberculosis was started with the same regimen as that of her husband. Both M. tuberculosis isolates were sent to the Research Institute of Tuberculosis (Tokyo, Japan) for further analysis. Variable number tandem repeat analysis (VNTR, 24 loci) showed that the organisms from the two cases were identical (Iwamoto et al., 2012). Further analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS; MiSeq, Illumina) confirmed that the two isolates were genetically identical with only one nucleotide difference (Sekizuka et al., 2015).  ",0
117,S2214442014000941,Tuberculosis of the Spermatic Cord: Case Report," Case presentation A 44-year-old patient with no medical history of personal or family tuberculosis showed a 4-cm painful swelling on the right testicle, which had appeared 3 months earlier. The patient had not lost weight and showed no sign of infection. Testicle ultrasonography revealed an isoechoic, cylindrical, paratesticular structure, measuring 4 cm in its largest diameter. Routine blood and urine tests were within normal values with no inflammatory signs. Alpha Foetoprotein and beta Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin were normal. No tuberculosis skin test was performed. A surgery was performed, revealing an indurated right spermatic cord caught in a fibrous magma extending from the tail of the epididymis to the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 1 ). The fibrous cord was dissected and isolated from all the elements of the spermatic cord, with preservation of the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels. The testes were reinstated in purse. Histology showed on a 4 × 2 × 1 cm specimen, an epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomatous process with foci of caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). A checkup was made afterward revealing no other tuberculous location. The patient was given a 6-month antituberculous treatment: 2 (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol) + 4 (rifampicin + isoniazid) with a satisfying uneventful evolution. ",0
118,S1054880716300102,“Death at the wheel” due to tuberculosis of the myocardium: a case report," 2 Case report The body of a 35-year-old adult African male was admitted to our medicolegal mortuary, the deceased having been the driver of a motor vehicle that had apparently inexplicably veered off the road and collided with a tree at relatively low speed. No specific history of prior cardiac problems or other underlying medical conditions could be established. At autopsy, the deceased was well-nourished, measuring 1.8m in length and with a body mass of 108kg. There were no external injuries. Internal examination revealed a grossly enlarged heart with a mass of 540g, but with only modestly increased epicardial fat deposits. Further dissection revealed extensive, partially confluent yellow to white nodular infiltrates involving the walls of all cardiac chambers. The nodules varied from 5 to 15mm in diameter and had a firm, rubbery consistency (Fig. 1 ). Macroscopically, the lungs and kidneys showed no overt signs of disease, but sectioning of the spleen revealed multiple small white parenchymal nodules measuring 1–2mm in diameter, in keeping with miliary TB. Histological examination of the heart showed well-formed granulomas that were present in the full thickness of the myocardium on some of the sections. These granulomas consisted of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes and Langhans type as well as multinucleated giant cells with central areas of caseous necrosis. No eosinophils, Aschoff cells or asteroid bodies noted (Fig. 2 ). Histological examination of the kidneys showed no abnormalities with no granulomas present but histology of the lungs and spleen revealed a similar granulomatous inflammatory process as seen in the heart. The histological examination of the lung and spleen is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4  . However, multiple attempts at demonstrating acid-fast bacilli from several sites of the myocardium by using the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain were unsuccessful (Fig. 5 ). The PAS stain on the myocardial tissue was negative (Fig. 6 ). ZN staining of the lungs and spleen was also negative. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was further performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue but again a negative result ensued. Despite the negative outcome of the special investigations and based primarily on the macroscopic and histological findings, a final diagnosis of TB with involvement of the myocardium was made. ",0
121,S2173573516300151,Pharyngeal Tuberculosis: Report of 5 Cases," Methods This retrospective study from 2008 to 2010 presented the cases of patients with ENT primitive extranodal tuberculosis. Diagnosis was confirmed by anatomopathology and the clinical reports were collected and analysed by the Radiology Service. Initially, there were 15 cases of extranodal tuberculosis in the ENT region, but as the study was exclusively focused on the cavum, 10 cases were removed from our series. Data were classified according to the following criteria:  - Epidemiological: gender, age, vaccines, history of tuberculosis.   - Clinical symptoms: ENT symptoms, general health, fever, other tubercular location.   - Endoscopic: masses, ulcerations.   - Paraclinical: analytical, radiological, bacteriological in search of acid-fast resistant bacilli, by direct examination and by Lowenstein medium culture. Anatomopathological studies searching for Langhan cell granulomas with caseous necrosis.   - Therapeutic methods: medical and surgical.   - Evolution and prognosis.    ",0
122,S221255311600008X,Chronic oozing skin lesions in children: Possible tuberculosis? Two case reports," Case 2 A 5-year-old female presented with multiple swellings and discharging sinuses (oozing thick, whitish fluid) over the skin of the left upper part of the neck and submandibular area. The surrounding skin was purple-blue in color with elevated edges. Six months later, the patient developed two upper-left cervical swellings and one submandibular swelling that was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics with no response. These swellings began to open by fistula to the outer skin, oozing thick white fluid (Fig. 4 ). The patient had no history of chest disease and no chest symptoms, and no contact history with a TB-related case. Routine biochemical analysis, complete blood count, and urine analysis were all normal. ESR was 70 for the 1st hour, and the chest radiograph was normal. The tuberculin test was positive (induration 22mm×24mm), and a quantiferon TB gold test was positive. Gastric lavage was negative for mycobacteria. Swabs from the discharging fluid were sent for pyogenic culture and culture for acid-fast bacilli. A neck ultrasound revealed multiple bilateral-cervical, left-supraclavicular, and left-axillary lymph nodes (LNs) ranging from 1.4cm to 1.7cm. Some of the cervical and supraclavicular LNs were forming cystic turbid abscesses from 0.7cm to 2.3cm in size. Skin and LN biopsy was done, with the skin showing dense dermal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells and minimal epithelioid granulomata and sinus-tract formation. The LN architecture was mostly replaced with caseating epithelioid granuloma with few multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 5 ). Both patients received Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. A scar is now present at the site of injection. The patient had no history of previous pulmonary TB since birth, and developmental and family histories were unremarkable, with no family members having a history of TB. ",0
123,S2352621116000061,A case report of atypical sarcoidosis misdiagnosed as tuberculosis," 2 Case report A 49 years old, female patient was hospitalized for abdominal discomfort, low grade fever (with the highest body temperature to be 37.8 °C) and long time cough lasting for about half a month. The cough presented as irritating cough accompanied with nausea, but without phlegm and emesis. It is known that the patient is healthy ordinarily and no obvious inducement was found for these above mentioned symptoms. Therefore, a series of regular examinations were carried out, including laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, CT scanning, and biopsy and pathological diagnosis. The regular laboratory examination was showed in Table 1 . Additionally, plenty of lymphocytes and less mesothelial cells were detected in pleural effusions, without finding heterocyst. For the bronchoscopy, no obstruction was visible within the left principal bronchus and its branches. No hyperaemia, edema and erosion were found in the lumen mucous membrane. No stenosis and neoplasm were visible within the lumen. Mucous membrane was normal in the right upper lobe bronchus while mild hyperemia was found in the mucosa of right lower lobe bronchus, and the corresponding lumen showed with mild distortion and obvious neoplasm development. It was shown with bronchial ridge hypertrophy and enlargement. There was apparent stenosis in the lateral bronchus of the middle-lobe, showing with white moss-like secretions. The bronchial mucosa was a bit brittle and would bleed when touched. For regular CT examination, irregular pulmonary consolidation was presented in the middle and lower lobes around the right hilum, with mean CT value of 44HU; bronchus shadow with narrowed lumen was visible inside the lumen, and swelling lymph node shadow was likely to be visible in the mediastinum; and, a small amount of pleural effusion was presented in the right thorax, while no obvious abnormity was visible in the left one (Fig. 1 ). For the contrast enhanced CT scanning, equally enhancing lesions were presented inside the lung and around pulmonary hilus, with the mean CT value of 98HU during arterial phase (Fig. 2 A), and local stenosis occurred inside the pulmonary artery; by contrast, during the venous phase, the mean CT value was 98 HU (Fig. 2B); multiple lymphadenectasis presented as equal enhancements were found within the right pulmonary hilus and mediastinum (behind the left atrium), while multiple small nodular shadows were visible in the right pleura; and no obvious lymphadenectasis was presented in the left pulmonary hilus.  2.1 Biopsy and pathological examination Biopsy was carried out for the right pleura under thoracoscope, and it was shown that about 500 ml pale yellow effusion was presented in the right thorax, and there were also pleural edema, thickening and adhesion in the right chest. Unequal multiple small nodules with diameters from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm was found on the right side of the pleura, mediastinum, pericardium and pulmonary surface, and lump appeared around the right pulmonary hilus (Fig. 3 ). For further confirmation, the pathological diagnosis was carried out, which showed granulomatous inflammation accompanied with small necrosis, and the possibility of tuberculosis was not excluded. The results of acid fast stain were showed in Fig. 3. Ultrasonic bronchial endoscopy (Ebus) was carried out under general anesthesia, and the lymph node on the punctured right bronchus (region 4R) and subcarinal (region 7) lymph node were sent for biopsy, of which the results showed noncaseating granulomas (Fig. 4 ).

124,S2210261217301931,Ileocaecal and transverse colonic tuberculosis mimicking colonic malignancy – A case report," 2 Case presentation A 46year old female patient came walking to the outpatient department with a 6 month history of diffuse abdominal pain with low grade fever and loss of appetite and weight. No significant past medical or surgical history. There was no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On examination, general condition was fair, vitals were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a soft non tender abdomen with a normal digital per rectal examination. Haematological investigations were normal except erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) which was 80mm (0–30mm normal). Her serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA), cancer antigen19-9(CA 19-9) and serum adenosine deaminase(ADA) levels were within normal limits. Contrast enhanced CT(CECT) abdomen revealed a diffuse concentric long segmental circumferential wall thickening of terminal ileum, ileocaecal(IC) junction and ascending colon with peripheral fat stranding and lymphadenopathy with narrowing at the splenic flexure (Figs. 1–3   ). Colonoscopy showed an ulceronodular lesion with lumen compromise at the splenic flexure and thickening of the ileocaecal junction. Biopsy was taken from both the sites and sent for histopathological examination and also for culture and gene xpert for MTB. Pathology showed moderate mixed inflammation and occasional lymphoid collection in the lamina propria with no evidence of malignancy. There were also occasional crypt abscesses which raised suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. The final diagnosis of tuberculosis of the intestine was made as the biopsy smear showed AFBs and the Gene Xpert detected MTB. The patient was/started on Anti tubercular therapy. At 6 month follow up, patient is asymptomatic. Repeat CT scan shows no narrowing (Fig. 4 ). ",0
125,S1930043318302334,Pelvic tuberculosis: a forgotten diagnosis – case report," Case report An African14-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric disease department for investigation of an adnexal mass. Five months before admission, she immigrated to Portugal from Angola. One month after being in Portugal, she started feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, daily somnolence, and a persistent dry cough. She was medicated with an antihistaminic with some improvement of the cough. As the symptoms persisted, she had some laboratory tests, which showed microcytic hypochromic anemia that was medicated with iron replacement therapy. Two months later, she went to the emergency department due to aggravating symptoms, fever (of irregular pattern), weight loss (4 kg in 1 month), a low abdominal pain, and pain with inspiration in the right hemithorax. There was no associated past medical or surgical history and no history of recent disease in her family circle. She had no other signs or symptoms, namely, no menstrual disturbances (menarcha at 10 years), no urinary, respiratory (the cough subsided), or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination, a palpable painful hypogastric mass was found, hard on palpation and of irregular contours. A BCG vaccination scar was visible. She had an ultrasound (Fig. 1 ) that showed a large pelvic mass (about 12?×?8 cm), centered in the right adnexal area, predominantly cystic, complex, encapsulated, with multiple thin septa and a solid component that exhibited some vascularity in the Color Doppler study (Fig. 1b), creating a mass effect on the uterus and bladder. The left ovary was heterogeneous and mildly enlarged (not shown). There were associated terminal ileum, peritoneal thickening (Fig. 2 ), and mild ascitis. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR; Fig. 3 ) documented a complex cystic mass, apparently having its epicenter on the right adnexal area, with high signal in T2W sequences and intermediate-to-low signal in T1W sequence, with no saturation on fat-suppressed sequences. The multiple septa were thin, irregular, and had no definite enhancement on post gadolinium sequences. A solid enhancing component was not confirmed. Upon scrolling the sagittal images, the lesion suggested to be contiguous with the uterine horn and terminating at the right ovary, hence a hydropyosalpingitis was neither confirmed nor excluded. There was some distortion of ileal loops that were hard to characterize as they were retracted and adherent close together and in apposition with the mass. Despite this, the lesion seemed to be encapsulated and well defined. Some peritoneal enhancement was noted. No adenopathies were visible in the pelvis or in the lomboaortic chains. Chest radiograph (Fig. 4 a) revealed an obliteration of the right costophrenic angle extending upwards along the lateral wall, suggesting a loculated effusion. The corresponding chest ultrasound (Fig. 4b and c) exhibited a pleural effusionat the right lung base, anechogenic, with some thin septa, extending superiorly to the middle lung and causing passive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. Laboratory investigations elicited a normal leucogram and C-reactive protein (CRP), persistence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia (9.1 g/dL) and an elevated CA-125 (576 U/mL, normal values <35 U/mL). As an ovarian malignant tumor was suspected, she was submitted to an exploratory laparotomy with the intent of an eventual resection. A large right adnexal whitish mass was found, occupying the small pelvis, with an uninterrupted capsule, from which adhesions emanated to the bladder and ileon bowel walls, preventing it from resection. There was extensive perilesional inflammatory reaction, adherent to the peritoneal fat and lateral wall of the pelvic region, and multiple lesions with morphology suggestive of implants to the wall of the ileal loops in contact with the mass and in the peritoneum adjacent to the mass. The biopsy of the lesion revealed numerous granulomata with giant cells but no caseous necrosis and no evidence of neoplastic cells. Further laboratory testing revealed an elevated seric ADA (83 U/L, normal ranges being 4.8-23 U/L). As the results of the initial mass sample testing were nonspecific, she was submitted to an ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic lesion and a diagnostic thoracocentesis (also ultrasound guided). The tuberculin skin testing (TST/Mantoux) was marginally positive (13 mm). Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON testing was negative but further testing with IGRA T-SPOT was positive, substantiating the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis. Pleural liquid analysis revealed a very elevated LDH (1083 U/L, 5 times the normal seric value) and elevated ADA (188 U/L, normal being < 45 U/L), with normal leucocyte count. No BK was identified either by PCR or cultural exam. The mass aspirate was PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Almost 1 month later, cultural examination became positive for M. tuberculosis. She started antibacillary therapy with progressive symptomatic and overall improvement. After 8 months on combined antibacillary therapy, ultrasonography (Fig. 5 ) exhibited a residual complex cystic lesion in the right adnexal area, with some distortion of normal ovarian morphology. CA-125 returned to normal values. ",0
126,S193004331830339X,Rare radiological features of abdominopelvic tuberculosis: A case report," Case presentation A 26-year-old woman, para 1 lived 1, was referred to our medical center with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient noted that for the last 3 months she had been gradually experiencing intermittent vaginal bleeding, as well as progressive hypogastric and bilateral lower quadrants abdominal pain. The abdominal pain did not spread to any other spots and did not get relieved or aggravated by any factors. The patient noted that she had no history of any specific diseases. Furthermore, her menstrual cycles had always been regular and previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient also complained of weakness and 5 kg of weight loss (67–62 kg) in the past 3 months. The patient did not report the symptoms of urinary tract infection, coughing and sputum, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, recent travel, and history of any malignancies in her family. Upon examination, the blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg, temperature was 37.8?C, pulse rate was 88 bpm, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. There was a mild tenderness in both the lower quadrants without rebound tenderness. Her abdomen was mildly distended but the shifting dullness examination was negative and there were firm, mobile, and ill-defined edge masses in both lower quadrants. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography showed multicystic adnexal masses; because of the adhesions in the peritoneal cavity, it was impossible to identify peritoneal fluid collection from the cystic enlargement of the ovaries. For further evaluation, the abdominopelvic computed tomography scan was done which demonstrated a multicystic adnexal mass of 2.6?×?2.3 cm with an inaccurate site of origin and diffused nodular peritoneal and omental thickening (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's level of cancer antigen (CA), at 125, was more than the normal range (145 U/mL), but the alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotrophin levels were normal. Her chest X-ray was also normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a microcytic anemia, normal leukocyte count and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80 mm/hr). Laparotomy was performed on the patient due to the mass observed in the ovary and increased serum levels of CA-125 with the presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Lots of adhesions and ovaries covered with granulomatosis lesions were observed. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy were conducted and biopsies from the omentum and peritoneum were taken. Surgery was performed without any complications and no complications occurred postoperatively. Histopathology revealed that fragments of fibroconnective tissue contain numerous well-formed granulomas with extensive caseous necrosis, which was highly indicative of tuberculosis. After that, the result of acid-fast stains confirmed tuberculosis. After the diagnosis of tuberculosis, she underwent antituberculosis treatment.   ",0
128,S1054880715001210,Pancardiac tuberculosis — a case report," 2 Case history A 14-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with complaints of progressive dyspnea, chest pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss since 1 year. She weighed 27 kg for an expected weight of 41 kg. Her pulse was 90/min; respiratory rate was 16/min. There was bilateral pedal edema. Her hemoglobin was 9.4 gm%; total count was 6100/cm2 with 80% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes. Her liver function tests and renal function tests were in normal limits. X-ray chest was performed and showed cardiomegaly. However, there was no calcification noted in the pericardium. A 2D echo showed a thick pericardium about 10 mm, right atrial enlargement, and depressed left ventricular function; Left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] was 40% suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Her condition deteriorated, and she expired on the second day of hospital stay. A complete postmortem was performed. She was an averagely build and poorly nourished female. She had mild pallor and bilateral pedal edema. Examination of chest cavity showed 300-ml pleural effusion on right side. Both the lungs showed 1-mm pinhead sized tubercles on the pleural as well as the cut surface. Heart was enlarged, globular, and weighed 1440 g. Visceral and parietal pericardiums were thickened and opaque, adherent to each other and to the lungs and diaphragm suggestive of pericarditis (Fig. 1 ). On cut section, pericardium was 10-mm thick whitish opaque and firmly adherent to the myocardium. There were multiple diffused white nodular lesions with caseation seen in the pericardium, myocardium reaching up to the endocardium with focal ulceration of the endocardium (Figs. 2 and 3  ). All the chambers of the heart along with the interventricular septum showed involvement by similar lesions. Mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged and matted together; cut surface showed caseation. Spleen and liver also showed multiple miliary tubercles. Brain showed cerebral edema. All the rest of the organs were unremarkable. Histopathological examination of the heart showed extensive areas of caseation with epithelioid cells, Langhan's giant cells, and lymphocytesin in the pericardium, myocardium, and endocardium (Fig. 4 ). Epithelioid cell granulomas with and without caseation were seen in the mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, spleen, and liver. Acid fast bacilli [AFB] stain was done on the section of the heart which was positive for acid-fast bacilli. This case had disseminated tuberculosis with pan cardiac involvement. ",0

He had presented with open mouth and snoring during sleep. Anterior rhinoscopic examination revealed middle turbinate hypertrophy and pale appearance of nasal septum. Diagnostic nasal endoscopic examination showed vegetative mass with smooth surface at the nasopharynx (Fig. 1 ). Rest of the ENT examinations and routine blood investigations were within normal limit. Sputum microscopy and culture were negative for acid fast bacilli whereas bacteriological examination from nasopharyngeal swab showed acid-fast bacilli and the quenching probe PCR test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no evidence of active pulmonary and systemic tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT scan) was done to rule out any mass and its extent at the nasopharynx. CT scan showed large mass occupying the nasopharynx (Fig. 2 ). A bit of tissue was taken from nasopharynx with help of endoscopy under local anesthesia and histopathological examination revealed caseous granulomatous lesion, non-necrotizing granuloma under the ciliated respiratory mucosa. The granulation tissue showed coagulation necrosis and Langerhans type of giant cells at the center (Fig. 3 ). No malignant cells were seen and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Patient was treated with antitubercular therapy (ATT) of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9?months. Patient was clinically improved in third month of treatment and the nasopharyngeal mass was resolved around 4th month months of ATT. ",0

132,S2210261218302311,Rare case of sacrococcygeal tuberculosis mimicking as an anal fistula," 2 Presentation of case A 93-year-old Japanese man who presented with gluteal and coccygeal pain was referred to our hospital. Furthermore, discharging were observed in his fistula in the posterior peri-anal region. He had neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. He had history of pulmonary TB at 25 years of age, and underwent surgery for the removal of complex anal fistula at 75 years of age at another institution. Based on clinical examination, there were two fistulous orifices between the anus and coccyx with purulent discharge (Fig. 1 ). He did not present with cough, fever, weight loss, and anorexia. The chest radiograph result was normal, and hematologic examination showed no abnormalities, except for a slight elevation in C-reactive protein level. Fistulography showed a complex supra-elevator track that is connected to the pre-sacral area and another track ending blindly behind the rectum. The connection between the track and the rectum or anus was not identified on fistulography (Fig. 2 ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole body reveled a lytic destruction of the sacrum (S3-5) and coccyx, with a low-density area in front of the sacrum, suggesting fluid collection (Fig. 3 A). No abnormality was found in the lungs and other vertebrae on CT scan. Colonoscopy findings showed normal colorectal mucosa and no evidence of fistula. Based on these radiological findings and the past medical history of the patient, the recurrence of complex anal fistula with osteomyelitis, or metastatic bone tumor of unknown origin, was suspected. Bacterial examination of the fistula discharge showed normal bacterial culture and was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). However, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using COBAS TaqMan MTB test (Roche Molecular Systems, the USA) was used to test the cold abscess fluid, and results showed that the patient was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AFB test and PCR were negative for sputum. However, the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, the UK) blood test result was positive. Thus, the diagnosis of isolated sacrococcygeal TB was confirmed. The patient was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 7 months. The patient’s pain resolved, and the purulent drainage stopped within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on the physical findings, closure of the fistula was not achieved. However, the PCR test result for PCR DNA turned to be negative. A follow-up CT scan was carried out during treatment, and results showed that fluid collection in front of sacrum had disappeared (Fig. 3B). ",0
133,S120197121830047X,A case-report of a pulmonary tuberculosis with lymphadenopathy mimicking a lymphoma," Case report A 22-year-old Somalian male was referred to the Respiratory Diseases Unit of the university hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, in June 2016. He complained of thoracic pain during his stay in an immigrant reception center, without reporting fever, cough, or any clinically significant comorbidities. The physical examination showed enlarged, not movable, and tender latero-cervical lymph nodes, as well as crackles in the right emi-thorax. Chest X-ray showed a right middle lobe atelectasis and increased bronchovascular markings. Blood examinations showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6g/dl (suspected hypochromic and microcytic anemia), a white blood cell count of 3,930 cells/mm3 (55% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes, 2% eosinophils), and a platelet count of 311,000 cells/mm (Davies et al., 2008). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (6.24mg/dl and 113mm/h, respectively); gamma-globulins on electrophoresis were high but without any monoclonal spikes. His renal and liver function tests were within normal range. Total IgE were 4,820IU/ml. Albumin level was below the normal values (4.00g/dl). A chest CT scan (Figure 1 ) with contrast infusion showed a generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly in the following anatomical sites: latero-cervical (sized ?25–50mm), supraclavicular, subclavian, mediastinal, and sub-diaphragmatic. Para-tracheal, para-cardiac, and right hilar lymph nodes were confluent and enlarged (diameter size: ?30–50mm); furthermore, a right middle lobe collapse, a tree-in bud parenchymal infiltrate, and a right shift of trachea and its bifurcation were found. Spleen showed multiple and rounded lesions. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were smear- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only lymphocytes (CD3+ 90%, CD4+ 68% CD8+ 17%, CD4+/CD8+ 4) were found in the BAL cellular count. A trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the right para-tracheal lymph node was performed; however, the histological pattern was not specific (i.e., non-specific chronic inflammation). Ultrasound scans suggested a lymphoproliferative disorder based on the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, liver enlargement, and small, multiple spleen abscesses. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node. A chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells and central necrosis was found in the histopathological examination. Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott, and Ziehl-Nielsen stained slides did not show any abnormal findings. Immunohistochemistry did not detect tumor cellular markers (i.e., AE1/AE3, CD3, CD20). Based on the clinical features, an empirical anti-TB treatment was started (ethambutol 1.2g/day, isoniazid 300mg/day, rifampicin 600mg/day, pyrazinamide 1.5g/day). However, his clinical conditions rapidly worsened (abdominal pain, vomit, fever, dehydration, elevated liver transaminases levels). One week after TB treatment initiation a left pleural effusion occurred (then, classified as TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). A sample of 2,000ml of pleuritic liquid was collected: it was limpid yellowish, with LDH level of 369U/L, total protein of 4.7g/dl, glucose of 60mg/dl, and PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After 47 days, a BAL culture conversion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurred. The drug susceptibility pattern did not show any drug resistances (i.e., isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Patient was discharged from hospital and underwent a new chest CT scan (Figure 1) after 6 months of treatment. It found an improvement of the atelectasis of the right middle lobe, and a decreased size of the subcarinal, right hilar, and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes. ",0
134,S1201971218345211,The use of bedaquiline to treat patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and end-stage renal disease: A case report," Case reports  Patient 1 In August 2016, a 46-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of pre-extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Two months before that visit, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary and peritoneal TB and had commenced first-line drugs. Subsequent phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) revealed pre-XDR-TB, after which he was transferred to our hospital (Table 1 ). The patient exhibited hypertension and ESRD (anuria requiring conventional hemodialysis three times weekly). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Baseline serum creatinine levels were 8.12mg/dl pre-hemodialysis and 3.97mg/dl post-hemodialysis. The baseline QTcF interval was 441ms on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, amikacin, moxifloxacin, cycloserine, linezolid, and bedaquiline after obtaining informed consent. Bedaquiline was started at 200mg three times weekly and was given for 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse reaction related to bedaquiline was encountered. One year after treatment initiation, amikacin and linezolid were permanently discontinued because of a hearing disturbance and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In April 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 607 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire course of treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 469ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.   Patient 2 In September 2016, a 53-year-old HIV-negative Korean man was referred to Pusan National University Hospital for the treatment of MDR-TB. He had taken first-line drugs in 2013 and 2014 to treat drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Three months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB once more and placed on first-line drugs. Subsequent DST revealed MDR-TB, and he was then transferred to our hospital (Table 1). The patient exhibited hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C virus infection, and chronic kidney disease (average urine volume 1500ml/day without a requirement for maintenance renal replacement therapy). On initial examination, sputum staining and culture for M. tuberculosis were negative. The baseline serum creatinine level was 3.04mg/dl (the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 21.7ml/min/1.73m2). The baseline QTcF interval was 424ms on ECG monitoring. Based on the DST results, the patient was commenced on treatment with pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, amikacin, prothionamide, and cycloserine. Unfortunately, acute kidney injury developed 6 days later (the serum creatinine level increased to 5.1mg/dl, combined with oliguria), and amikacin was thus discontinued permanently. After 2 months, bedaquiline was added to the treatment regimen after obtaining informed consent. (Due to administrative issues, bedaquiline could not be started immediately after discontinuing the amikacin.) Bedaquiline was commenced at 400mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200mg three times weekly. In February 2017 (5 months after treatment commencement and 3 months after the addition of bedaquiline), the patient started conventional maintenance hemodialysis (three times weekly) because renal impairment had progressed. Bedaquiline treatment was continued unchanged for a total of 24 weeks without any discontinuation. No adverse drug reaction related to bedaquiline was observed. Five months after treatment initiation, pyrazinamide was replaced by para-aminosalicylic acid because the patient developed gout. Sputum cultures remained negative throughout treatment, and clinical and radiological improvements were evident. In June 2018, he successfully completed treatment (total duration of 653 days). ECG monitoring was conducted daily for the first 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Over the entire treatment, the maximum QTcF interval was 463ms (on day 2 after bedaquiline commencement). No clinically significant cardiac event was noted.  ",0
135,S1413867015002147,Oral manifestation of tuberculosis: a case-report," Case-report A 61-year-old male patient with a history of smoking habit and alcohol abuse was being followed up for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy associated with vasculopathy, systemic hypertension, and chronic pancreatitis in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The patient was referred to the Stomatology Unit of the same hospital due to the emergence of lesions on the oral mucosa. Preliminary examination revealed two lesions, each measuring approximately 10mm across and presenting a granulomatous central portion and whitish halo. The lesions were located on the upper lip mucosa near the median line and on the left jugal mucosa adjacent to the labial anterior commissure (Fig. 1A and B, respectively). The patient complained of pain, productive cough for the past 15 days, night sweats, episodic fever in the morning, and slight weight loss in the previous two months. However, these complaints were intermittently made by the patient along the scheduled appointments, which may have added to the difficulty for an early diagnosis of the disease. Samples of lesions were collected by incision and stained according to the hematoxylin–eosin (HE) and Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocols. The pathological report was negative for the presence of alcohol–acid resistant microorganisms (Fig. 2 ). Due to the comparatively low count of microorganisms in the tissues analyzed, the special staining used did not successfully detect the presence of the bacterium. However, since a negative result in this kind of analysis does not rule out TB, a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage was analyzed according to the Ziehl–Neelsen (BAAR) protocol, with a positive result for M. tuberculosis. A radiograph of the thorax was suggestive of presence of active infectious disease, manifested as budding tree-like centrilobular nodules in both lungs, especially on the right. In this case report, the pathological analysis of the samples collected from the patient was not conclusive, requiring a Mantoux assay and the investigation of bronchoalveolar lavage in order to confirm the TB suspicion. The Mantoux protocol indicated a 13-mm inflammatory reaction confirming TB. Anti-HIV test was negative. The patient was referred to a pulmonologist for examination and treatment based on the pulmonary extension of the disease (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, 30 days into the treatment the patient died due to the worsening of clinical conditions, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney failure. ",0
136,S0976566216000412,Horner's syndrome in cervico-dorsal tuberculosis: A rare case report," 2 Case report A 6-year-old male child was brought to our OPD by his parents with chief complaint of weakness of all four limbs for the past 15 days. Weakness was acute in onset and progressively increasing. In addition to this, the patient had pain in upper back and neck with low-grade fever. There was no history of trauma or any other significant complaint. On physical examination, there was deep midline tenderness in cervical and upper dorsal region of spine. Neurologically, there was motor weakness in all four limbs, and sensations and sphincteric functions were intact. The patient was initially managed by absolute bed rest and supportive treatment. Subsequently, when he was evaluated, ESR and CRP both were raised. Radiograph of cervical spine showed straightening with maintained vertebral height and disc spaces. MRI was suggestive of spondylodiscitis along with phlegmonous soft tissue changes in pre- and para-vertebral region of cervico-dorsal spine extending from C3 to D3 vertebra (Figs. 1 and 2  ). Diagnosis of tuberculosis of cervico-dorsal spine was made on the basis of suggestive history, examination, and relevant investigation. One interesting finding we noticed in this patient was association of ptosis and miosis (Fig. 3 ) in left eye with on-going disease process. Enophthalmos and anhidrosis were not seen. Pupillary light reflex was present along with absent ciliospinal reflex. This led to our diagnosis of Horner's syndrome in left eye, which can be a complication of cervico-dorsal tuberculosis. The patient was managed with antitubercular chemotherapy and immobilization of spine using head halter traction. Neurological complications showed some improvement from 3rd week of treatment. At 4th week, traction was released and spine was immobilized on four post collar. At 3 months, there was complete improvement in motor weakness while ocular complication took longer time to recover. At 6 months, the patient showed complete improvement. ATT was continued for one and a half years. ",0

138,S2173579417302062,"Tuberculosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or both? A case report"," Clinic case report Female, 37, who visited due to periocular pain, red eye, edema and erythema of eyelids as well as proptosis in the left eye, with 3 weeks evolution. Previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed at another hospital 4 months earlier on the basis of clinic and compatible imaging confirmed with quantiferon test. The patient had been treated with a quadruple approach comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) during 3 months. At the visit, treatment consisted in rifampicin and isoniazid, which achieved complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. Ophthalmological examination produced a visual acuity of 20/20 in the right eye (RE) and 20/30 in the left eye (LE). The latter was outwardly and forwardly displaced. Hertel exophthalmometry was 12mm in the RE and 21mm in the LE with base in 104. The patient exhibited palpebral edema and erythema, conjunctival chemosis and hyperemia (Fig. 1A). LE ocular motility was moderately limited in all fields of gaze. No intraocular inflammation evidence was found while funduscopy and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. When questioned, the patient denied having other systemic symptoms. After suspecting orbital cellulitis, the patient was hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics without clinic improvement. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), requested upon admission of the patient, revealed a mass in the left orbit compromising the intra-and extra-conal compartments with apparent ethmoidal sinus compromise. The lesion exhibited moderate enhancement with gadolinium (Fig. 1B and C). Taking into account previous TB history, a chest X-ray was taken which showed pleural thickening with increased vascular pattern in the middle lobe of the right lung and inferior cavitations in the left lung (Fig. 2A). Hemogram showed anemia with 10.5g/dl hemoglobin and leukopenia of 3900cells/ml of leukocytes and platelets at 405,000cells/ml. C-reactive protein was positive at 1:160, with increased globular sedimentation velocity of 47mm/h. Creatinine clearing in 24-hour urine was slightly diminished at 51.8ml/min. ELISA test for HIV was negative. Test for hepatitis C, VDRL, FTA-ABS, rheumatoid factor and serum PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were likewise negative. Orbit biopsy was performed through anterior orbitotomy, which evidenced fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels with inflammatory infiltrates comprising lymphocytes, neutrophiles and some eosinophiles (Fig. 2B and C). With these findings, ANCA PR3 (c-ANCA) and MPO (p-ANCA) were analyzed, finding elevated levels of PR3 (c-ANCA) up to 59U/ml. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with GP. Treatment consisted in oral prednisone and 100mg/day cyclophosphamide during 10 months. Thereafter, treatment was switched to methotrexate which produced complete and sustained resolution of the orbit inflammation (Fig. 3A). Hertel exopthalmometry diminished to 17mm in the LE although ocular motility of this eye persisted with a limitation of ?1 for elevation and adduction, without subjective diplopia. Post-treatment orbital computerized tomography (CT) showed diminished mass in the orbit and proptosis. It also evidenced left rhinosinus disease (Fig. 3B and C). After 3 years of sustained remission, medical treatment was suspended. A few weeks later, the patient began to exhibit left diffuse anterior scleritis that resolved completely after medical treatment. Following this episode, immunosuppressant treatment was resumed. With a follow-up of 3 years, the patient remains stable and without vasculitis relapse in treatment with azathioprine and low dose of prednisone. ",0
139,S2211753916300598,Chronic Paracoccidioidomycosis with adrenal involvement mimicking tuberculosis – A case report from Austria," 2 Case A 62-year-old man was transferred from a community hospital to our department due to suspected diagnosis of reactivated tuberculosis of the lungs and adrenal glands in February 2015 (day 0). He reported left-sided chest and abdominal pain, weight loss of 12kg during the last 3 weeks as well as night sweats and cough. The punctum maximum of the abdominal pain was located at the left costal margin and aggravated at inspiration. Past medical history revealed several episodes of tuberculosis with involvement of the lungs, testes and adrenal glands ( Fig. 1). The patient reported that tuberculosis was diagnosed for the first time at the age of 7 years, followed by reactivations in the lungs with dissemination to the testes at the age of 14 and 21. Therefore, the patient had received tuberculostatic therapy, repeatedly. In 2010, he underwent CT-guided biopsy of a suspicious pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe and left adrenal gland due to considerable enlargement of adrenal glands. Based on the histopathological finding of epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis, the diagnosis of tuberculosis of lungs and adrenal glands was made. At that time, sputum smear, PCR and culture for acid fast bacilli were negative. Due to increasing size of the adrenal glands the patient underwent a second biopsy in the same hospital in 2012. Histopathological finding were similar to previous biopsy and again considered to be tuberculosis. From the year 1997 until 2001 he made yearly visits – each for several weeks - to a village in Regio de Pasco (Peru), a rural area located next to the rainforest of the Amazonas. He lived there in a house with a garden for approximately three years (2002–2004) and helped to construct a hospital. He did no agricultural or field work. During his stay in Peru he had no injury or disease worth mentioning. Except for two days in Arica (Chile) he did not visit any other South or Central American regions or countries. In addition, he reported that one day he recognized bats in the ceiling of his house and inhaled their excrements during cleaning. In addition to tuberculosis our patient had a past medical history of chronic bronchitis, Billroth II surgery due to peptic ulcer disease, cholecystectomy and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy approximately 10 years ago. The patient was a retired patient transport service driver in an Austrian hospital. Family history revealed a tuberculosis infection of his father. He was a current smoker with a history of 45 pack years, reported occasional alcohol consumption and no known allergies. He was on no chronic medication. Upon admission, the patient appeared in a good general condition with normal body temperature and a blood pressure of 120/70mmHg. Auscultation and percussion of lungs and heart were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft and showed periumbilical tenderness without resistance. Peripheral edema was not observed. Basic neurological examination and skin were unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with 78 beats per minute and no pathological findings. There was a mild eosinophilia (6%) and monocytosis (16%), but total white cell count (8.1G/l), hemoglobin (13.9g/dl), and platelet count (366G/l) were within normal limits. Levels of serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were normal. The concentration of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT, 193U/l), alkaline phosphatase (224U/l), and C-reactive protein (9.0mg/dl), plasma fibrinogen (560mg/dl), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 54/81mm) were elevated. Serum albumin (3.4g/dl) and sodium (135mmol/l) were slightly decreased while other electrolytes were normal. Myocardial biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin-T (hs-TnT), creatine kinase (CK) and muscle-brain type creatine kinase (CK-MB) were within normal range. Computed tomography (CT) showed postspecific pulmonary lesions. Compared to previous examinations, abdominal CT (day +0) revealed an increasing inhomogeneous enlargement of the adrenal glands (4.0×6.3cm) ( Fig. 2). Additionally, several enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenterial lymph nodes were found. Subsequently performed positron emission tomography (PET) (day +18) revealed an increased metabolic activity in bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands. Furthermore, hypermetabolic activity of cervical lymph nodes and the laryngeal area was found. Clinical and radiographic findings were suspicious for reactivation of tuberculosis. Interferon-gamma release assay (Quantiferon) (day +7) was positive but Ziehl-Neelsen smear, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of the sputum were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lues and adrenal autoantibodies were negative. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms such as tremor, disturbance of sensitivity and weakness of the extremities, triggered a neurological work-up. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (day +31) revealed a round temporo-parietal located lesion with perifocal edema, suspicious for infection or metastasis ( Fig. 3). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture (day +34) was unremarkable without any sign for infection, inflammation or neoplasm. Neurosurgeons did not consider surgical intervention. The cause of hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal enlargement remained unclear, initially. Tuberculosis was suspected but could not be confirmed by microbiology. Hence, CT guided biopsy of the left adrenal gland and extirpation of a right cervical lymph node (day +42) were performed for histopathological and microbiological work-up. Neither in the biopsy specimens of left adrenal gland nor the right cervical lymph node, Ziehl-Neelsen and PCR revealed any evidence for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (day +45). Serology for various systemic fungal infections and broad spectrum PCR from blood and aspirate fluids from biopsy (day +49) were negative as well. Histology of lymph node and left adrenal gland biopsy showed granulomas with central necrosis (day +48). In addition, in the left adrenal gland periodic acid–schiff (PAS), McManus, and methenamine silver stain (Grocott) revealed evidence of fungal pathogens. Giemsa stain of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen (day +49) showed characteristic yeast elements with multipolar budding of variable size thus indicating the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Fig. 4). Cultures of the left adrenal gland biopsy specimen, were positive after incubation for 5 days (day +54) at 37°C and 28°C on Columbia agar (with 5% sheep blood; bioMérieux, Austria), 2% Sabouraud dextrose agar (Oxoid, Austria) and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI agar, Merck, Austria). Sequence analysis of the isolate confirmed the presence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sequence similarity was assessed by a search of homology not only with GenBank sequences, but also with the ISHAM ITS database. 100% identity was achieved with both databases (ISHAM identification number: MITS2102). Thus, we diagnosed paracoccidioidomycosis with dissemination to adrenal glands and highly suspicious involvement of cervical lymph nodes and the brain. When paracoccidioidomycosis was suspected, the specimen and all cultures were processed in a special laboratory for biosafety level 3 (S3-laboratory). This laboratory has all the equipment and safety features required for biosafety level 3 with controlled air flow and filtered ventilation systems. All personnel wore personal protective equipment (specialized clothing, gloves whenever handling the specimens or cultures). In accordance to this, personnel had the utmost protection against accidental infection. After identification of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antifungal treatment was initiated ( Table 1). In addition, replacement therapy with fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone was prescribed. Due to the evidence of cerebral involvement the patient was initially treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. The patient's general clinical condition improved and the antifungal therapy was switched to oral itraconazole. However, itraconazole never reached therapeutic level - neither with capsule nor liquid formulation, most probably due to the previous Billroth II resection. After deterioration of the patient and an increase in inflammatory parameters, liposomal amphotericin B was restarted. Associated with worsening of the systemic inflammation, hypotension, prerenal kidney failure and subsequent Addison crises occurred, so that hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone doses had to be adapted and high volume intravenous (IV) fluids substituted. Several ultrasound imaging studies showed a continuous decrease in size of the bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and a follow-up MRI of the brain revealed a shrinking size of the cerebral lesion. Overall clinical improvement was observed. After consultation of an infectious disease specialist, our patient was switched to oral posaconazole. Finally, the patient was discharged in a good general condition on oral posaconazole. ",0
140,S120197121834431X,First case of sexually transmitted asymptomatic female genital tuberculosis from spousal epididymal tuberculosis diagnosed by active screening," Case reports  Patient 1 (index case) A 54-year-old man noticed a swelling of the right epididymis approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. He was initially considered to have acute epididymitis. Although the causative organism could not be identified by urine testing, he was prescribed oral levofloxacin. The swelling of the epididymis recurred several times and was relieved by levofloxacin each time. However, approximately 1.5 years before the diagnosis, the left epididymis also started to swell gradually. A left orchiectomy was performed, because a tumor of the epididymis was suspected. Pathological findings of the resected testis revealed multinucleated giant cells and numerous caseous granulomas. He was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases because tuberculosis was highly suspected. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with epididymal tuberculosis based on urine PCR, urine culture, and histopathological findings. Additionally, a T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and HIV antibody test were both negative. Findings on chest computed tomography (CT) scan were unremarkable except for calcification of a mediastinal lymph node. He had been diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years earlier, which had been resected; there had been no recurrence at the time of presentation. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated was susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, levofloxacin, and streptomycin. Treatment was commenced with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a further 4 months.   Patient 2 (infected spouse) A 53-year-old woman visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Toranomon Hospital with her husband (patient 1) to inquire about the possibility of sexual transmission of tuberculosis approximately 1 month after his diagnosis. They were worried, although she looked healthy and had no symptoms: no fever, night sweats, weight loss, pelvic or abdominal pain, menstrual disorder, or respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and cough. She had been having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband once a week until 6 months before the diagnosis of epididymal tuberculosis. However, she had then refrained from sexual intercourse with her husband when they noticed the apparent swelling of his left epididymis because she was afraid of contracting a sexually transmitted infection from him. She had no past history of illnesses or operations, except for migraine at about 20 years of age and bilateral tubal ligation at about 35 years of age after the delivery of their third child. She reported having no other sexual partners after marriage. Finally, it was decided to perform active screening for genital tuberculosis even though she was asymptomatic. Laboratory findings of blood and urine testing were unremarkable. A T-SPOT.TB test and HIV antibody test were both negative. Chest and abdominal CT scans that included the pelvic area were unremarkable. Furthermore, a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound performed by a gynecologist were unremarkable except for a right ovarian cyst. A biopsy was not performed because no abnormal findings were observed in the endocervical canal or endometrium at that time. However, vaginal swab culture yielded M. tuberculosis and she was diagnosed with genital tuberculosis. Treatment for tuberculosis was started with the same regimen as that of her husband. Both M. tuberculosis isolates were sent to the Research Institute of Tuberculosis (Tokyo, Japan) for further analysis. Variable number tandem repeat analysis (VNTR, 24 loci) showed that the organisms from the two cases were identical (Iwamoto et al., 2012). Further analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS; MiSeq, Illumina) confirmed that the two isolates were genetically identical with only one nucleotide difference (Sekizuka et al., 2015).  ",0
142,S2214442014000941,Tuberculosis of the Spermatic Cord: Case Report," Case presentation A 44-year-old patient with no medical history of personal or family tuberculosis showed a 4-cm painful swelling on the right testicle, which had appeared 3 months earlier. The patient had not lost weight and showed no sign of infection. Testicle ultrasonography revealed an isoechoic, cylindrical, paratesticular structure, measuring 4 cm in its largest diameter. Routine blood and urine tests were within normal values with no inflammatory signs. Alpha Foetoprotein and beta Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin were normal. No tuberculosis skin test was performed. A surgery was performed, revealing an indurated right spermatic cord caught in a fibrous magma extending from the tail of the epididymis to the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 1 ). The fibrous cord was dissected and isolated from all the elements of the spermatic cord, with preservation of the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels. The testes were reinstated in purse. Histology showed on a 4 × 2 × 1 cm specimen, an epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomatous process with foci of caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). A checkup was made afterward revealing no other tuberculous location. The patient was given a 6-month antituberculous treatment: 2 (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol) + 4 (rifampicin + isoniazid) with a satisfying uneventful evolution. ",0
143,S1054880716300102,“Death at the wheel” due to tuberculosis of the myocardium: a case report," 2 Case report The body of a 35-year-old adult African male was admitted to our medicolegal mortuary, the deceased having been the driver of a motor vehicle that had apparently inexplicably veered off the road and collided with a tree at relatively low speed. No specific history of prior cardiac problems or other underlying medical conditions could be established. At autopsy, the deceased was well-nourished, measuring 1.8m in length and with a body mass of 108kg. There were no external injuries. Internal examination revealed a grossly enlarged heart with a mass of 540g, but with only modestly increased epicardial fat deposits. Further dissection revealed extensive, partially confluent yellow to white nodular infiltrates involving the walls of all cardiac chambers. The nodules varied from 5 to 15mm in diameter and had a firm, rubbery consistency (Fig. 1 ). Macroscopically, the lungs and kidneys showed no overt signs of disease, but sectioning of the spleen revealed multiple small white parenchymal nodules measuring 1–2mm in diameter, in keeping with miliary TB. Histological examination of the heart showed well-formed granulomas that were present in the full thickness of the myocardium on some of the sections. These granulomas consisted of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes and Langhans type as well as multinucleated giant cells with central areas of caseous necrosis. No eosinophils, Aschoff cells or asteroid bodies noted (Fig. 2 ). Histological examination of the kidneys showed no abnormalities with no granulomas present but histology of the lungs and spleen revealed a similar granulomatous inflammatory process as seen in the heart. The histological examination of the lung and spleen is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4  . However, multiple attempts at demonstrating acid-fast bacilli from several sites of the myocardium by using the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain were unsuccessful (Fig. 5 ). The PAS stain on the myocardial tissue was negative (Fig. 6 ). ZN staining of the lungs and spleen was also negative. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was further performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue but again a negative result ensued. Despite the negative outcome of the special investigations and based primarily on the macroscopic and histological findings, a final diagnosis of TB with involvement of the myocardium was made. ",0

147,S221255311600008X,Chronic oozing skin lesions in children: Possible tuberculosis? Two case reports," Case 2 A 5-year-old female presented with multiple swellings and discharging sinuses (oozing thick, whitish fluid) over the skin of the left upper part of the neck and submandibular area. The surrounding skin was purple-blue in color with elevated edges. Six months later, the patient developed two upper-left cervical swellings and one submandibular swelling that was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics with no response. These swellings began to open by fistula to the outer skin, oozing thick white fluid (Fig. 4 ). The patient had no history of chest disease and no chest symptoms, and no contact history with a TB-related case. Routine biochemical analysis, complete blood count, and urine analysis were all normal. ESR was 70 for the 1st hour, and the chest radiograph was normal. The tuberculin test was positive (induration 22mm×24mm), and a quantiferon TB gold test was positive. Gastric lavage was negative for mycobacteria. Swabs from the discharging fluid were sent for pyogenic culture and culture for acid-fast bacilli. A neck ultrasound revealed multiple bilateral-cervical, left-supraclavicular, and left-axillary lymph nodes (LNs) ranging from 1.4cm to 1.7cm. Some of the cervical and supraclavicular LNs were forming cystic turbid abscesses from 0.7cm to 2.3cm in size. Skin and LN biopsy was done, with the skin showing dense dermal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells and minimal epithelioid granulomata and sinus-tract formation. The LN architecture was mostly replaced with caseating epithelioid granuloma with few multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 5 ). Both patients received Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. A scar is now present at the site of injection. The patient had no history of previous pulmonary TB since birth, and developmental and family histories were unremarkable, with no family members having a history of TB. ",0
148,S2352621116000061,A case report of atypical sarcoidosis misdiagnosed as tuberculosis," 2 Case report A 49 years old, female patient was hospitalized for abdominal discomfort, low grade fever (with the highest body temperature to be 37.8 °C) and long time cough lasting for about half a month. The cough presented as irritating cough accompanied with nausea, but without phlegm and emesis. It is known that the patient is healthy ordinarily and no obvious inducement was found for these above mentioned symptoms. Therefore, a series of regular examinations were carried out, including laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, CT scanning, and biopsy and pathological diagnosis. The regular laboratory examination was showed in Table 1 . Additionally, plenty of lymphocytes and less mesothelial cells were detected in pleural effusions, without finding heterocyst. For the bronchoscopy, no obstruction was visible within the left principal bronchus and its branches. No hyperaemia, edema and erosion were found in the lumen mucous membrane. No stenosis and neoplasm were visible within the lumen. Mucous membrane was normal in the right upper lobe bronchus while mild hyperemia was found in the mucosa of right lower lobe bronchus, and the corresponding lumen showed with mild distortion and obvious neoplasm development. It was shown with bronchial ridge hypertrophy and enlargement. There was apparent stenosis in the lateral bronchus of the middle-lobe, showing with white moss-like secretions. The bronchial mucosa was a bit brittle and would bleed when touched. For regular CT examination, irregular pulmonary consolidation was presented in the middle and lower lobes around the right hilum, with mean CT value of 44HU; bronchus shadow with narrowed lumen was visible inside the lumen, and swelling lymph node shadow was likely to be visible in the mediastinum; and, a small amount of pleural effusion was presented in the right thorax, while no obvious abnormity was visible in the left one (Fig. 1 ). For the contrast enhanced CT scanning, equally enhancing lesions were presented inside the lung and around pulmonary hilus, with the mean CT value of 98HU during arterial phase (Fig. 2 A), and local stenosis occurred inside the pulmonary artery; by contrast, during the venous phase, the mean CT value was 98 HU (Fig. 2B); multiple lymphadenectasis presented as equal enhancements were found within the right pulmonary hilus and mediastinum (behind the left atrium), while multiple small nodular shadows were visible in the right pleura; and no obvious lymphadenectasis was presented in the left pulmonary hilus.  2.1 Biopsy and pathological examination Biopsy was carried out for the right pleura under thoracoscope, and it was shown that about 500 ml pale yellow effusion was presented in the right thorax, and there were also pleural edema, thickening and adhesion in the right chest. Unequal multiple small nodules with diameters from about 0.3 cm to about 0.5 cm was found on the right side of the pleura, mediastinum, pericardium and pulmonary surface, and lump appeared around the right pulmonary hilus (Fig. 3 ). For further confirmation, the pathological diagnosis was carried out, which showed granulomatous inflammation accompanied with small necrosis, and the possibility of tuberculosis was not excluded. The results of acid fast stain were showed in Fig. 3. Ultrasonic bronchial endoscopy (Ebus) was carried out under general anesthesia, and the lymph node on the punctured right bronchus (region 4R) and subcarinal (region 7) lymph node were sent for biopsy, of which the results showed noncaseating granulomas (Fig. 4 ).

149,S2210261217301931,Ileocaecal and transverse colonic tuberculosis mimicking colonic malignancy – A case report," 2 Case presentation A 46year old female patient came walking to the outpatient department with a 6 month history of diffuse abdominal pain with low grade fever and loss of appetite and weight. No significant past medical or surgical history. There was no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On examination, general condition was fair, vitals were stable. Abdominal examination revealed a soft non tender abdomen with a normal digital per rectal examination. Haematological investigations were normal except erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) which was 80mm (0–30mm normal). Her serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA), cancer antigen19-9(CA 19-9) and serum adenosine deaminase(ADA) levels were within normal limits. Contrast enhanced CT(CECT) abdomen revealed a diffuse concentric long segmental circumferential wall thickening of terminal ileum, ileocaecal(IC) junction and ascending colon with peripheral fat stranding and lymphadenopathy with narrowing at the splenic flexure (Figs. 1–3   ). Colonoscopy showed an ulceronodular lesion with lumen compromise at the splenic flexure and thickening of the ileocaecal junction. Biopsy was taken from both the sites and sent for histopathological examination and also for culture and gene xpert for MTB. Pathology showed moderate mixed inflammation and occasional lymphoid collection in the lamina propria with no evidence of malignancy. There were also occasional crypt abscesses which raised suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. The final diagnosis of tuberculosis of the intestine was made as the biopsy smear showed AFBs and the Gene Xpert detected MTB. The patient was/started on Anti tubercular therapy. At 6 month follow up, patient is asymptomatic. Repeat CT scan shows no narrowing (Fig. 4 ). ",0

151,S2210261218304188,Breast tuberculosis cases rising in Sicily," 2 Clinical case We report a case of breast tuberculosis that was treated in the Breast Unit of our hospital. A 26 year-old Eritrean female with a personal history of HIV infection and familiar history of breast cancer (her sister had died at the age of 34) came to our Emergency Department showing generalized limphoadenopathy and weakness in addition to a huge right breast mass. The patient was subjected to a CT scan of neck, abdomen and chest, that revealed a big mass in the right breast of about 10?×?7?cm, bilateral latercervical colliquated lymph nodes, the biggest being 27?×?20?mm, many right ascellary and retropectoal lymph nodes, and paraaortic, celiac and paracavale lymph nodes, but no nodes in the chest and no pleural effusion. For this reason she was hospitalized in Medicine Department with a suspicious diagnosis of lymfoma. During the stay, she underwent a mammography (Fig. 1 ) which showed a generalized increased radioopacity spread throughout the right breast. Ultrasound scan was apparently useful for characterising the ill-defined breast mass and excluding the presence of solid masses. But the findings of a hypoechoic lesion with heterogeneous internal echoes and irregular borders were not specific ones. The Color Doppler showed increased circumferential vascularization in avascular centered lesions which might be interpreted as a sign of continuity of the infective process. For this reason it was diagnosed a breast abscess [14]. While being treated with antinflammatory drugs and a aspecific antibiotica therapy, the patient came up to our Breast Surgery Unit Department because she had not had any improvement of symptoms. Our examination revealed a tender mass measuring 12?×?10?cm that involved all right breast. Her skin was not erythematous and local temperature was normal. She was painless. The mass was soft in consistency, floating and mobile on the chest wall and there were no signs of inflammation. It meant the possible presence of a “cold abscess” or a big cystis. Moreover, there was a clinically palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy. The total leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were low; the other blood tests were normal except for the electrophoretic protidogram where we found a high level of gamma globuline. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) showed a milky and greenish shaded fluid. On needle aspiration, some thick pus came out and it was drained out of about 200?ml. The pus was sent for bacteriological, citological and coltural test, the results of which were negative for aerobic, anaerobic bacteria and fungi. The patient had a latercervical lymph node core biopsy that exluded lymphoma. The evaluation of the specimen revealed only inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and abundant macrophages, granulomas with central caseaous necrosis and epitheloid histiocytes. But by means of nucleic acid probes and PCR, it was possibile to identify the Mycobacterium tuberculosis [20]. The laterocervical limph node was due to a scrofulous swelling. The patient was put on anti-tubercular drugs treatment (rifampicin 600?mg, isoniazid 300?mg, pyrazinamide 1500?mg and ethambutol 1000?mg per day) for 2 months which continued with the addition of rifampicin and isoniazid therapy for 4 additional months. In the follow-up period of 6 months, the patient recovered very well and was advised to continue the treatment. At the end of the antituberculous treatment period, the patient appeared to be clinically and radiologically without any evidence of residual disease. ",0

No history of cough with expectoration. No history of fever. Patient was apparently normal prior to these 4 months. Blood investigations revealed leucocytosis with lymphocytosis, with an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate. Patient tested negative for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patient underwent Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy by an experienced gastroenterologist which revealed a hemi circumferential ulcerative growth from 30cm to 34cm in the distal esophagus from which biopsy was taken (Fig. 1 ). Contrast enhanced computed tomography of the thorax showed circumferential thickening involving the distal esophagus, no evidence of invasion of adjacent structures seen, enlarged aortopulmonary lymph node with necrosis (Fig. 2 ). Histopathology revealed ill defined epithelioid granulomas with giant cells and caseating necrosis, no evidence of malignancy, no acid-fast bacilli seen. Tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR) was positive. Patient was started on ATT and was asked to review after 2 months of intensive phase of ATT with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. On follow up patient had symptomatically improved and repeat UGI scopy showed complete resolution of the lesion (Fig. 1). Patient was advised to continue ATT as per the protocol.

Cases were all 22 patients with drug resistance selected by census method. In order to increase the power of the study, four patients with treatment success were randomly selected per each case. Cases and controls were individually matched based on the year of incidence and the treatment center. Required information such as gender, age, residence area, history of imprisonment, close contact with TB patient and previous TB treatment and also type of TB, drug reactions and HIV status was obtained from the TB registry software of the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences in the excel format. The ethical considerations were met based on the Helsinki declaration. To respect privacy, the patients’ name and national codes were excluded from the dataset. The collected data were transferred into the SPSS version 16. Descriptive statistics was performed using mean, standard deviation and percent frequency. Comparing the factors between cases and controls was carried out using independent T test. Multivariate logistic regression models were applied to detect the predictors of the drug resistance. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ",0
157,S2405579418300597,Miliary tuberculosis presenting as a choroidal mass and a tuberculosis screening review," 2 Case description A middle-aged Chinese male with a known history of Crohn's disease was treated with nine doses of infliximab in China. He presented to the United States for a second opinion regarding his persistent abdominal pain. In China, his inflammatory bowel disease had resolved and was confirmed by colonoscopy, He had been started on azathioprine, but his symptoms worsened. Repeat colonoscopy showed recurrence of Crohn's disease. He was restarted on infliximab and the patient received four doses. Follow up colonoscopy revealed improvement in colonic mucosa on biopsy but again no resolution of his abdominal pain. He then noticed blurring of vision in the left eye which progressively worsened to loss of vision. Over a month period, his right eye developed visual changes. An ophthalmologist diagnosed a 4?cm choroid mass in the left eye and a normal right eye examination (Fig. 1 A). Infliximab was discontinued and anti-tubercular treatment with ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide was initiated in China. After two months of anti-tubercular therapy, he had clinical improvement of his abdominal symptoms, a decrease in size of the left eye choroid mass, and stabilization of his vision loss. The patient sought a second opinion regarding Crohn's disease vs. intestinal tuberculosis at our institution. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen showed multiple subcentimeter lesions in liver, spleen, lung, 4.5?cm mass on pole of left kidney and many subcentimeter lesions in both kidneys, diffuse colitis, hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with miliary tuberculosis (Fig. 1B–D). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment for miliary tuberculosis. ",0

Symptoms included fatigue, night sweats, and fever, as well as a non-productive cough. He reported unintentional weight loss of 30 pounds over three months, as well as ten days of worsening low back pain that radiated to his thighs. Notably, the patient had immigrated to the United States from India two-and-a-half years prior to this admission and had briefly visited India one year prior. He had no history of tuberculosis, and he denied any known exposures to tuberculosis. In the emergency department, he was febrile to 103.1°F and tachycardic to 160 beats per minute. However, he was normotensive and breathing comfortably on room air with an oxygen saturation of 97%. On general examination, he appeared thin but was awake and alert in no acute distress. On pulmonary examination, he was found to have decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the right middle and lower lung fields, as well as mild clubbing of the digits. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. He received a chest x-ray and subsequent CT angiogram of the chest, which demonstrated a large right loculated pleural effusion, right upper lobe density, right-sided compressive atelectasis, multiple bilateral subcentimeter nodules, and a 1.5 cm right hepatic lesion (Fig. 1 ). To evaluate his reported back pain, an MRI of the lumbar spine was ordered, and the results showed multiple poorly defined bony lesions consistent with metastatic disease in the vertebral bodies (Fig. 2 A). In an attempt to identify the primary source of the metastases, an ultrasound of the testes was then performed, which demonstrated bilateral masses suspicious for additional metastases, though primary testicular malignancy could not be excluded by imaging alone. Follow-up serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-hCG levels were within normal limits. Initial hematologic studies revealed a mild normocytic anemia, leukocytosis, and mild thrombocytosis. A metabolic panel revealed hyponatremia (127 mmol/dL) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (201 IU/L), and hypoalbuminemia. Thoracentesis was performed upon admission, which showed a lymphocyte-predominant exudative effusion. No acid fast bacteria were isolated from the pleural fluid, and an adenosine deaminase (ADA) level was normal. The patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy, and the culture was negative for acid fast bacilli after six weeks. However, transbronchial biopsy demonstrated necrotizing granulomas in the lung and fibrous tissue. Stains for mycobacteria and fungi were negative. This was followed by pleural biopsy, which was also negative for mycobacterial culture but demonstrated focal granulomatous inflammation. Interferon gamma release assay (QuantiFERON Gold) and tuberculin skin test were both positive. The patient was started on antibiotic therapy of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. After a week of treatment, the patient continued spiking fevers, we proceeded to ruling out central nervous system involvement. An MRI of the brain was done and demonstrated calcanerium abscesses, infiltration of the bone marrow, and thickening of the dura (Fig. 2B). Given these findings, a bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture were performed, which were both normal with once again negative acid fast bacilli staining and culture. The patient continued with standard antituberculous therapy and gradually improved. After his fevers resolved and mental status normalized, the patient was discharged. ",0

During the study period, all patients diagnosed with a M. tuberculosis PJI in these centers were managed by a multidisciplinary team including specialists in infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, and microbiology. We only enrolled patients with at least one PJI sample (i.e., joint aspirates or synovial tissue) positive for M. tuberculosis by culture or PCR. Patients who were previously diagnosed with native joint tuberculosis by the time of arthroplasty were not enrolled. Cases were identified through computerized databases from the microbiology departments and the infectious diseases units of the participating sites. Clinical, biological, and microbiological data were extracted from medical charts through a standardized questionnaire, as well as the type and dates of PJI surgery(ies), antituberculosis drugs, and outcome. Physicians in charge were requested to categorize the outcome as favorable, unknown, or not favorable. The study was approved by the Rennes University Hospital Institutional Review Board. For the literature review, we searched Medline and Embase for articles in English or French published before January 2018, using the keywords “prosthetic joint infection” and “tuberculosis”. ",0

There was no postmenopausal bleeding. Menopause had occurred at the age of 45years. Her general medical, gynaecological and family histories were unremarkable, as were physical (including pelvic) examinations. Her chest X-ray was normal. Ultrasonography showed that the uterus was of normal size but with an endometrial collection. Arising from the right anterior wall there was a polypoidal solid lesion showing mild vascularity and measuring 10×6mm, which was suspected to be a neoplasm (Fig. 1 ). There were also free fluid and multiple tiny peritoneal nodules. A computerised tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 2 ) showed that the pelvic structures were of normal size but also a small collection of fluid was seen in the endometrial cavity. Also noted were gross ascites and a few peritoneal cystic and tiny solid nodules. No pelvic mass was detected. Purulent fluid from the endometrial cavity was collected by cervical dilatation and curettage and sent for acid-fast bacilli culture and staining. No acid-fast bacilli were detected. Pipelle endometrial biopsy revealed tubercular endometritis. Endometrial tissue showed granulomatous inflammation with necrosis. Epithelioid cells formed granulomas with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells around them. Langerhans' giant cells were also recognized. The result of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive in the endometrial tissue samples. Anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) was initiated. A 6-month course was given, comprising 2months of quadruple therapy consisting of isoniazid (5mg/kg), rifampicin (10mg/kg), ethambutol (20mg/kg) and pyrazinamide (25mg/kg), followed by four months of maintenance treatment consisting of a daily double-agent therapy of isoniazid (5mg/kg) and rifampicin (10mg/kg).

The diarrhea was associated with abdominal discomfort and it occurred up to 5 times a day. He referred non-quantified fever with afternoon predominance, and diaphoresis. He had history of an episode of pancreatitis of unknown etiology 3 years prior to this hospitalization, allergy to ceftriaxone, and a right orchiectomy for non-specified reason. He came from a rural town in Puebla state in Mexico and had a story of ingestion of non-pasteurized dairy products including milk and cheese. He denied prior contact with patients with tuberculosis and has no pets. He has family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and one late uncle with history of non-specified cancer. Previously he had been admitted to another Institution for diagnostic approach, where lab tests were carried out only with alterations in liver function tests with a cholestatic pattern, alkaline phosphatase (AP) 146U/L, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 163U/L, the rest of lab tests were normal. In the same hospitalization, a thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed with finding of a tumor in right colon and cecum, with report of possible malignant characteristics, abdominal and retroperitoneal nodes and a distant lesion in lung with report of probable metastasis, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon was given. He attended to our institution for a second opinion. On examination, blood pressure was 119/62mmHg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, and temperature 36.4°C. Plain chest X-rays were normal. Abdomen was painful at medium compression, and a solid, undefined, immobile, painful mass of 5–6cm of diameter was palpable in right lower quadrant, with no signs of acute abdomen. In the Emergency Department new lab tests were performed with the next results hemoglobin 10.4g/dL, platelets 541×103/ml, leukocytes 6.6×103/ml, glucose 87.5mg/dL, creatinine 0.87mg/dL, total proteins 6.47g/dL, albumin 2.66g/dL, direct bilirubin 0.11mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 20U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 21U/L, AP 125U/L, GGT 106U/L, lactic dehydrogenase 163U/L. A new CT scan was performed with finding of thickened colonic wall in ascending colon, with mediastinal, retroperitoneal adenopathies, bilateral pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly. Therefore a colonoscopy was done. A stenotic, nodular-shaped and ulcerated zone of 25cm approximately was found, with loss of normal morphology, between terminal ileon and cecum (Figs. 1 and 2  ), biopsies were taken. Auramine-Rhodamine stain of the biopsies showed abundant fluorescent acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 3 ). Real-time PCR assay of the biopsies was positive for isoniazid and rifampin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Shortened, directly observed therapy strategy (DOTS) for tuberculosis with ioniazid 300mg, rifampin 600mg, pirazinamid 1600mg and ethambutol 1200mg was initiated. One month after the treatment was initiated, he was re-admitted to the Emergency Department because of intense abdominal pain, cramps, arthralgia and myalgia. The patient had, previous to his admission, an episode of non-bloody diarrhea and vomit of gastric contents. Plain abdominal X-rays showed bowel distention and multiple gas-fluid levels, therefore a CT scan was carried out and bowel occlusion was confirmed. Open exploratory laparotomy was performed with finding of multiple peritoneal implants and an ileocecal tuberculoma; therefore open right hemicolectomy with ileo-transverse anastomosis was completed (Fig. 4 ). He remained hospitalized for 5 days for post-surgical surveillance with appropriate evolution and was discharged, to continue DOTS. ",0
164,S2212553116300711,Pericardial tuberculosis with an emphasis on empiric therapy in endemic areas  for tuberculosis (a case report)," Case Report A 13-year-old female student presented to the urology clinic with fatigue, peripheral edema, dysuria, and hematuria, these symptoms having begun recently. She had a history of renal stone. The urologist ordered an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan with intravenous and oral contrast. In the computed tomography, moderate ascites, right-sided pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion were seen (Fig. 1 ). She was admitted to the Emergency Department of the Shahid Rahimi Hospital of Lorestan, Iran. In the complete history, she reported dyspnea on exertion and weight loss in the past 1month, but she had ignored them. She had no history of cough, chest pain, night sweats, orthopnea, tuberculosis (TB), diabetes mellitus, or immunosuppression. There was no personal or family history of contact with or an infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. She denied any recent chest infection. On physical examination she seemed well and comfortable. She could talk well and answer questions completely. She did not have dyspnea at rest. On examination, at the time of admission, she was stable. Evaluation of the vital signs showed a temperature of 37°C, heart rate 110beats/min, blood pressure 110/80mmHg, and respiratory rate 18breaths/min. Jugular venous pressure was raised. The respiratory sounds were normal in the left hemithorax but were decreased in the right hemithorax. The heart sounds were muffled. Also, she had paradoxical pulse and 1+pitting edema in the lower limbs. Electrocardiogram at the time of admission revealed sinus tachycardia and low voltage of the QRS complex. QRS is the second wave in a normal electrocardiogram and it shows the depolarization of the ventricles of a heart (Fig. 2 ). On the initial echocardiogram, in apical four-chamber view, left ventricular ejection fraction was 65% and good, a 3.6-cm pericardial effusion was seen, and echocardiographic tamponade was detected. Additionally, the right ventricle was collapsed in diastole (Fig. 3 ). Based on the massive pericardial effusion, emergency pericardiosynthesis and thoracoscopic pericardial window were recommended; 2.5L of blood-stained fluid was drained. The result of the pericardial effusion analysis showed a white blood cell count of 5.34×106 cells/L including 5% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 94% lymphocytes, and 1% monocytes, and the red blood cell count was 1.9×109 cells/L. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) in pericardial fluid was 80U/L. Because of the presentation of pleural effusion, thoracosynthesis was recommended. Pleural fluid was exudative and the results of the analysis indicated that the white blood cell count was 4.93×106 cells/L including 7% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 92% lymphocytes, and 1% monocyte. The red blood cell count was 1.398×108 cells/L. In initial blood tests, white blood cell count was 1.11×107 cells/L (differential: neutrophils, 77%; lymphocytes, 15%; monocytes, 1%; and band cells, 7%), hemoglobin was 10.9g/dL and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 51mm/h. Urinary analysis and creatinine were normal. The workup for TB was negative, as were the skin test, acid-fast bacilli smear, and fluid polymerase chain reaction. The histological examination was consistent with the chronic reaction and no granuloma was observed. Pericardial fluid culture was not available. Other causes of pericardial effusion were ruled out. Later in the hospital, the temperature increased to 38°C. Pericardial TB was considered as a clinical diagnosis because of the pleural effusion, ascites, hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, and the systemic symptoms (including weight loss and peripheral edema) and ADA of 80U/L, and lymphocyte dominancy in the pericardial fluid. Standard TB treatment was initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Additionally, prednisolone was added to the therapy. Her clinical condition improved rapidly during the hospitalization. The temperature became normal and pericardial and pleural effusion decreased. The clinical response to the therapy was excellent and she was discharged after 10days. Electrocardiogram at the time of discharge revealed normal QRS complex (Fig. 4 ). The patient’s response to the treatment was excellent. Follow-up echocardiography after 8weeks showed only mild pericardial effusion (0.6cm) with no evidence of constructive pericarditis (Fig. 5 ). Chest radiography was normal. Also the erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased to the normal range (18mm/h). During 12weeks of follow-up, we did not detect any recurrence of symptoms or signs of deterioration. There were no adverse reactions to the drugs observed and she had gained weight. ",0
165,S0929693X18301684,Potentially preventable tuberculosis cases in children exposed to a contaminant case," 2 Methods  2.1 Organization of TB management in France In France, screening of individuals exposed to a case of TB is provided free of charge by dedicated Centers for TB Control, called Centres de Lutte Anti-Tuberculeuse (CLAT). According to national recommendations, all children, up to 15 years of age, sharing the same home and/or having close and repeated contact with a case of pulmonary TB should be screened. If the index case has a negative microscopic examination, screening must be initiated without waiting for culture results. The first visit should take place within 2 weeks of the diagnosis of the index case. During this first visit (V1), a clinical examination, a chest x-ray (frontal view), and an immune test are performed in the exposed children. IGRAs are not recommended for children under 5 years of age. In the absence of initial criteria for a latent TB infection (LTBI), a second evaluation (V2) must be carried out, within 8–12 weeks after the last contact. Immune test and chest x-ray are repeated during this visit. During the interval between V1 and V2, prophylaxis with isoniazid and rifampicin is recommended in all children under 2 years of age and immunocompromised patients. In 2013, these recommendations were simplified in children over 5 years of age. It is now proposed to carry out only one immune test (TST or IGRA), 8–12 weeks after the last contact. All children with LTBI should receive treatment with isoniazid and rifampicin for 3 months. In exposed children, LTBI is defined by a positive immune test, in the absence of clinical and radiological signs. The thresholds for TST are 10mm in children not vaccinated with BCG, and 15mm in those vaccinated with BCG. For IGRA tests, the thresholds considered are those provided by the manufacturers. If clinical and/or radiological signs are present, the diagnosis of TB disease is considered. Children for whom anti-TB treatment is initiated are classified as confirmed TB or unconfirmed TB, according to microbiological results [5]. All cases of TB disease are reported to the CLAT.   2.2 Population of the study This study was carried out with the CLAT in charge of the city of Paris (CLAT75). Data for all children aged 0–10 years, and evaluated by CLAT75 between January 2009 and December 2013, were extracted from the computerized database, and retrospectively analyzed. Thus, data from pediatric TB disease cases as well as data from all of the children screened during this period were available. To take into account age-specific screening guidelines, children were divided into three age subgroups: children less than 2 years of age, for whom chemoprophylaxis is systematically recommended; children 2–4 years of age; and children 5–10 years of age, considered as having a lower risk of progression to TB disease following infection [6]. CLAT systematically referred to pediatric hospital services for children under 2 years of age, and a large part of the 2 to 4 year-old age group. Situations leading to the diagnosis of active TB were divided into discovery at screening, discovery upon symptoms, or discovery on systematic exam. If TB was diagnosed at screening, the following parameters were analyzed: time to V1 after the diagnosis of the index case, time between V1 and V2, performance of immune test and/or chest x-ray, availability of the results for these exams, initiation of a preventive treatment, and dosage of prescribed drugs. This study was approved by Institutional Review Board of the French Society for Respiratory Medicine: (Société de Pneumologie de Langue Française) (CEPRO 2017-010).   2.3 Data analysis Potentially preventable cases of TB were defined as:  • children who had been screened following exposure to a known index case, but at least one screening procedure was noncompliant with national guidelines: time to first visit exceeding 14 days; incomplete evaluation at V1 (no immune test, no x-ray, no TST reading); time to second visit exceeding 3 months after the last contact with the index case; incomplete evaluation at V2 (no immune test, no x-ray, no TST reading); inadequate prophylaxis between V1 and V2 (no prophylaxis given to children less than 2 years of age, inadequate dosage);   • children with TB discovered on the occasion of suggestive symptoms or a routine exam, and for whom a contaminant was actually reported but no screening was initiated.    Continuous data were expressed as median and interquartile range. The difference between groups was tested with a chi2 test with correction of the P-value (Fisher exact test) when the numbers compared were less than 5. A P-value lower than 0.05 was considered significant.  ",0

167,S0385814615000474,Laryngeal tuberculosis: A report of 17 cases," 2 Methods Between April 2009 and March 2013, 1,660 inpatients with tuberculosis were treated at Osaka Prefectural Medical Center for Respiratory and Allergic Diseases. Seventeen of these patients were diagnosed with laryngeal tuberculosis. Criteria used for diagnosis were findings of histologic examination of biopsy specimens (2 patients) or clinical response of granuloma to antituberculosis therapy (15 patients). Patients’ medical records were retrospectively reviewed to obtain data regarding their age, presenting symptoms, site and type of the lesions, and findings of chest X-ray and CT scan, sputum smear, sputum culture, biopsy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and QuantiFERON test (QFT). The distinguishing features of laryngeal tuberculosis will be discussed and compared with those reported elsewhere in Section 4. The data were also analyzed for primary diagnosis, patient's delay (interval between onset of the disease and first visit to a doctor) and doctor's delay (interval between first visit to a doctor and diagnosis as tuberculosis). The data were analyzed with Dr. SPSS II (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and presented as mean±standard deviation (SD). An independent sample t-test was used to determine p-values. Count data were analyzed with Fisher's exact test and p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. ",0
168,S1877056809001704,Patella tuberculosis: A case report," Observation This case is of an 18-year-old, educated woman with no particular history, who had had all the vaccinations and boosters (including BCG) scheduled under the Moroccan public health system. She came from a low-level socioeconomic background, but there was no suspicion of any tuberculosis contagium in the family. Her clinical history, going back two years prior to admission, consisted in inflammatory pain, right knee swelling and limping, accompanied by knee stiffness and flexion contracture. There was no clear feverish syndrome or night sweats, but she did suffer a 2kg weight-loss. Clinical examination was relatively unrevealing, with tenderness on palpation of the medial joint surface of the patella, patellar crepitation, and slight effusion. Mobility was ?5°/0/120°. There was no knee laxity, inguinal adenopathy or other (notably, respiratory) associated signs. On standard X-ray, the lateral view (Fig. 1 ) showed a circumferential rosette form with a light peripheral halo. CT scans (Fig. 2 ) showed a circular image of varying density and well distinguished from the healthy bone, taking up almost all of the medial half of the patellar thickness. Arthroscan, to check patellar joint cartilage integrity, was not performed. There was a lateral shift in the patella, with slight joint effusion. Chest X-ray was normal. Biological analysis found moderate anemia and an inflammatory syndrome: SR=36–105 and CRP=32mg/l. Suggested diagnoses were osteoid osteoma, benign cartilage tumor or Brodie's abscess. The patient underwent open surgery with a medial parapatellar approach and arthrotomy. Joint fluid was sampled. Direct exploration of the medial side of the patella found soft but continuous cartilage on palpation. Inflammatory synovitis in the sub-quadricipital recess was sampled for biopsy. Opening the cartilage revealed crumbly grayish-white tissue, which was entirely removed by curettage, leaving an unfilled bone space over which the joint cartilage was simply laid without suture. Intra-osseous tissue histology confirmed the diagnosis of bone tuberculosis, revealing caseous necrosis surrounded by epithelioid and giant-cell follicles. Synovial biopsy diagnosed non-specific chronic synovitis. The joint fluid contained no BK bacilli; the curettage tissue was not explored for BK. Chest X-ray was normal; three BK cultures proved negative. Tuberculin skin test was positive at 12mm. Antibiotherapy was administered for nine months, following the official Moroccan protocol: two months rifampicin (10mg/kg/d), isoniazid (5mg/kg/d) and pyrazinamide (25mg/kg/d), followed by seven months rifampicin and isoniazid. Plaster cast immobilization was maintained for four weeks. Familial contagion survey proved negative. Short-term evolution was good, with improved knee function and normalized SR and CRP levels. Knee X-ray showed gradual filling of the curettage bone space. The patient was re-operated on three years later for medial femoropatellar conflict associated with an osteophyte on the medial edge of the patella where curettage had been performed (Fig. 3 ). The conflict area was trimmed and the medial osteophyte was dissected. There were no macroscopic signs of recurrence of infection. The final six-months’ result was good, pain-free and with complete knee mobility (0/0/135°). Knee X-ray showed no femorotibial or femoropatellar joint narrowing or alterations to the tibia or femur.

171,S1988885617300615,Ankle tuberculosis. A case in childhood," Clinical case We present the case of a patient who consulted initially at 22 months. The patient had been born in Spain and had not presented with any risk factor for the appearance of the disease. The family's socio-economic situation was good. In the clinical interview we were told that neither the patient nor anyone in his close environment had travelled to endemic TB regions. He presented with swelling and pain in the right ankle, a limp, and in the lower right limb in external rotation. Three weeks previously he had been diagnosed with an ankle sprain and the ankle had been immobilised for 2 weeks. All X-rays, analytical and rheumatic studies tested normal. A MRI of the ankle was taken which only showed non-specific synovitis, with no clear diagnosis being made. Analysis and rheumatic tests were normal. One year after symptoms began and due to their persistence, we decided to perform a synovial biopsy and the outcome was TB of the ankle joint. X-rays were made of the chest and any lung involvement was ruled out. Antibiotic treatment was initiated (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 9 months and relief orthosis for 3 months. The patient was asymptomatic at 4 years of age and the infection resolved. At 9 years of age ankle mobility was almost complete, but atrophy of the triceps surae muscle and retraction of the Achilles tendon was noted. The EMG was normal. Surgery was performed for an enlargement of the right Achilles tendon with shifting to improve walking. After immobilisation and subsequent physiotherapy the patient improved, although a pain on the anterior side of the right ankle persisted and was controlled with anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient was re-assessed at 12 years of age due to limitation of movement. X-rays with both ankle loads revealed destruction of the articular surfaces of the tibia and astralagus, with osteophytes and involvement of the articular space (Fig. 1 ). The MRI showed TB sequelae, but with no active synovitis (Fig. 2 ). Arthroscopy of the ankle was performed, with anterior arthrolysis of the joint, resecting the fibrous tissue and anterior osteophytes. The patient is currently 22 years of age. In the last MRI study TB sequelae appeared (Fig. 3 ) but he leads a normal life despite this. He is a student and aware of his physical limitations. He swims and cycles and knows he should not run or jump. He occasionally takes anti-inflammatory drugs and has periodic check-ups. ",0
172,S1268773111000725,Multifocal bone tuberculosis: A case report," 2 Case report A 60-year-old Moroccan woman presented with pain of distal segment of the left leg for about 3 months which progressed recently to the proximal segment of the right leg. There was no history of injury. The pain had progressively worsened and became unrelieved by salicylates and analgesics. The patient complained for weight loss with at least 10% in just 3 months and had no known recent exposure to tuberculosis or other mycobacterium. There was no history of cough, haemoptysis, expectoration, urethritis or dysuria. Past history of major illnesses was absent and the family history was non-contributory. The patient was conscious, afebrile with normal vital signs. The physical examination revealed a painful little swelling over the distal end of the left leg, diffusely tender and without erythema. The overlying skin was intact. The right leg examination was normal on inspection, while deep palpation over the upper one-third was painful. Knee and ankle joint examination were unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed inflammation with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 80mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 32mg/L, platelet count of 110,000/ml and white blood cell count of 8000/ml. Serum electrolytes were normal. The renal and liver function tests were also normal. The tuberculin skin test (TST) and HIV serology were negative as well as serology for hepatitis B and C. Sputum and urine cultures for tuberculosis showed no growth. Blood cultures were also negative. Chest radiograph was normal. Radiographs showed a well-delineated lytic area in each tibia, distal left and proximal right without periosteal reaction (Figs. 1 and 2  ). There was no evidence of sequestration or articular involvement. Bone scan showed two focus of increased uptake in both tibias corresponding to lytic lesions shown on radiographs. Clinical and radiographic features were suggestive of pyogenic infection, Brodie's abscess, multiple bone cysts, metastases or multifocal giant cell tumor. Tumor markers such as CA125, CA 19-9, and AFP were all within normal ranges and also computed tomography of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis were all normal. The surgical exploration of the distal end of left tibia permitted drainage and evacuation of an intraosseous abscess with caseous necrotic material (Figs. 3 and 4  ). Curettage of the residual bone cavity was performed (Fig. 5 ). Direct examination and culture on Lowenstein–Jensen medium were negative. Fungal and routine bacterial cultures were also negative. The histopathology report showed epithelioid granulomas and giant-cells with caseous necrosis suggestive of tuberculosis with no evidence of tumor or malignant cells. Our patient was from a tuberculosis-endemic area and based on her clinical presentation, laboratory and radiological and findings, a presumptive diagnosis of multifocal skeletal tuberculosis was made and chemotherapy was started including Isoniazid 300mg (H), Rifampicin 450mg (R), Ethambutol 800mg (E) and Pyrazinamid 500mg (P), daily initially for two months (RHEP), followed by a seven-month course of two drugs (HR) and tolerated these medications without any significant complaints or side effects. After 3 months of treatment, clinical signs of healing included a decrease in pain and swelling and a gain in weight were noted. At the end of the nine-month treatment period, X-ray of involved area showed bone regeneration and repair of osteolytic lesions. The clinical response to the antituberculous chemotherapy supported the diagnosis of tuberculosis. After the cessation of therapy, in one year follow up the patient did not have any evidence of recurrence. ",0
174,S2405579417300049,"Factors affecting tuberculosis case detection in Kersa District, South West Ethiopia"," 2 Method  2.1 Study area and period The study was conducted at Kersa District from June to July 2012. Kersa, one of the 17 Districts in the Jimma zone, is located at 22?k.m to the southeastern part of Jimma town and 357?k.m from the capital city of the country, Addis Ababa.   2.2 Study design Facility based cross sectional study design involving both quantitative and qualitative method was used. Quantitative method was used for medical record review and qualitative method was used to explore contemporary phenomenon of the service in its real-life context with multiple sources of evidence. Then, the findings of quantitative investigation was harmonized with and explained by qualitative findings.   2.3 Sample size and sampling techniques The sample size for patient's folders review was determined using single population proportion formula. The assumptions: Level of confidence 95%, 5% margin of error, and P is the proportion of compliance of HCWs to national TB guideline to diagnose. Since there is no study done on compliance of HCWs on national TB guideline on study area, p?=?50% was taken to have maximum sample size. Based on these assumptions the calculated sample size was 384. Consecutive patient's folders containing TB suggestive symptom were drawn from central card room retrospectively, until the required sample size met. Qualitative data was collected with the in-depth interview. In general 18 in-depth interviews were conducted 16 in HCs and two in the District health office; 4 heads of HCs, 4?TB unit focal persons, 4 clinicians and 4 laboratory technicians, one TB unit coordinator and one head of the District health office Analysis: quantities data was analyzed with the help of Microsoft excel 10, and qualitative data was analyzed in content wise and summarized thematically.

175,S1201971208016950,Splenic tuberculosis: a case report," Case report The medical history of a 47-year-old non-diabetic, non-smoking male from a middle-class family in northern Iran with a rural background revealed that his wife had TB three years previously and was completely cured. The patient complained of pain in the left hypochondriac region without cough, hemoptysis, weight loss or fever. Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged and tender palpable spleen. Routine investigations (i.e. hemogram and chest X-ray) were normal, except for an elevated ESR (50mm/hr using Wintrobe's method). PPD was positive (>10mm) and bone marrow examination was normal. There were no laboratory findings indicating immunodeficiency or HIV; the HIV serologic test was negative and CBC was normal. However, an abdominal CT scan showed diffuse lesions and multiple micronodules in the spleen, although the chest CT scan was normal. On the basis of radiological investigations, the provisional diagnosis was a possibly malignant mass in the spleen. Because the spleen was enlarged and at risk of rupture, the use of fine-needle aspiration was excluded and a splenectomy was carried out. Moreover, preoperative diagnosis of TB of the spleen is difficult to establish and acid-fast stains of aspirates can be unremarkable. 2,3  Gross examination of the specimen revealed that the spleen size was 18.5×13.5×8cm and the weight was 860g. The outer surface was creamy brown and multinodular; the many nodules were mainly at the convex surface. The slashed section showed multiple nodules coalescing to form a yellowish-white mass of solid consistency. Hemotoxylin and eosin stained sections of a nodule showed large areas of caseation surrounded by multiple granulomas of epitheloid cells and Langhan's giant cells throughout the splenic pulp. The surrounding splenic parenchyma was within normal limits (Figure 1 ). However, acid-fast staining showed the existence of numerous acid-fast bacilli (Figure 2 ). A part of the spleen was processed for microbiology and PCR to rule out the possibility of mycobacterial infection. The specimen was minced in sterile saline. The minced tissue was used to prepare smears that were then stained by the standard Zeil Nelson staining technique. The remaining tissue was subjected to the standard phenol chloroform DNA-extraction process and cultured. 4  The extracted DNA was then amplified. PCR was carried out using IS 6110 insertion sequence based primers, giving a 390bp product. 5  The amplified DNA revealed the 390bp product, indicating the existence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Figure 3 ). M. tuberculosis was grown after 40 days in Lowenstein–Jensen medium. The lymph node biopsy contained a few connected nodes of a creamy brown color and firm consistency, with a total size of 2×1×0.4cm. A hemotoxylin and eosin stained section of a lymph node showed chronic granulomatous lymphadenitis, but no typical caseation. Acid-fast staining failed to reveal any acid-fast bacilli in the lymph node sections. Immediately after the splenectomy, oral antituberculous treatment with four drugs was started (isoniazide 300mg/daily; rifampin 600mg/daily; pirazinamide 1.5g/daily; ethambutol 1g/daily) for two months and continued with two drugs (isoniazide 300mg/daily; rifampin 600mg/daily) for four months.

176,S134462231730425X,Coronary artery tuberculosis: An unusual case of sudden death," 2 Case report The deceased was a 37-year-old man who had allegedly been a drug user until six weeks before being found dead in his bed. His HIV status is unknown, and he had not complained of chest pain or constitutional symptoms of tuberculosis before death. Under the Inquest Act of South Africa, this sudden unexpected death was investigated, and the body subjected to a medico-legal post-mortem examination.  2.1 Post-mortem examination External examination was unremarkable. The deceased’s body mass index was 19?kg/m2 and there were no signs of injury or stigmata of drug use, including needle track marks. The chief post-mortem findings included oedematous lungs and a critically occluded left coronary artery, with approximately 90% luminal stenosis (Fig. 1 ). This obstruction was confined to the left coronary artery from its ostial origin to the division into the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The peri-arterial tissue was markedly firm on palpation. The other coronary arteries were patent and free of macroscopic atherosclerotic disease. There was no pericardial effusion and no enlarged periaortic or mediastinal lymph nodes were identified. Tissue samples from the lungs and heart were taken for histological examination.   2.2 Histological findings Sections of the myocardium showed subtle hypereosinophilia of the myocytes with contraction bands. There was mild perivascular fibrosis, with no subendocardial fibrosis in the sections examined. A dense lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate was noted within the ventricular epicardium, with superficial extension into the underlying myocardium. In addition, extensive chronic inflammation involved the epicardial fat at the root of the aorta, with numerous lymphocyte aggregates demonstrating reactive germinal centre formation. The aortic valve was unremarkable; however the adjacent aortic adventitia was expanded by extensive necrotising granulomatous inflammation containing scattered Langhans-type giant cells (Figs. 2 and 3  ). The adjacent aortic media showed coagulative necrosis, without significant intimal thickening. Similarly, the left coronary artery was encased by necrotising granulomas, which focal medial destruction (Fig. 4 ). There was marked fibrointimal proliferation with associated luminal obliteration, in areas also affecting the intramural arterioles (Fig. 5 ). An isolated, non-occlusive atherosclerotic plaque was also noted in the proximal left main coronary artery. Hilar lymph nodes showed reactive follicular hyperplasia, however no granulomatous inflammation was present. The lung tissue showed mild pulmonary oedema and congestion of alveolar capillaries, in keeping with agonal cardiac failure. There was no evidence of concomitant pulmonary TB. Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) and Wade-Fite (modified ZN) histochemical stains, performed on tissue sections of the coronary arteries, were negative for acid- and alcohol fast bacilli. However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was detected via a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, performed on the paraffin embedded cardiac tissue.   2.3 Cause of death Toxicological examination was negative. The manner and cause of death was thus determined to be natural, due to coronary artery occlusion secondary to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.  ",0
177,S144395060700039X,Tuberculosis of Thymus—A Case Report," Case Report A 19-year-old male presented with nonexertional chest pain of 3-month duration. There was no history of cough, fever or recent weight loss. He gave history of completely treated pulmonary tuberculosis in childhood. Clinical exam was normal; his haemoglobin and ESR were within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed superior mediastinal widening but no calcification. There was no pleural or pericardial effusion. Computerised tomographic (CT) scan of thorax showed an anterior mediastinal mass with adhesion to chest wall, anterior segment of upper lobe of left lung, pericardium, arch of aorta and main pulmonary artery. Alfa foeto protein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) levels were within normal limits. A CT guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done but was inconclusive. Hence, a possible diagnosis of thymoma, lymphoma, secondaries or tuberculous lymphadenitis was considered (Figures 1 and 2  ). He was taken up for open biopsy. A median sternotomy was done. There was no chest wall adhesion. A 6cm×4cm×3cm mass arising from left lobe of thymus was seen, adherent to pericardium and upper lobe of left lung. There was no intrapericardial extension. It was moderately vascular. It was dissected out and excised. The raw area on lung was repaired with pledgetted suture. Frozen section suggested thymoma and showed no malignant cells. Routine histopathology revealed caseating granulomas and langhans giant cells within the thymic tissue confirming diagnosis of tuberculosis. Patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on seventh postoperative day. He was started on antituberculous chemotherapy. At 6-month follow-up, patient is asymptomatic. ",0

Two weeks before admission, the patient had undergone appendectomy for perforated appendicitis, and after the operation abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed in order to search for an intra-abdominal abscess. Initially the patient had normal kidney function and she had no prior history of renal or pulmonary disease. She said that her mother had a history of tuberculosis. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy and pretibial edema. On pulmonary auscultation, there were rhonchi in the middle zone of the left lung. Blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and examination of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and urogenital systems were unremarkable. Urine output was 3600 mL/24 h on the first day of admission. Laboratory examination showed hemoglobin 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit 37.2%, white blood cell count 11,000/mm3, platelets 298 × 103/?L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 41 mm/h, C-reactive protein 68.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 81 mg/dL, serum creatinine 5.7 mg/dL (glomerular filtration rate 9.2 mL/min by modification of diet in renal disease formula), potassium 6.0 mEq/L, serum albumin 2.8 g/dL, total protein 6.17 mg/dL, and activated partial thromboplastin time 26.8 seconds. Urine analysis yielded 3+ erythrocytes on strip and proteinuria 75 mg/dL. Twenty-four-hour urine collection showed protein excretion 9.8 g/24 h, urine microalbumin 1980 mg/24 h, urine creatinine 1204 mg/24 h and creatinine clearance of 17.4 mL/min. Renal ultrasonography showed bilateral kidneys with normal size and shape, but increased parenchymal echogenicity. Markers for immune-associated nephrites [antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-dsDNA, antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody] were negative. Renal biopsy showed crescent formation in 14 out of 27 glomeruli and there was diffuse linear staining of immunoglobulin G deposits (Fig. 1 ). There were no granulomas and Langhans' giant cells. The sputum and urine culture produced a negative result for mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest X-ray image showed bilateral upper lobe opacities compatible with pneumonic consolidations, which was more prominent in the left lung (Fig. 2 A). Chest CT confirmed this pneumonic consolidation (Fig. 3 ). We diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis based on the findings of chest CT and examination of sputum, which was positive for acido-resistant bacilli (ARB). Considering the presence of nephrotic syndrome and crescent formation, we started intravenous methylprednisolone pulses of 500 mg/day for 3 days, and then methylprednisolone was continued orally at a dose of 64 mg/day. Four-drug antituberculosis treatment was also administered after having seen ARB positivity. After 2 months of immunosuppressive and antituberculosis therapy, renal function repaired, plasma creatinine level decreased from 5.7 mg/dL to 1.4 mg/dL and the pulmonary symptoms also responded to the treatment (Fig. 2B).

She suffered from cough and hemoptysis for longer than 48-h. The patient’s main complaint was pain in the left side of her chest, and she did not present with any other types of pain. Upon physical check-up, no breath sound was heard in the left hemi-thorax. The period of bleeding was long, and the platelet count was 10,000perml3. The other clinical parameters such as white cells count, hemoglobin, liver function test, urine test and ECG were normal. The X-ray film and CT scan of chest showed infiltration and bronchiectasis in the left lower lobe with cardiac and mediastinal shift being observed (Figs. 1–3   ). To remove the clot, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia was performed. Then, due to patient’s resistance to platelet infusion, the platelet infusion was converted to Novoseven infusion. For definitive diagnosis, more complementary examinations were performed, i.e., sputum samples were investigated for the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Based on the positivity report of smear and culture, the patient received Isoniazid (INH), Rifampin (RF), Pyrazinamid (PZA) and Ethambutol (ETB) for anti-TB treatment. However, as the level of liver enzymes increased and hepatotoxicity were observed, the drug regimen was changed to INH, ETB and Ciprofloxacin (Cip). After taking this regimen, the liver enzyme levels returned to normal status. The patient received this regimen for 12months.

He had no comorbidities. Laboratory tests revealed C-reactive protein (CRP): 18mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 24mm/h, and white blood cells (WBC): 6460×103 mm3. A diagnosis of seronegative arthritis was made and deltacortril 4mg 1*1 and salazoyprin 500mg 1*1 was administered. During the follow-up period, pain was relieved but redness and swelling remained. In 2013, an wrist X-ray was performed (Fig. 1 ), which revealed soft tissue density increase, soft tissue swelling, and periarticular osteoporosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 2 ) showed millimetric and nodular images in flexor group tendon sheath in T2A series and wrist images were consistent with synovitis. The patient was referred to our department. On March 19th, 2013, right wrist synovitis resection and flexor retinaculum release was performed. Multiple rice bodies around the wrist flexor tendons were seen during the operation (Figs. 3 and 4  ). Specimens were sent to microbiology and aerobic-anaerobic cultures and liquid media remained sterile. The patient’s symptoms regressed after the operation. However, in the postoperative 6th month, symptoms of right hand volar pain, swelling, and redness started. Laboratory tests and MRI findings showed recurrence. The patient underwent surgery again on November 11th, 2014, using the same incision line. There were multiple rice bodies again (Fig. 3). Flexor tendons were widely debrided. Perioperative specimens were sent to pathology and microbiology. A tuberculosis culture was analysed in addition. Pathologic examination showed granulomatous synovitis and the microbiologic examination in Lowenstein Jensen medium revealed M. tuberculosis. There was no history of lung tuberculosis. After thorough debridement, antituberculosis therapy was administered and maintained for twelve months. After completion of antituberculosis therapy, there was no wrist pain and redness. Wrist range of motion was full. Laboratory tests revealed CRP: 1mg/L, ESR: 2mm/h, and WBC: 6600×103 mm3. Wrist X-ray in the control visit (Fig. 5 ) showed that soft tissue density decreased and swelling disappeared. Wrist MRI (Fig. 6 ) revealed that synovitis findings were fully recovered. ",0

Primary pulmonary TB should be distinguished from postprimary pulmonary TB, which is the most frequent manifestation of TB in adults (70%–80% of cases). 2  The host inflammatory reactions play an important role in protection from this disease as well as its pathology. 3  In the initial stage of M. tuberculosis infection, additional macrophages and other immune cells aggregate with the infected cells to form granulomas, the morphology of which is characterized by a central necrotic core surrounded by concentric layers of macrophages, epithelioid cells, multinucleate Langerhans giant cells, and lymphocytes. 4  A balance between pathogen replication and the immune response is established, and the lesions move into a latent state in most patients. Only in certain situations, such as immune dysfunction, does primary TB occur. Secondary TB involves the reactivation of the dormant bacteria and accounts for most cases of TB. TB-infected tissues can be damaged through a variety of mechanisms, including low oxygen tension and a restricted nutrient supply. 5,6  If patients with TB are not diagnosed and treated appropriately and in a timely manner, the disease can cause serious damage to the body and even death. 7,8  ",0

DST for clofazimine had been carried out using the MGIT method 10  at a concentration of 0.5 ?g/mL. Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra (ATCC 25177) were used as the QC strains.   Drug stock preparation Clofazimine powder (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was diluted with DMSO to prepare a stock solution with the concentration of 10,000 ?g/mL. Duplicate vials sets were then prepared using either DMSO (CLO-DMSO) or distilled water (CLO-DW) to further prepare working stock solutions of 41.5 ?g/mL. All vials were stored in the dark, at –80oC, for up to a month. Sample vials were retrieved after a week to compare the appearance of the drug solutions.   Parallel DST to show the impact of using water versus DMSO as the final diluent The 11 clinical isolates that were initially tested as resistant to clofazimine were re-tested with CLO-DMSO or CLO-DW using the MGIT method. In addition, parallel DST was also set up using QC strains on six different occasions using two separate lots of working stock preparations. On each occasion, two sets of H37Rv and one set of H37Ra were tested. In the drug tube, 100 ?L of either CLO-DMSO or CLO-DW was added to a 7 mL MGIT with 0.8 mL of oleic acid dextrose catalase (OADC). A 0.5 MacFarland suspension was made of each clinical isolate and a 1:100 dilution suspension was prepared in normal saline, following the manufacturer's instructions. 11  Then 500 ?L of the undiluted organism suspension was inoculated into the drug tube, and 500 ?L of the 1:100 diluted suspension into the growth control tube. The tubes were incubated in the BACTEC MGIT 960, and monitored and interpreted with TB eXIST software.   WGS to confirm susceptibility to clofazimine Genomic DNA was extracted by ethanol precipitation and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) from 11 initially-resistant clinical isolates. Whole genome sequencing library was prepared using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) and pair-end sequenced on the HiSeq2500 or MiSeq instruments (Illumina, USA) with at least 50x coverage. The sequence reads were mapped onto the H37Rv reference genome, where the candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using SAMtools mpileup, with SNPs filtered to remove those at sites with a mapping depth less than 10% of the mean sequencing depth. SNPs at sites with heterogeneous mappings were filtered out if the SNP was present in less than 75% of reads at that site. Non-synonymous genetic mutations were searched for in the four genes known to be associated with clofazimine resistance: Rv0678, Rv2535c, Rv1979c and atpE.   Inhibitory effect of DMSO on the growth of M. tuberculosis  Ten-fold final concentrations of DMSO were incorporated into 7 mL MGIT broths containing 0.8 mL of Middlebrook OADC enrichment, resulting in final concentrations ranging from 0 to 10% (Table 2 ). The same volume of media was removed prior to addition of DMSO to ensure the volume in each tube was consistent at 7.8 mL. H37Rv was grown in a MGIT tube and when the culture turned positive, an aliquot was removed and diluted in normal saline to make a 0.5 McFarland suspension. Each MGIT tube containing DMSO was then inoculated with 500 ?L of this suspension and incubated in the MGIT 960 system. The time-to-positivity was defined as the number of days from the point of incubation to the point of detection of growth by the MGIT system.   Effect of 1.2% DMSO on the growth of clinical isolates and QC strains A convenience sampling of eight different clinical isolates and seven H37Rv QC strains were tested against 0.5 ?g/mL of CLO-DMSO (final concentration of DMSO in each drug tube being 1.2%). In addition, an extra MGIT tube containing 1.2% DMSO was inoculated with a 1:100 dilution of organism suspension and included for each DST set.  ",0

All of the six patients presented hoarseness and came to our clinical for treatment during January 2015 to January 2016. Both Epidemiological and clinical parameters were collected. Epidemiological parameters included age, gender, as well as identification of the risk factors presumed to induce or facilitate the onset of LTB. Clinical parameters included the patient's symptoms, signs, nasopharyngeal flexible endoscopy findings and systemic signs of TB. All patients, whose clinical examination and chest X-ray indicated active lung infection, were considered as having pulmonary TB. In this case, antituberculosis chemotherapy was initiated right after confirmation of diagnosis. ",0
192,S2213007117302228,Evaluation of coexistence of cancer and active tuberculosis; 16 case series," 2 Methodology We retrospectively reviewed data from the recorded files of patients between the years of January 2009 and December 2014. We collected demographics data (age, gender occupation), clinical features and laboratory results (sputum smear microscopy, culture, sensitive test for mycobacterium tuberculosis, tuberculin skin test (TST), histopathotology, the location of TB and cancer, the ways diagnosis of TB cases, risk factors, TB treatment results of cases from medical records of cases with the coexistence cancer and active TB. All registered patients were evaluated. This study was approved by The Department of Tuberculosis Control at Ministery of Health (number 147 Date 10/March/2015). Patient’ informed consent was not required because of the study was retrospective. ",0
193,S2405579416300353,A rare case of chronic otitis externa due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis," Case presentation A 68-year-old male was referred to Otorhinolaryngology at Mayo Clinic in July of 2014 for persistent left ear drainage that began approximately 3 years ago. He was otherwise healthy and without any constitutional symptoms. In 2013, a tympanoplasty was performed due to persistent drainage, followed by a revision tympanomastoidectomy in January of 2014. Unfortunately, his hearing did not improve and the drainage continued. Two separate bacterial cultures that were obtained had no growth. He received eardrops ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% and betadine without resolution of his symptoms. On his presentation in 2014, his ear examination revealed mild myringitis, posterior ear canal thickening, and drainage. The tympanic membrane was intact. The diagnosis of external auditory canal atopic dermatitis was initially entertained and he was prescribed Tacrolimus- neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and hydrocortisone otic solution otic suspension. He had moderate improvement in symptoms approximately one month later. Attempts to wean him off daily Tacrolimus- neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and hydrocortisone otic solution otic suspension resulted in acute exacerbations of mild pain and ear drainage. Laser myringoplasty for chronic myringitis was recommended. In October 2014, laser myringoplasty on the left side was performed, but the patient had developed severe external auditory canal granulation tissue that was worrisome for squamous cell carcinoma, and consequently, multiple deep biopsies of the external canal were obtained along with debulking of granulation tissue. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections showed reactive squamous epithelium with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (Fig 1 ). Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain was positive for many acid-fast bacilli (Fig 2 ) while Grocott's methenamine silver stain was negative for fungal organisms. There was no evidence of any dysplasia or squamous cell carcinoma. Real-time PCR of the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was positive for M. tuberculosis complex. Additionally, an acid-fast stain performed on a swab collected from the left anterior ear canal was negative, but grew acid-fast bacilli at 13 days in Middlebrook broth cultures (BACTEC MGIT 960, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) that was identified by nucleic acid hybridization probe (AccuProbes, Hologic GenProbe, Bedford, MA) as M. tuberculosis complex. Real-time PCR to determine the species within the M. tuberculosis complex was performed as previously described [4] and identified the growth from the 7H11 biplate subculture as M. tuberculosis. Culture of the swab on solid media (7H11) biplate grew dry, rough, nonchromogenic colonies after 15 days that were acid-fast with cording by Kinyoun stain. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using the Bruker MALDI Biotyper (Bruker Daltonic, Billerica, MA) and version 3.1 software and mycobacteria database 2.0 identified the isolate as M. tuberculosis complex with a score of 2.193. Furthermore, two additional surgical specimens, 1 swab from the left ear and tissue from the biopsy of the left ear were culture positive for M. tuberculosis complex. The finding of M. tuberculosis from the ear specimens was surprising and the patient was then evaluated by an Infectious Diseases specialist. The patient denied any cough, fever, weight loss, or hemoptysis. He lived most of his life in the Midwest with travel only to Florida in the winter and without any travel outside of the continental United States. He is a retired teacher. He denied any known TB exposure or history of incarceration. He does not recall having testing for latent tuberculosis (i.e. purified protein derivative (PPD) or gamma interferon release assay testing) in the past. His laboratory findings including a complete blood count, liver function testing and creatinine were normal. HIV serology testing was negative. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube testing was positive (tuberculosis antigen value 11.97 IU/mL). His chest x-ray showed no abnormalities. Three induced sputa performed at an outside hospital were negative by acid fast smear. A separate induced sputum collected at our facility was negative by acid-fast smear, but mycobacterial culture grew two colonies of M. tuberculosis after 36 days. A CT scan of the head from a different institution performed on November 2013 and June 2014, were reviewed by our radiologist and revealed diffuse narrowing of the left external auditory canal, opacification of the left middle ear and mastoid air cells, and destructive changes involving lateral left mastoid air cells (Fig 3 ). The mastoid area had been previously debrided elsewhere and involvement at the time of presentation was thought to be limited to the soft tissue of the external auditory canal. Treatment for extrapulmonary TB was initiated with rifampin 600mg daily, isoniazid 300mg daily, pyrazinamide 2000mg daily, and ethambutol 1600mg daily for 2 months. After 2 months, the ethambutol and pyrazinamide were discontinued, as the isolate was pan-sensitive. The plan was to treat with a 12 month course of isoniazid and rifampin. This is not the standard length of treatment—which would be 6 months. We extended the duration to 12 months because his course was complicated with recurrent otorrhea after initial improvement on therapy. We wanted to rule out recurrent TB or identify an alternative explanation. Repeated biopsy of the external ear canal and multiple subsequent mycobacterial cultures were performed and were negative for M. tuberculosis, however they grew Stenotrophomonas. This was thought to be a secondary infection of the external ear canal requiring the addition of oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% eardrops to his antimicrobial regimen. His otorrhea eventually resolved and his ENT exam normalized. ",0
195,S2213007117300345,Miliary tuberculosis in a patient with tuberculous mycotic aneurysm of the abdominal aorta: Case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 84-year old man of Greek origin, retired farmer and former smoker, with a possible history of tuberculosis in his childhood, was admitted to hospital with low-grade fever and febrile episodes up to 38.5 °C, with concomitant weight loss of about 12Kg during the last 3 months. The clinical examination did not reveal any focal symptoms, while the chest radiograph was normal. Apart from an ESR of 100mm/1h, no remarkable findings resulted from the rest of the laboratory and imaging tests. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and the virological control was also negative (RPR, EBV, CMV, TOXO, HIV, HBV, HCV, echo virus, coxsackie, parvo B19). Immunological tests (ANA, ANCA, RF, C3, C4, immunoglobulins) did not provide any abnormal findings. In order to investigate the patient's fever, a chest CT scan was performed, which did not reveal significant findings in the lungs, apart from fibrous tissue in both apices (Fig. 1 a and b) while an abdominal CT scan revealed a sacciform aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and soft tissue at the level of the left renal artery. No vertebral infection was detected and the differential diagnosis included mass, abscess and inflammatory lesion. The patient was then submitted to placement of intraluminal stent, during which no biopsy was performed. Transesophageal echocardiography, fundoscopy, temporal artery biopsy and the thyroid gland biopsy were all normal. Moreover, a radioisotopic study performed with labeled autologous leukocytes did not detect any focus of abnormal concentration around the stent in the abdominal aorta, suggesting absence of inflammation in the area. Finally, the mantoux skin test was measured at 17mm. The patient received piperacillin/tazobactam and teicoplanin and then imipenem for a cumulative period of 20 days, and afterwards he was discharged from the hospital without being totally aferile. One and a half months later he was readmitted suffering from fever up to 39 °C for ten days and cough with mild expectoration. He showed signs of weakness and enfeeblement as well as mild confusion and disorientation in time and space. New chest X-ray and CT-scans were performed, the findings of which indicated miliary tuberculosis and presence of opacities in both upper lobes (Fig. 1c and d). A new abdominal CT scan revealed increased size of the soft tissue in 3.5 × 2.4 × 5 cm and expansion to the ipsilateral psoas muscle (Fig. 2 a and b). The head CT scan was normal and the patient did not consent to lumbar puncture. On the basis of the new imaging findings, tuberculosis was strongly suspected and the patient was transferred to the Pulmonary Department. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, but the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, the molecular test for M. tuberculosis of the bronchial lavage, as well as sputum and urine samples, were negative. However, 10 days later the liquid culture (Bactec Mgit) of bronchial lavage proved positive for M. tuberculosis and the patient was started on a 4-drug regimen with rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. A few days later a needle biopsy of the mass located behind the aortic aneurysm was performed under CT guidance. The biopsy showed no signs of granulation tissue. However, the molecular test for M. tuberculosis rRNA was in the gray zone and the Löwenstein-Jensen culture of the tissue block eventually proved positive. The strain was sensitive to all first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. The patient received anti-tuberculosis treatment for 9 months (2 months rifampicin - isoniazid - ethambutol - pyrazinamide & 7 months rifampicin - isoniazid) which he completed without experiencing any side effects. During treatment he showed an impressive improvement of his clinical condition. Fever remitted completely, he regained his body weight (about 10Kg in 9 months), became functional and fully oriented. The final ESR decreased to 35mm/1hr. A significant improvement in his chest and abdominal CT scans was also noted (Fig. 1e and f and Fig. 2c and d). ",0
196,S2213007115300101,Pulmonary tuberculosis masking lung cancer – A case report," 2 Discussion Bayle in 1810 was the first to report on the co-existence of pulmonary tuberculosis and bronchogenic carcinoma [7]. Fontenelle et al. reviewed 90 patients over a 12 year period who had co-existent bronchogenic carcinoma and pulmonary tuberculosis. Seventy-one patients (78.8%) had active tuberculosis. One third of the 90 patients underwent thoracotomy and lung biopsy for diagnosing cancer [8]. Ting et al. proposed several plain radiographic features which should increase the suspicion of coexisting lung carcinoma in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis the foremost of which was progression of pulmonary infiltrates while the patient was on anti tuberculosis drugs as was seen in our patient [9]. In a study to identify factors causing delay in diagnosis of lung cancer, Chandra et al. found that of 123 patients with lung cancer, 23 (17%) had been labeled initially as suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. But of the 23, only 3 had bronchial wash positive for tuberculosis [10]. In our case we had initially isolated AFB using ZN staining from the bronchial wash which was subsequently negative with treatment. Our patient was a male smoker who had symptoms of bronchorrhea but was not dyspneic despite extensive disease. He also had the diffuse infiltrative variety of BAC which is a less common form of presentation and has a poorer prognosis. Wu et al. [11]. proposed the theory of ‘reverse causality’ which explains that occult lung cancer may provoke reactivation of latent TB infection by weakening host immune mechanisms and the lung cancer is usually diagnosed in the 6–9 months of TB treatment.

197,S2052297517300859,"Genotyping and molecular detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis among tuberculosis lymphadenitis cases in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"," Materials and methods  Patients' recruitment and study settings A cross-sectional study was conducted on culture-positive cases from July to October 2014 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital and Alem Tena Higher Clinic, these sites were purposely selected because more patients with TBLN were referred to them. A total of 65 isolates were included to analyse the gene responsible for MDR-TB in relation to its molecular genotyping at the Ethiopia Public Health Institute. This institute is well-known in Ethiopia for conducting research and the molecular TB research centre is part of it. To this effect, demographic data were collected from all patients using a pre-structured questionnaire by trained clinical nurses. Patients on anti-TB treatment and <18 years old at the time of sample collection were excluded.   Sample collection and processing Fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples were collected by a pathologist from the affected nodes. Briefly, the swollen area was cleaned with 70% alcohol and then a 21-gauge needle was inserted into the mass. After removing the needle, drops of aspirate were placed on a clean slide for FNA cytology, thereafter, leftover FNA samples were added aseptically into sterile universal tubes in PBS, pH 7.2, at 4°C.   Mycobacteriological culture Samples suspected of TBLN were processed and cultured at the Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology TB laboratory. Briefly, FNA specimens were homogenized and mixed with 0.85% normal saline and decontaminated by shaking in an equal volume of 4% NaOH for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the specimens were subjected to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes. After homogenization, 100 ?l of the sediment was inoculated into the conventional Lowenstein–Jensen egg slant medium, containing 0.6% sodium pyruvate. The cultures were incubated at 37°C in a slanted position for 1 week and in the upright position for 4–8 weeks. the same media. Culture of the specimen was incubated at 37°C for 3–8 weeks. The media were checked for evidence of bacterial growth daily for the first week and weekly for the rest of the time until 8 weeks. Microscopic examination of the colonies was performed using Ziehl–Neelsen stain to select Acid Fast Bacilli positive isolates. Heat-killed cells were prepared by mixing two loops of colonies in 200 ?l distilled water and thereafter heating at 80°C for 1 h. The heat-killed cells were used for molecular characterization. To check for the quality of the Lowenstein–Jensen medium, a fast-growing mycobacterium complex strain was run in parallel with each batch of inoculated media. In addition to this, uninoculated Lowenstein–Jensen tubes were incubated at the same time to control for contamination.   Spoligotyping Spoligotyping was carried out using a commercially available kit from Ocimum Biosolutions (UK) described earlier [10]. To put it briefly the direct-repeat (DR) region was amplified with primers DRa and DRb. Then, the amplified DNA was denatured and the single-stranded DNA was hybridized with 43 spacer oligonucleotides covalently bound to a membrane. For running spoligotyping the already published procedure was followed [11]. DNA from Mycobacterium .bovis, bacillus Calmette–Guérin and M. tuberculosis H37Rv were used as positive controls, whereas Qiagen water (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used as a negative control. The presence of spacers was visualized on film as black squares whereas the absence of spacers was indicated by white squares following incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase and they were detected by the enhanced chemoluminescence system detection liquid (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). Spoligotype patterns of each strain were prepared in binary and octal format and entered into the recently released international spoligotyping database SITVITWEB [12] for detecting their spoligotype International Type (SIT) numbers. Strains for which SIT numbers could not be recovered from the database were considered orphans. Lineage and sublinage designation were according to SPOTCLUST at http://tbinsight.cs.rpi.edu/run_spotclust.html. All the steps of sample processing and PCR were carried out in a separate PCR mix room using dedicated pipettes and autoclaved tips to prevent cross contamination. To make sure of the quality control, recent standard operating procedures for each step were followed.   Line probe assay The MTBDRplus assay was performed directly on sputum samples and according to the manufacturer's instructions [13] at the Ethiopia Public Health Institute-TB research unit. A 500-mL portion of decontaminated FNA samples was used for DNA isolation; subsequent amplification and hybridization were based on manufacturers' recommendations [13] Each step was carried out in a separate room with unidirectional workflow between rooms. After hybridization, test strips were allowed to dry before being attached to the paper. Each strip consisted of 27 reaction zones (bands) including controls that were interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions to determine test validity, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex identification, and resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin. An internal quality control program with positive and negative controls was implemented during the study.   Statistical analysis All demographic and laboratory data were entered, checked and analysed using SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The categorical data were analysed using the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test that assumes when expected value less than 5 cells. A p-value ?0.05 was considered statistically significant.

198,S2212553115001612,Does intensified case finding increase tuberculosis case notification among children in resource-poor settings? A report from Nigeria," Materials and methods  Intervention design A prospective, community-based intervention was carried out in six states in southern Nigeria from 1st July 2013 to 30th June 2014.   Intervention setting The states in southern Nigeria were stratified according to three geopolitical zones, namely south–south, southeast, and southwest zones. The states included Akwa Ibom and Rivers (south–south), Enugu and Ebonyi (southeast), and Ogun and Lagos (southwest). Two states were randomly selected from each of the zones. To select the “control” states, the states were stratified into the same three geopolitical zones, and then two states were selected from each zone. As a community-based intervention, control states were selected to match the intervention states in most respects, except for the intervention. The control states were Cross River and Edo (south–south), Anambra and Imo (southeast), and Ondo and Ekiti (southwest). In each intervention state, all tertiary and secondary healthcare facilities were selected.   Target population The target population consisted of children younger than 15years in the intervention states. These included 2,133,036 children, 1,155,418 children, 2,020,671 children, 4,866,546 children, 1,745,071 children, and 2,821,443 children for Akwa Ibom, Ebonyi, Ogun, Lagos, Enugu, and Rivers, respectively, giving a total of 14,742,185 children. This accounted for 47.6% of the total population within the intervention areas. To obtain baseline data that included complete cohort reports of all children treated for TB in the intervention and control states at the time the research protocol was developed in 2012 (Table 1 ), the data for 2011 were used as the baseline. For comparison, the proportions of children younger than 15years in the six control states were computed (Table 2 ). All children (<15years old) who presented with signs and symptoms of TB at the participating health facilities were eligible for inclusion in the study. All children (<15years old) living with a confirmed smear-positive TB patient (whether HIV positive or negative) at the time of treatment were also included in the study.   Healthcare facilities Each of the intervention states had an array of healthcare facilities, including publicly-owned healthcare facilities, faith-based non-profit-oriented healthcare facilities, and for-profit private healthcare facilities. These facilities fall into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. The study was designed to take place in both healthcare facilities and in the homes of registered smear-positive TB patients who were receiving treatment and had children residing in same households. Five healthcare facilities were purposely selected to include facilities that attend to the highest number of children in each state. Thus, a total of 30 healthcare facilities were selected. Within each facility, the intervention was undertaken in every unit where children were attended to, including the children outpatient clinic, children emergency room (CHER), general outpatient department (GOPD), anti-retroviral (ART) clinic, and the TB directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) clinic.   Intervention strategies The intervention was divided into two main phases: the preparatory phase and the ICF and treatment phase. During the preparatory phase, advocacy meetings were held with key stakeholders, including the National Coordinator of the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP), the State TB and Leprosy Control Officers of the selected states, heads of healthcare facilities/paediatricians in the selected hospitals, and heads of state school health boards. To increase awareness of childhood TB among community members and healthcare workers, 6000 handbills were produced and distributed to parents of children accessing care in hospitals, school children, and community members. A total of 1500 posters were also produced and distributed in the communities, healthcare facilities, schools, and markets. Over 20 visits were carried out to primary schools in order to provide health education concerning TB. One thousand copies of flip charts (work aids) were produced and distributed to the healthcare workers. Other work aids produced and distributed were 600 copies of flowcharts and 6000 copies of growth-monitoring charts. Additionally, 5000 units of purified protein derivative for tuberculin skin testing (TST) were procured and distributed. Training was done to improve the knowledge and skills of healthcare workers in identifying presumptive childhood TB cases, appropriately diagnosing and treating confirmed cases. Key healthcare workers who were trained included 120 medical officers/paediatricians and 150 nurses other general health workers (GHWs). The training also included how to use various tools, including WHO score charts, flip charts, flowcharts, and growth-monitoring charts. To complement the job of the healthcare workers in the intervention, 38 ad hoc workers were recruited, trained, and posted to the selected healthcare facilities. Their training included how to use the screening form to verbally assess if a child had any of the symptoms and signs of TB. Given the ubiquitous presence of patent medicine vendors (PMVs) and the anecdotal evidence indicating that they are usually the first point where community members seek care, they were also integrated into this intervention. Thus, 90 PMVs were trained to identify presumptive child TB cases and instructed in the appropriate use of tools given to them. In the ICF phase, three ICF strategies were used: ICF at outpatient clinics, ICF through contact tracing, and ICF at ART clinics. Nurses/GHWs and ad hoc workers used the screening forms to identify presumptive TB cases. The screening form contained seven features (symptoms and signs) of childhood TB, including, fever for ?2weeks, weight loss/failure to thrive, cough of ?2weeks, night sweats, swelling of the lymph nodes, abdominal/bone/joint swelling, and swelling of the back/angular deformity. The presence of any feature carried a score of 1. A score of ?1 suggested that a child was a presumptive TB case and therefore required further assessment by a nurse or medical officer/paediatrician. In the TB DOTS clinics, GHWs and TB supervisors provided health education to registered cases with co-resident child(ren) younger than 15years. Those who gave consent were visited at home, where screening forms were used to assess for symptoms and signs of TB. Again, a score of ?1 identified a child as a presumptive TB case needing diagnostic attention. In summary, three key ICF strategies were used: ICF at outpatient clinics (screening of children at various outpatient clinics), ICF through contact tracing (screening of children coresident with known TB cases in their homes), and ICF at ART clinics (screening of children living with HIV at ART clinics). Identified presumptive cases capable of producing sputum samples were guided on sputum production. However, with the permission of the NTBLCP, only two samples produced at least 1-h apart were used. The samples were processed using Ziehl–Neelsen smear/alcohol-fast bacilli microscopy. Diagnosis of TB in children who could not produce sputum or who presented with features of EPTB was challenging. To help overcome this challenge, clinicians used the Keith Edwards child TB score chart (adopted by WHO in 1996). The score chart is a diagnostic tool that takes into consideration a combination of clinical and investigative characteristics in order to arrive at a diagnosis by assigning numerical scores to the absence or presence and degree of severity of clinical characteristics. These characteristics include duration of illness, nutritional status of the child, family history of TB, TST, unexplained fever and night sweats, lymphadenopathy, joint/bone swelling, abdominal mass or ascites, central nervous systems affectation, and angle deformity of the spine. Children who scored ?7 were further evaluated by a paediatrician or experienced medical officer trained in TB diagnosis. All investigations, including smear microscopy, X-rays, and TST, were provided at no cost to the children. Apart from children who were screened for TB at the ART clinics, since their HIV status was already known, other presumptive TB cases were offered HIV counselling and testing, alongside their parents/caregivers.  Tuberculosis treatment Children who were confirmed as having TB were initiated on a full course of anti-TB drugs under full observation of their treatment. They were monitored and followed up in line with NTBLCP guidelines. Children who tested HIV positive were referred to the ART clinic for HIV care, treatment, and support.    Data collection Tools were developed for the monthly collection of data at the facility and local government levels. Each unit in the intervention hospitals was also provided with standardised registers, which were filled with data from the screening forms. Ad hoc staff and nurses/GHWs also retrieved relevant data from the hospital case folders and updated the screening forms and registers at their units. On a monthly basis, they collated their data and completed the monthly reporting forms. These were validated by the local government TB and Leprosy supervisors, who then sent the reports to the State TB and Leprosy Control Programme (STBLCP) office, where the STBLCP Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) team carried out further data validation.   Statistical analysis Data were double-entered into the database and cross-checked by two independent M&E officers. Data analysis was done using Epi-Info version 3.4.1 (Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to compute the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the detected cases, as well as targets, indicators, and yields of each of the key case-finding strategies. Further analyses were done using the chi-square test to compare proportions. A trend analysis was undertaken to demonstrate the pattern of changes in case detection in the 3years before and during the intervention in both the intervention (evaluation population) and control states (control population).   Ethical approval The study complies with international guidelines for research and was approved by the Ethics and Research Advisory Committee of the State Tuberculosis Control Programme, Ministry of Health, Ebonyi State, Nigeria. The intervention was also approved by the Central Unit of the National Tuberculosis Control Programme, Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja, Nigeria. Approval was also obtained from the management of each of the healthcare facilities where the intervention was implemented.

200,S2213007117303064,Massive hemoptysis from Rasmussen's aneurysm in active pulmonary tuberculosis; A case report of successful treatment with bronchial artery embolization," 2 Case report A 63-year-old male, never-smoker, alcoholic and a known diabetic and hypertensive, was admitted to our hospital with a 7 days history of low-grade fever and cough with expectoration and recent development of mild hemoptysis, two days prior to admission. He reported no weight loss. His vitals were stable and chest radiograph revealed left upper lobe cavitating lesion. Flexible bronchoscopy was done which showed bleeding from the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe. His postbronchoscopy sputum and bronchial washings were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). One day after admission, the patient developed an episode of massive hemoptysis of more than 400 mL that later continued amidst resuscitative measures. He was adequately resuscitated. CTPA (Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography) was done, which showed an aneurysm measuring 8.6 × 7.3 mm along the apical segmental branch of the left upper lobar pulmonary artery suggestive of Rasmussen's aneurysm. Dense consolidation in the apicoposterior and lingular segments of the left upper lobe-probably secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage and thick-walled cavities in the apical segment of left upper lobe were also noted. (Fig. 1  & Fig. 2 ). His hemoptysis further worsened and an urgent attention of interventional radiologist was sought. He underwent emergent embolization procedure. Initially a 5F cobra catheter was used to catheterize the right bronchial and intercostal arteries. These runs appeared unremarkable for any abnormal findings. Left bronchial artery had to be catheterized with Mikaelson catheter, this run revealed significant blush in the left upper zone with associated pseudoaneurysm. Microcatheter was used to obtain purchase distally into the largest branch of the left bronchial artery. The runs were reviewed to rule out any significant spinal vascular contribution before injecting PVA particles. PVA particles of 500–700 ?m mixed with saline and contrast were injected under subtracted fluoroscopy. Angiogram revealed absent parenchymal blush and non-opacification of the previously detected aneurysm. (Fig. 3  & Fig. 4 ). Check angiography of the serial intercostal arteries on either side did not reveal any significant bronchial supply. The left subclavian artery, left internal mammary artery, the cervical branches of the left subclavian artery were angiographically assessed and they appeared unremarkable for significant supply to the left upper lobe cavitary lesion. Post procedure, there was no further hemoptysis and patient's clinical status improved. He was discharged with instruction to continue antitubercular therapy as advised. Patient completed treatment course for six months. He was followed for more than a year and half from discharge and there was no further recurrence of hemoptysis. ",0
203,S0303846714001954,Spinal tuberculosis at the posterior element of spinal column: Case report," 2 Case report  2.1 History and physical exam A 60-year-old woman presented with low back pain, a hump on her upper back and 1 month difficulty in ambulation. She complained of numbness on her right calf and foot after walking and could not particularly tolerate the supine position. 2 years prior to the case consult, she underwent vertebroplasty of the L2 due to an osteoporotic compression fracture. 14 months prior to the case consult she subsequently underwent a corpectomy of L1 and L2 with application of anterior cage L1–L2, posterolateral fusion (PLF) and posterior fixation (PF) from T11 to L4 with the diagnosis of a burst fracture of L1 and cemented L2 secondary to fall (Fig. 1 ). At that time, she had no sign of infection, including fever, leukocytosis and erythema on the operative scar. Histopathological evaluation revealed degenerative disc and fibrocartilage. There was no history of TB exposure, no recent weight loss, low-grade fever, decreased appetite or night sweats. On physical examination, fever was not detected. Cough and sputum were also not present. Her breath sounds were clear. Palpation revealed no enlargement of the lymph nodes. Neurologic examination revealed that motor function in both extensor hallucis longus muscles was decreased to a grade of 4/5 and sensory function in touch was decreased in the right L5 dermatome.   2.2 Laboratory examinations Laboratory studies revealed normal hemoglobin and white blood cell count. However, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 115, reference 0–9.0mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP; 38.7, reference 0–4.0mg/dl) level were significantly elevated. All other examinations, including biochemistry, were within the normal range. Both Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and purified protein derivative (PPD) tests were negative. Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as fungal infections, spinal brucellosis or tuberculosis were included in the differential diagnoses; however, the patient recalled no history of such diseases or close contact with a tuberculosis patient in the past.   2.3 Radiological findings Further image analysis with chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound revealed normal findings. Plain radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 with osteolytic changes in the L4–L5 facet joint (Fig. 2 ). Comparing of previous radiologic images, computed tomography scan revealed posterior displacement of the screws, radiolucency around the screws and osteolytic lesion at the right L4–L5 facet joint (Fig. 3 ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast revealed an extradural dorsal mass with rim enhancement and dorsal thecal sac compression at the L4–L5 level (Fig. 4 ). In addition, the presence of the paraveretebral abscess was strongly suggestive of the possible diagnosis of the spinal/vertebral infection (Fig. 5 ).   2.4 Operation For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, a posterior laminectomy with abscess drainage was performed at the L4–L5 level and biopsy specimens were taken. An anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) was also performed from L2 – S1 and PLF and PF from T9 to the ilium due to pseudarthrosis with instrument failure. Intraoperatively, the right L5 pedicle and lamina were eroded and fragile. Granulated tissues tightly surrounded the right L4 exiting nerve root and L5 traversing nerve root. The dura mater expanded well after removal of the mass. Histopathological evaluation showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseation, which is characteristic of TB (Fig. 6 ). TB-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in the mass was positive for M. tuberculosis. The definitive diagnosis was revealed by histopathological examination of the extradural mass in the spinal canal along with the result of TB-PCR in the lesion. A urinalysis to detect possible urinary tract coinfection was negative.   2.5 Postoperative course The patient's symptoms had improved much after the operation. She remained symptom free 3 months after surgery. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Meanwhile, antituberculous combination therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) was given to the patient for 12 months, starting on the 1st post-operative day. Up to the writing of this report, the patient has recovered and is living a normal life.  ",0
204,S2210261214002995,A case of isolated splenic tuberculosis," 2 Presentation of case A 27 year old African American male presented to the emergency department with epistaxis for three days. He had associated generalized weakness, anorexia, unintentional 50lb weight loss, and night sweats. His history was significant for 10 years incarceration; he was released five months prior to this admission and his health subsequently deteriorated with regards to weight loss and fatigue. Physical exam revealed a cachectic, afebrile man with a tender abdomen and hepatosplenomegaly. His blood work was remarkable for platelet count of 8000, AST 59, alkaline phosphatase 606 and LDH 388. HIV ELISA was negative. He was admitted with a working diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. On his first hospital day, PPD was placed and was negative. He was started on IVIg at 0.5mg/kg. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of abdomen and pelvis showed splenomegaly with diffuse heterogenous enhancement and innumerable lesions, as well as diffuse lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis, splenic hilum, retroperitoneum and pelvis. Homogenous hepatomegaly without focal hypodensities was also noted (Fig. 1 ). CT of the chest showed 1.9cm left lung lower lobe nodule with irregular margins, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were present. Whole body PET scan was performed to evaluate for lymphoma and metastatic disease and showed splenomegaly with hypermetabolic FDG activity, with hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy in mediastinum, retroperitoneum, mesentery and pelvis. Bone marrow biopsy was performed and revealed megakaryocytic hyperplasia. On day three of IVIg treatment he showed no major improvement and therapy with decadron initiated. On fifth hospital day, his platelet count was less than 5000 and he was subsequently given platelet transfusion and evaluated by surgery for splenectomy. On seventh hospital day, a repeat CT of the abdomen showed significant gastric varices and portal hypertension. Splenectomy was performed due to failure of medical management. The splenectomy was approached via laparotomy due to the preoperative evidence of gastric varices. Operative findings were significant for large hepatosplenomegaly and highly-vascularized splenic ligaments. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by fungemia; he was treated and discharged home. The weight of the spleen was 1430 grams and it measured 33×18×8cm. On gross appearance, the surface of the spleen was irregularly nodular and brown (Fig. 2 ). The entire spleen was replaced by caseating granulomas and necrotizing-type granulomatous inflammation (Figs. 3 and 4  ). Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria were seen by AFB stain. Splenic hilar lymph nodes with non-caseating granulomas were also visualized. ",0
205,S166557961630062X,Case report: Intestinal tuberculosis with perforation of the colon and psoas abscess associated with Escherichia coli ESBL," Clinical case The patient was a 17-year-old female without any relevant medical background. Six months prior to her admittance she presented backache and limitation in the flexion of the thigh, which was treated with NSAIDs without any improvement. She presented intermittent fever and leucorrhea in the last couple of months and abdominal pain in the last two days. She refers to a 12-Kgs weight loss. During physical examination, her temperature was 38°C, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, a respiratory frequency of 26 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 100/60mmHg, abdominal pain in lower quadrants of the abdomen, and data of peritoneal irritation. The labs report 12g/dl of hemoglobin, 16K/?l of leukocytes and 2.1g/dl of albumin. A pelvic ultrasound is conducted, reporting a left tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic cavity collection. A CT scan is performed, reporting a left tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic cavity collection as previously described in the ultrasound (Fig. 1 ), reactive retroperitoneal lymph nodes, abscess in the left psoas muscle (Fig. 2 ) and L2–L3 spondylodiscitis. She is moved to the operating room in order to conduct an exploratory laparotomy and granulomatosis lesions are found in the peritoneum, colon and small intestine (Figs. 3 and 4  ), the omentum migrated to the pelvic cavity, and a perforation of the cecum and the proximal part of the ascending colon (Fig. 5 ) was found, as well as a left ovarian-tube abscess, 50cc of a purulent aspect liquid and fecal matter in pelvic cavity. Samples are sent to be studied; the left psoas muscle is exposed, 60cc of purulent material is debrided and drained and sent for culturing; a right hemicolectomy, ileostomy, transverse colon mucocutaneus fistula and a left salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Retroperitoneal adenopathy transoperative biopsy is sent, reporting a chronic granulomatous process compatible with tuberculosis. Drainages are placed in the pelvic cavity and retroperitoneum. Gram staining results report abundant polymorphonuclears and moderate Gram bacilli (?) and negative BAAR staining. Cultures reveal Escherichia coli ESBL (extended spectrum beta lactamas) resistant to all 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, including cefepime and aztreonam, but sensitive to imipenem. Pathology results show a granulomatous chronic salpingitis, granulomatous chronic peritonitis, ulcerated and perforated cronic granulomatous colitis. A sputum smear microscopy and culture are performed, reporting negative BAAR staining and a culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The viral panel was negative. The patient was administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (imipenem) as well as an anti-tuberculosis drug. A lumbar magnetic resonance is conducted, confirming the L2–L3 spondylodiscitis diagnosis. The Orthopedic Department decides on a conservative management. Postoperative evolution is positive, and the drainages are removed on postoperative day 7 after presenting a little serous exudate. The intravenous scheme is completed and hospital discharge is decided to continue with an ambulatory anti-tuberculous treatment and a follow-up consultation in order to program the ileostomy closure.

206,S221444201630211X,Renal Tuberculosis in a 9 Months Old: Case Report and Review of the Literature," Case report A nine months old girl was referred to the pediatric department with prenatal diagnosis of bilateral hydronephrosis and dilatation of right ureter due to a bilateral double system associated to bilateral megaureter. She was otherwise healthy and asymptomatic. The general examination was unremarkable. The serial urine microscopy showed more than 100 leukocytes per ?l and the cultures resulted positive for Klebsiella oxitoca. Serum investigations were normal. Renal ultrasonography showed bilateral double system with bilateral megaureter associated to hydronephrosis of superior hemisystem and parenchyma atrophy more significant in the right kidney. Filling cistourography demonstrated right vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) to the lower right hemisystem and intravenous urography did not disclose further findings (Fig. 1 ). Diuretic renogram revealed an important difference in renal function: right kidney 6% and left kidney 94% (Fig. 2 ). In view of the presumed diagnosis of right functional annulment, a right laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed and the anatomopatological result was chronic granulomatous pyelonephritis suggestive of tuberculosis. The patient had no suffered from TBC in the past nor contact with a patient suffering from TBC. Immunization with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) had not been administrated. With the histopathologic diagnosis of renal TBC (Fig. 3 ) the patient was subjected to further investigations. The chest CT presented with lesions compatible with lung TBC, Mantoux test showed a mildly positive reaction (15 mm induration) and urine PCR was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient's mother was also studied and had no evidence of disease. Postoperatively, the child received antituberculosis therapy (ATT) for a full 8 months and the follow-up renal ultrasonography and urography revealed improvement of ureterohydronephrosis in left kidney.

211,S026643561730801X,Tuberculosis: the great imitator in the head and neck - our experience of 24 cases in 22 years," Patients and methods We retrospectively reviewed the casenotes of all 24 patients with confirmed TB of the head and neck who were treated by one surgeon in the Head & Neck Department, Doncaster Royal Infirmary, Yorkshire & Humber region, England, from July 1993-April 2015. Routine investigations consisted of both relevant radiological and serological testing, including (in a few cases) interferon gamma release assay for TB infection. Patients with a mass in the neck had fine-needle aspiration (ultrasound-guided or otherwise), with cytological and microbiological examination including staining for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl-Neelsen stain). Cultures of sputum and ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging films were reviewed, depending on the clinical presentation. Biopsy specimens of suspect tissue (lymph node or otherwise) and drainage fluid from incised lesions were cultured and analysed histopathologically. These data, in addition to personal and clinical details, the presenting complaint, findings on examination, reports of investigations, together with treatment and its duration, were recorded on a proforma. Data were assessed with the aid of SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA), and descriptive statistics were used. The significance of differences between correlations among nominal variables was assessed with Fisher’s exact test. The primary continuous outcome variable was patients’ duration of follow-up (days) in the head and neck outpatient clinic. Predictive variables were patients’ immune state, inflammatory markers on admission, causative mycobacterium, and antimycobacterial regimens given. Patients with drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and HIV infection were regarded as immunodeficient, while the rest were immunopotent. Inflammatory markers recorded were: white cell count, c-reactive protein concentration, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients infected by M tuberculosis were allocated to one group, whereas and patients infected by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (M avium complex, M kansasii, and M malmoense) were allocated to the other. In this study our respiratory colleagues used three antimycobacterial regimens: rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide; rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol; and rifampicin and isoniazid. Shapiro-Wilk test (p<0.01) together with inspection of normal Q-Q plots showed that duration of follow up was non-parametrically distributed between the groups. To compare scores between the three groups we used the Kruskall-Wallis test, as the distribution of the outcome variable was skewed, and there were more than two predictive groups. To compare scores among all the other groups we used the Mann-Whitney U test, as again the distribution of the outcome variable was skewed, but this time there were two predictor groups. Probabilities of less than 0.05 were accepted as significant. ",0

216,S1567134818306294,"Improving diagnosis and case management of patients with tuberculosis: A review of gaps, needs and potential solutions in accessing laboratory diagnostics"," 2 Recent approaches and their impact on ending the global TB epidemic In the absence of a 100% effective vaccine for TB with which 25% of the global population is currently infected, halting the TB transmission chain and progressing toward a world free of TB must concentrate on early detection and adequate management of every individual developing the disease (Fig. 1). The complexity of diagnosing M. tuberculosis is reflected in Fig. 2  below, capturing the need to detect and distinguish latent TB infection (to prevent progression to active TB), active TB disease, drug resistant TB and response to treatment. None of these can be achieved without an affordable and effective diagnostic component that includes an efficient laboratory network and readily accessible point-of-care testing. An effective diagnostic laboratory must go beyond the shortcomings of the oversimplified “one size fits all” directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) TB control strategy. Under DOTS, only patients with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy positive sputum were treated (Anon., 1999), assuming that only these patients posed a major public health threat. DOTS patients were easily diagnosed through smear microscopy, which is accessible for most patients. However, DOTS has failed to account for the low sensitivity of smear microscopy and therefore resulted in underdiagnosis. It became clear that a new low-cost screening technology to replace smear microscopy was needed at the community level, to improve access to diagnosis much closer to patient populations. A second weakness of DOTS has been that both culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) were restricted only to cases that were still AFB microscopy positive after two months of treatment to confirm viability and rule out drug resistance, assuming that only a limited number of these cases would be drug resistant. This lack of information on the drug susceptibility patterns and resulting inadequate treatment and follow-up of TB patients has played a key role in contributed to the global epidemic of drug resistant TB. The urgency of developing, optimizing and introducing novel TB diagnostics is accelerating substantial progress in research and development of new TB diagnostic tools over the last decade. A variety of new techniques are shaping the field: light-emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy for more sensitive smear microscopy; liquid culture for rapid M. tuberculosis complex detection and DST; molecular line probe assay for rapid screening for MDR; and fully automated, cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification assay GeneXpert MTB/RIF to detect drug susceptible and rifampicin-resistant TB. These novel TB diagnostic technologies have contributed significantly to the improvement of TB control in low-burden high-income settings, which are now progressing toward TB elimination. In these settings, which have clear advantages in economic and infrastructure resources, it has been easy to support adoption and utilization of new technologies and provide adequate personalized treatment to each individual with TB. In LMICs however, the availability and scalability of these new diagnostic tools has been much slower; many of these high-burden settings continue to rely heavily on smear microscopy. Key barriers to implementation and routine utilization of novel diagnostics in LMICs can be attributed to weaknesses in sample referral/transportation systems which impede scalability. Other challenges include low implementation rates for planned non-procurement related activities, inadequate equipment maintenance plans, low utilization rates and scaling of existing equipment such as GeneXpert due to low staffing levels. Expensive infrastructure requirements are necessary to support existing liquid culture technologies, a significant financial burden for countries who are then forced to limiting their use to central and district/regional levels. There have been high expectations for the GeneXpert MTB/RIF technology (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, USA), a fully automated closed system that performs sample preparation and real-time PCR, and producing results in <2?h. This system is capable of detecting M. tuberculosis complex while simultaneously detecting rifampin (RIF) resistance (targeting the rpoB gene) (Anon., 2014c). While GeneXpert has made some important contributions, it doesn't fully address all the requirements for high-burden LMICs to achieve the greatest impact and cost-effectiveness (Hanrahan et al., 2015). The test is primarily sputum-based and the specimen preparation is adequately simplified, to work effectively with raw sputum. However additional specimen collection is needed to confirm drugs resistance by growth detection (because pre-treatment for GeneXpert testing kills M. tuberculosis). The technology has the advantage of being cartridge-based but the reagents are temperature sensitive. Despite the fact that the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) negotiated a price for a four module machine at approximately US$ 17,000 and the Xpert MTB/RIF tests cost approximately US$ 17 per cartridge (Albert et al., 2016; Lemaire & Casenghi, 2010; Van Rie et al., 2010), these prices are still high and the instrumentation requires additional expensive calibration and maintenance. In addition, the throughput is inadequate for high-burden LMICs (12–14 samples per working day) and the External Quality Assurance has not been adequately addressed. The test presents adequate sensitivity on smear positives, and acceptable sensitivity on smear negatives, with a good specificity to detect M. tuberculosis complex. However, the performances for detecting RIF resistance show various problems such as lack of detection of certain forms of acquired drug resistance because the system needs the mutated population to be almost 100% to detect the mutation, the prediction of RIF resistance in paucibacillary samples and for a few rpoB mutations types has resulted in both false-positive and false-negative results, and there is no information on the type of mutation (Chakravorty et al., n.d.; Hanrahan et al., 2015). Variables that may affect the tests overall performance include HIV prevalence, strain diversity, prevalence of specific drug resistance-conferring mutations, patient-related diagnostic delays and default rates (Van Rie et al., 2010). The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay has the potential to be used in moderately equipped laboratories, however, it is unlikely to be used as a Point of Care (POC) diagnostic test in most peripheral settings, primarily due to poor infrastructure and limited resources. To date, it has been mainly implemented at district level with low penetration in the tiered diagnostic network; its impact has been moderate, increasing the number of confirmed cases but not the number of new cases detected (Hanrahan et al., 2015). Line probe assays (LPAs) were endorsed by the WHO in 2008 for molecular detection of drug resistance from smear positive patients at risk of MDR-TB (Anon., 2008). Two available commercial LPAs are currently recommended by WHO: the Geno-Type MTBDR plus test (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) and the Nipro Assay (Nipro Corporation) (Pai et al., 2009). Hain Lifesciences specifically designed to test for resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs (fluoroquinolones, ethambutol, aminoglycosides and cyclic peptides), and which can be used in combination with the Geno-Type MTBDR plus test to identify XDR-TB (Brossier et al., 2010; Hillemann et al., 2009; Kiet et al., 2010). WHO analysis of systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed that LPAs are highly sensitive (97%) and specific (99%) for the detection of RIF resistance, alone or in combination with isoniazid (INH) (sensitivity 90%; specificity 99%), on isolates of M. tuberculosis and on smear positive sputum specimens. The major advantage of LPAs is that they can be performed directly on smear positive sputum samples, giving rapid (approximately 5?h) drug susceptibility results without the need for culture. However, the disadvantages of LPAs include being labour-intensive and requiring highly trained personnel and dedicated laboratory space and equipment (Nicol, 2010). This makes deployment of LPAs a challenge in high proportion of TB diagnostic centers within LMICs. Recently, WHO conditionally recommended the use of loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) as a low complexity nucleic acid amplification test suitable for use at microscopy and higher-tiered test facilities to diagnose pulmonary TB in adults (Anon., 2016b). TB-LAMP is an isothermal manual DNA amplification with sensitivity higher than for smear microscopy (ranging 77.7% to 80.3%). Among smear microscopy positive patients, TB-LAMP sensitivity ranges from 95.2% to 96.6% across studies, depending on the reference standard used. The specificity of the assays ranges from 97.7% to 98.1%. This assay requires lower biosafety level and the equipment is more affordable than GeneXpert although it still requires electricity and temperature control. Limitations of TB-LAMP include i) it cannot distinguish drug susceptible from drug resistant TB, then it should not replace the use of rapid molecular tests that detect TB and resistance to RIF, especially among populations at risk of MDR-TB; ii) it cannot replace smear microscopy for treatment monitoring; and iii) it is unclear whether it has additional diagnostic value over smear microcopy for the testing of HIV positive patients. Thus, it is not recommended implementing TB-LAMP in settings with high rates of MDR-TB or HIV, or in any setting that is already effectively using GeneXpert. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides a rapid and comprehensive view of the genotype of M. tuberculosis and holds great potential for the rapid diagnosis of drug-resistant TB within a clinically relevant timeframe. Work started recently to intensify on if WGS could provide an alternative tool to replace phenotypic DST and to be applied directly on sputum, and optimized to a field deployable format. WGS provides additionally the highest resolution when investigating outbreaks (Satta et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2017). However, several challenges remain to be solved before WGS can be routinely used in clinical practice and outbreak investigation to guide decision-making, which does not seem to be feasible in the near future. In particular, it is still unanswered how to deal with i) the complexity, throughput and cost of the technology (hardware and software) to perform the tests and to analyze the data; ii) the current discrepancies between genotype and phenotype; iii) the need for large data sets to clarify the role of rare resistance mechanisms and the level of resistance conferred by different mutations; iv) some of the current problems of traditional susceptibility testing, in particular pyrazinamide sensitivity; v) the heteroresistance; vi) the lack of understanding on phenotypic consequences of mutations and compensatory mutations on drug resistance not only on new drugs but also on several of the old TB drugs; and vii) the lack of understanding of these genetic alterations in different geographic settings with different M. tuberculosis lineages/clades. It will be also necessary to solve the need for direct sputum applicability and to optimize for lower levels of the tiered health laboratory systems.  Table 1  below captures major technical limitations in existing TB diagnostics. Whereas low-burden and high-income settings can overcome these limitations (accuracy, turnaround time, complexity) by combining the use of several different tests for each patient, the lack of resources with the complexity of several assays preclude similar success in high-burden countries, especially in LMICs. Collectively, the impact of these new diagnostic methods has been negligible. They have successfully resulted in more accurate diagnosis of the same number of patients with susceptible TB and MDR-TB that were previously diagnosed based on clinical suspicion and limited laboratory confirmation only (by classical smear microscopy and growth detection), but the anticipated high impact in the overall detection and management of TB cases in the field is moderate. As a result, about 4.3 million people living with TB (40% of all estimated TB cases) and 455,000 with MDR-TB (80% of all estimated MDR TB cases) are still missed by health systems every year (Anon., 2016a). In addition to causing excessive suffering and economic hardship, undiagnosed TB and MDR-TB cause sustain TB transmission and perpetuate the epidemic.  2.1 Importance of improved TB diagnostics for drug susceptibility testing in TB A collateral effect of the lack of full (first and second-line drugs) and detailed M. tuberculosis DST and of the complete lack of any DST for novel drugs for all patients detected as MDR-TB is inadequate management of harboring strains with additional resistances. This has resulted into treatment failure, uninterrupted TB transmission, and potential programmatic selection as well as development and emergence of even more resistant forms of TB such as the XDR-TB in South Africa (Müller et al., 2013). In the absence of information and quantitative DST to second-line drugs, only half of the notified MDR-TB cases are cured despite absorbing up to 50% of the TB resources allocated to this patient group alone (Anon., 2014a). A systematic review of clinical outcomes of TB patients treated for different forms of drug resistance in LMICs has highlighted the implications of the oversimplification of present MDR and XDR classification. In the study, overall 62% of patients were successfully treated, in 7% treatment failed or the patients relapsed, 9% died and 17% defaulted (Falzon et al., 2011). Treatment success showed decreasing degrees from MDR-TB only to XDR-TB cases who had the lowest rates of treatment success and the highest rates of failure, relapse and death. This reality demands better access for TB patients in resource-constrained settings to laboratories which can perform DST reliably to detect resistance promptly and provide individualized treatment. Oversimplifying XDR may very well negatively impact the development, utilization, and application of new diagnostics. These risks are compelling factors to develop improved and field optimized diagnostic and case management tools that can achieve universal access in high burden LMICs and support strategies to preserve both existing and new treatment regimens. These strategies need timely and individualized treatment optimization to effectively control acquired or to avoid programmatically generated drug resistance.  ",0

Setting and program description Myanmar is administratively sub-divided into 75 districts, 330 townships, wards, and villages. The Myanmar NTP provides tuberculosis care through township TB centers (TBC) in collaboration with local and international partners. The NTP introduced ACF activities widely with the support of the Global Fund since 2011. The ACF activities have included mobile screening teams with portable digital X-ray machines, setting up sputum collection centers (SCCs) in hard-to-reach areas, community-based TB screening and household contact screening. The Union Office in Myanmar, in partnership with the NTP, has been implementing TB activities since 2005 with a focus on TB-HIV and TB case-finding in health facilities and communities. The PICTS project covers approximately 1.7 million people in six townships in the Sagaing, Magway regions and Shan state of Myanmar. The PICTS project aims to increase case detection and facilitate linkage to care for patients with TB via community-based interventions through community volunteers. Community volunteers were people residing in the project townships who were recruited and trained by the Union and NTP staffs and received an incentive for each presumptive TB case referred and for each activity. The project team, working in close collaboration with the township TB team (Regional officers, TB team leaders, nurses and health assistants), selects “TB cluster” sites within the township to conduct these activities based on case-spot maps. Two ACF interventions (a household and neigbourhood intervention and a community intervention) were implemented by Union field staff (nurses and health assistants) and community volunteers. In the household and neigbourhood intervention, contacts of historical index TB cases >24months ago were screened from July 2014 to December 2016. Project field staff and volunteers obtained addresses of bacteriologically-positive TB patients (diagnosed by smear microscopy or Xpert MTB/RIF) from the township drug-susceptible TB treatment registers from 2012 and 2013 (historical index cases). Index patients with drug-resistant TB were not included in this study. After obtaining permission from the township health authority, the volunteers visited the houses of the historical index TB patients and after obtaining consent, screened household members present at the time of the visit for TB symptoms. In addition, project staff extended the screening process to the people who were living in surrounding houses. The number of surrounding houses that they visited ranged from 10 houses to 30 houses. In the community intervention, project staff or volunteers provided health education (HE) on TB, information on the location of diagnostic centers and where support could be obtained from the project. They distributed Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials and included contacts of volunteers so that the community could get easy access to diagnosis. This was done as either a stand-alone HE session or in conjunction with the township primary health care mobile clinic. Symptom screening was offered to all the eligible participants of both household and neighborhood intervention and community intervention by community volunteers. Presumptive TB was defined as presence of any one of the symptoms including cough for two weeks, blood stained sputum, weight loss, fever, night sweats and neck or axillary glands enlargement. In the event of identification of a presumptive TB case, community volunteers provided sputum cups to them, explained how sputum should be collected and returned the following day to collect the samples and transport it to the township TBC. Two sputum samples were examined for each presumptive TB patient, including one early morning sputum and one overnight sputum sample, using fluorescent microscope. The sputum results were given to presumptive TB patients on day 3 and if the result was positive, a volunteer then accompanied the patients to the township TBC for treatment. Those whose sputum smear was negative but remained symptomatic, or who could not produce sputum or children under 8 years of age were accompanied to the township TBC to obtain a chest radiograph (CXR). A Gene Xpert platform was present in two out of the six project townships and as per NTP guidelines, was used for presumptive TB in people with HIV, contacts of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients, and those with presumptive TB who were previously treated for TB. Diagnosis of TB was made by NTP staff based on either sputum smear, Xpert MTB/RIF or CXR result. The same diagnostic algorithm was used for both interventions and is shown in Figure 1 . TB treatment was provided free of charge by NTP at the township TBC and volunteers were responsible for linking the diagnosed TB patients to treatment.   Study sites The six intervention townships (Sagaing, Monywa, Taunggyi, Kalaw, Yaesagyo and Myaing) were the townships that the PICTS project started in its two ACF interventions: household and neighbourhood intervention and community intervention in July 2014. The seven control townships (Kalay, Tamu, Shwe Bo, Pindaya, Muse, Gangaw and Pwint Phyu) which did not have PICTS projects were chosen based on the similarity of geographical areas and population demographics. Both intervention and control townships have routine passive case finding and public-private mix case finding activities in place during the study period.   Study population The study population included: 1) people screened by either of the two ACF interventions (first objective), 2) TB patients diagnosed under the project (second objective) and 3) aggregated number of all registered TB patients in both intervention and control townships from 2011 to 2016.   Data variables and data source The data variables included: number of people screened, number of presumptive TB patients examined, number of TB patients diagnosed and enrolled in treatment, among the diagnosed TB patients: age, sex, type of TB, site of TB, HIV status and presenting symptoms from six project townships, and TB case notification rate of both six intervention and seven control townships. Sources of data were the presumptive TB register, the township TB register, the monthly project report and the NTP annual report.   Analysis and statistics Aggregate numbers of the reports were in electronic format and maintained by the PICTS project. Data from the presumptive TB register and township TB registers were single-entered by project staff into the Epi info™ Version 7.1.5.2 and MS Excel respectively. Data were exported, combined and analyzed by using EpiData Analysis version 2.2.2.183. Frequencies and proportions were used to describe the screening cascade, demographic and clinical characteristics of TB patients. The screening yield of each intervention (%) was defined as the number of patients diagnosed with active TB from those screened. The number needed to screen (NNS) was used to describe the screening yield from different interventions and number need to test (NNT) was used to describe the diagnosis yield among presumptive TB cases from different interventions. The contribution was calculated by dividing the TB cases referred by volunteers with total registered TB cases in the township and the result was expressed in percentage. The average case notification rate was calculated by dividing total TB cases registered during the intervention period (2011-2013) or control period (2014-2016) by total population in the same periods and expressed in per 100,000 population. In order to assess the effect of ACF on the TB notification rate, we used the following linear model. The expected average notification rate in intervention and control townships, at time period k (ratek)      r a t e  k  = c o n s t a n t +  (   ?   1   *   t o w n s h i p   [ I n t e r v e n t i o n ? O R ? C o n t r o l ]   )  + (  ?  2   *   p e r i o d   [ I n t e r v e n t i o n ? O R ? C o n t r o l ]   ) + (  ?  3   * n u m b e r ? ? o f ? ? y e a r s ? ? s i n c e ? ? 2011 ) + (  ?  4   *   t o w n s h i p   [ I n t e r v e n t i o n ? ? O R ? ? C o n t r o l ]   *   p e r i o d   [ I n t e r v e n t i o n ? ? O R ? ? C o n t r o l ]   )    Where  • ?1 indicates the expected difference in the average notification rates between intervention and control townships at baseline and throughout the study period,   • ?2 indicates the difference in the average notification rates between intervention and control periods,   • ?3 indicates the average change in the TB notification rates per year from 2011 (k=1) to 2016 (k=6) (indicating the underlying secular trend in the notification rates) and   • ?4 indicates the average change in the difference of the TB notification rates per year between the intervention townships and the non-intervention townships in the intervention and control periods (it’s an interaction term between intervention/control townships and intervention/control time periods after adjusting for secular trends).    We used a generalized estimating equation to assess the parameters of the model used to assess the effect of ACF activities on the population weighted average TB notification rates in the intervention and control townships. We assume exchangeable correlation structure within townships and used robust standard error estimates. Assuming that notification rates followed a linear trend, that the intervention townships would have had a similar trend in the notification rates as that of the control townships had they not been exposed to the intervention and that whatever systemic changes (other than the ACF intervention) that have occurred in the intervention townships also happened in the control townships, the coefficient for ?4 can be interpreted as the effect of ACF on the TB CNR in the intervention townships.   Ethical approval Ethical clearance was obtained from Ethics Review Committee, Department of Medical Research, Ministry of Health and Sports, Myanmar and from The Union’s Ethics Advisory Group, Paris, France. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the NTP, Myanmar.  ",0
219,S1516848416300019,Immune thrombocytopenia associated with pleural and pericardial tuberculosis: case report," Case report 60-year-old, previously healthy, Caucasian, male with a history of well-controlled hypertension was admitted to the Emergency Room with new-onset hematuria and generalized purpuric lesions. He also described a two-week history of fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. The patient was well nourished, with generalized nontender, nonpalpable purpuric lesions, most evident in the extremities and trunk. He had an auricular temperature of 37.8°C and a respiratory rate of 22breaths/min. His blood pressure and pulse were, respectively, 109/60mmHg and 110beats/min while supine. Breath sounds were diminished on the right side and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The initial complete blood count revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.8×109/L with 75.4% granulocytes, 13.1% lymphocytes, 11.1% monocytes, 0.3% eosinophils, and 0.1% basophils, hemoglobin of 10.8g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 85.6fl and a mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) of 30.0pg, and platelet count of 2.0×109/L. A peripheral smear was remarkable for a paucity of platelets. The findings of blood chemistries were normal and the following laboratory studies were normal or negative: prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products (FDP), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor, hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Anti-platelet antibodies were not tested. A chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, more pronounced on the right, a large heart shadow and clear lung fields. Computed tomography of the chest revealed massive right pleural effusion and a large pericardial effusion. M-mode and 2D transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an organized moderate-level anterior and posterior pericardial effusion, without right ventricular collapse. The patient was admitted to the Hematology Clinic where he started a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), followed by oral corticosteroid therapy with prednisone (1mg/kg/day orally). The platelet count increased to 243×109/L and platelet transfusions were not required. He was then transferred to our department to evaluate the pleural and pericardial effusions. A laboratory evaluation revealed a normal WBC count, normocytic normochromic anemia and normal platelet count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 88mm/h. The result of tuberculin skin test was positive (22mm). A thoracentesis was then performed, and the pleural fluid revealed glucose 37mg/dL, protein 4.4g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 890U/L, adenosine deaminase (ADA) 90.1U/L, with a WBC count of 8.0×109/L including 66% of lymphocytes and no malignant cells. Pleural fluid acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears were negative but real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was positive, posteriorly confirmed by cultures of pleural fluid with the identification of M. tuberculosis. Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started immediately and the patient was discharged three weeks after admission. Prednisone was tapered over eight weeks and stopped. Four months after discharge, the patient, who was in stable health and with a platelet count of 253×109/L, was found to have abnormal liver enzymes with a cholestatic pattern, thought to be secondary to anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT). Doppler ultrasonography of the liver showed hepatomegaly (176mm), dilated inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, with turbulent flow evidenced by color Doppler and a pulsatile waveform on pulsed Doppler, suggesting right-sided heart failure. A liver biopsy was performed which revealed sinusoidal dilatation and congestion, with no granulomas and no evidence of AFB or malignant cells. Cultures of the liver specimen were not performed. For further clarification, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was then carried out which revealed thickening of the pericardium (6mm) with signs of constriction, but without evidence of pericardial effusion, and the patient underwent pericardiectomy. Thrombocytopenia did not recur during the follow-up. ",0
221,S2213007116300259,A 22-year-old man with pleural tuberculosis associated hydropneumothorax: Case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 22 year-old Asian male smoker presented with ten days of non-productive cough, subjective fevers, night sweats, right-sided pleuritic chest pain and increasing dyspnea. One week prior to presentation, he was empirically treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin without improvement. The patient was an exchange student from China whose last visit home was two months prior to presentation to our facility. Both of the patient's parents had been diagnosed with TB before his birth with unclear treatment status. The patient's physical exam was remarkable for decreased right-sided breath sounds. Vital signs were: temperature, 98.4 °F; heart rate, 102/min, regular; BP, 102/58 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 28/min; oxygen saturation, 95% on room air. Chest radiograph (CXR) showed a large right hydropneumothorax and right upper lobe infiltrate with scarring (Fig. 1 ). A right-sided 32 French chest tube (CT) was placed in the emergency department (Fig. 2 A). A chest computed tomography scan showed tree-in-bud nodularity in the right upper lobe, possible consolidation in the right lower lobe and calcified hilar lymphadenopathy. Additionally, there were foci of gas in the right-sided hydropneumothorax which could have represented a loculated component. Due to imaging findings suggesting prior granulomatous infection and patient history, there was high suspicion for TB and on airborne precautions were instituted. A pleural drainage catheter was placed into the hydropneumothorax. Analysis of the pleural fluid obtained from this procedure revealed: pH, 7.70; glucose, 11 mg/dL; protein, 4.5 g/L; LDH, 1458 units/L; WBC, 1340 cells/?L (64% lymphocytes); RBC, 4000 cells/?L; adenosine deaminase (ADA), 57.5 units/L. Additionally, serum protein was 5.6 g/L. Throughout his hospitalization, the patient had multiple AFB smears and cultures performed (2 concentrated sputum, 2 pleural fluid, 1 bronchoalveolar lavage), which were negative. A pleural biopsy demonstrated 1+ AFB on smear and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. The patient was started on an anti-tuberculosis regimen (isoniazid (INH) 300 mg, ethambutol (EMB) 800 mg, rifampin (RIF) 450 mg and pyrazinamide (PZA) 1000 mg) because of his findings of a lymphocyte predominant exudative pleural effusion, AFB positive pleural biopsy with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and history of exposure to TB. Given the persistent pleural effusion, he was given four doses of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and dornase alfa (DNase) instilled via the chest tube over a period of 6 days resulting in improved drainage and clinical and radiologic improvement (Table 1 , Fig. 2B). Fibrinolytic therapy was terminated at the point of near complete resolution of the pleural effusion as evidenced by CXR. The chest tube was removed and the patient was discharged on hospital day 13. Two weeks after discharge, a follow-up CXR demonstrated a persistent small right-sided effusion, however; the patient was asymptomatic (Fig. 3 ). Ultimately, the pleural fluid and biopsy cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. ",0
227,S1752928X13000863,Sudden death due to massive hemoptysis secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis – A case report," 2 Case report A 55-year-old male was subjected for autopsy on 13-04-12 who was found dead in a pool of blood with disturbed furniture in his room. Dead body was moderately built and poorly nourished. Faint postmortem staining present over back and was fixed, Rigor mortis was appreciated all over. Dried blood stains present over and around mouth and nostrils. No demonstrable external/internal injuries were noted at autopsy. Pleurae on both sides were thickened and adherent to the chest wall at places. Pleural cavity contained 200 ml of straw colored fluid on left side. Multiple enlarged peri-hilar lymph nodes, greyish-white in color, varying in sizes from 2.2 × 1.8 × 1 cm to 1 × 0.6 × 0.4 cm were observed and upon sectioning showed caseating necrosis. Exploration of the tracheo- bronchial tree showed blood. Fig. 1 . Both lungs were greyish-white and consolidated all over with multiple specks (tubercles) on the surfaces. Lungs when sectioned showed caseating necrosis with cavitation Fig. 2 . Stomach contained 800 ml of dark brown colored altered blood, no unusual smell, mucosa was normal. Other organs were intact and pale. Histopathological examination confirmed the fibro-cavitatory tuberculosis, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary edema and emphysematous changes in both the lungs and caseating tuberculosis of hilar lymph nodes. Microscopic examination revealed that alveoli were markedly dilated and alveolar septal vessels were congested. Foci of pulmonary edema were seen. Large areas of caseation necrosis with epitheloid cell granulomas composed of epitheloid cells, lymphocytes and Langhan's giant cells were seen. Foci of organizing pneumonia with fibroblastic proliferation were seen. Alveolar destruction with replacement by mixed inflammatory cell, infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes and histiocytes were seen. Blood vessels showed fibro myxoid thickening of their walls. Lymph node architecture was completely destructed and replaced by vast areas of caseation necrosis with epitheloid cell granulomas. ",0

231,S221300711730299X,Case report: Unusual cause of difficulty in intubation and ventilation with asthmatic-like presentation of Endobronchial Tuberculosis," 2 Case report We present a 25 year old lady, recently diagnosed asthmatic who presented to Emergency Department (ED), with sudden onset of difficulty breathing associated with noisy breathing for 3 days and hoarseness of voice for 6 months. A year ago, she was treated as PTB and had completed treatment. Since then, she had multiple episodes of bronchospasm that required nebulization at a local clinic precipitating the diagnosis of bronchial asthma. On presentation, she was in respiratory distress with silent chest and marked use of accessory respiratory muscles. An arterial blood gas revealed a severe respiratory acidaemia. She received treatment including hydrocortisone, continuous nebulised beta-2 agonists, magnesium, antibiotics, and a salbutamol infusion. As her bronchospasm was not responding, ED team decided for intubation. Multiple attempts at intubation at ED before an alert to ICU was made, as although the larynx was visualized as Cormack-Lehane I, they were unable to advance the Endotracheal Tube (ETT) beyond more than 1 cm past the vocal cord. Finally, she was intubated with ETT size 6.0mm Internal Diameter where cuff was just after the vocal cord and anchored at 16 cm. We had difficulty ventilating her as her peak airway pressure's was persistently high with severe respiratory acidosis. With the abnormal laryngoscopy and life-threatening bronchospasm and alternative diagnoses were explored. She underwent flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscope (FNPLS) that revealed subglottic stenosis (Fig. 1 ). CT Thorax/Neck showed features of tracheobronchial stenosis with post primary PTB changes (Fig. 2 ). Patient was subsequently treated successfully with anti TB medication and underwent multiple sessions of tracheal dilatation (Fig. 3 a–c). ",0
239,S0967586803001449,C1–C2 tuberculosis: a case report," Case report This 56-year-old woman presented with dramatically progressive quadriparesis, with more pronounced weakness of the upper extremities, over 1 week period. There was bilateral cervical pain for 3 weeks. She denied bowel or bladder incontinence. Neurological exam showed quadriparesis, with motor strength of 3/5 on the right and 4/5 on the left. There was decreased sensation on the right. Also noted were Lhermitte’s sign and left temporal hemianopsia. The patient, 10 years ago had a previous right hemithyroidectomy for a multinodular goiter and presently has a recurrent large nodular anterior cervical mass. Computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed a mass lesion in sellar–suprasellar area with broad based dural attachment consistent with meningioma. The magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed that the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was compressed and compromised with cerebellar infarct and right pontomedullary edema. There was a C1–C2 soft tissue enhancing mass causing compression of the cervicomedullary junction (Fig. 1 ). Cervical CT showed erosion at dens and base of dens involving the left C2 vertebral body (Fig. 2 ). Involved bone appeared expanded and part of cortex breached. Increased atlantoaxial distance was noted with part of C2 vertebral displaced, compromising the cervical canal. Laboratory investigations including tumor markers, rheumatoid factors were non-contributory except for a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) level. In view of the medullary cervical cord compression, the patient underwent transoral decompression and posterior occipitocervical fusion. A prophylactic tracheostomy was done and a thyroidectomy had to be performed because of the size of the goiter. These were done all in one sitting. The patient was placed on lateral decubitus position and lateral tilting of table (20°) was done accordingly (Figs. 3 (A) and (B)). Initially, an anterior decompression procedure was done via a transoral pharyngeal vertical incision and submucosal dissection to expose the C1 anterior arch. C1 was partly eroded by the lesion at its inferior and superior aspects with note of egress of serous fluid. Specimen was obtained for culture sensitivity studies (later on revealing Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp.). Anterior arch of C1 was removed. A soft tissue mass that was fleshy and yellow infiltrating the ill-defined and eroded odontoid process and part of C2 vertebral body was exposed and removed. Remains of the transverse and alar ligaments were barely recognizable. Specimens were sent for histopathologic studies. At the end of excision, the anterior dural sac covered with the remains of the ligaments was seen to be with good pulsation. The muscular and mucosal layers were closed with interrupted inverted vicryl 3-0. A midline vertical incision was done at the occipitocervical area down to muscular layer. Subperiosteal dissection was done showing the occiput, C1–C4 laminae and lateral masses. Posterior arch of C1 was removed. Dura was noted to pulsate well after decompression. Fusion with Cervifix plate over the occipitocervical (C3) area was done. Intraoperative X-rays were taken to verify spine alignment (Figs. 4 (A) and (B)). Multilayered closure was done with a drain placed. Post-operatively, the patient was maintained on an Aspen cervical collar. Strict perioral hygiene/care was observed. Patient was placed on nasogastric tube feeding until 7 days post-op, after which she was progressed to feeding orally. Motor strength gradually improved to 4+/5 in all extremities. The patient was ambulatory with support 1 month postoperatively. Histopathological results showed caseous necrosis with giant cells and no evidence of malignancy. The thyroid mass was a benign multicolloid goiter. Sputum acid fast bacilli (AFB) was +1 on its second specimen. ",0
243,S1878875017307684,Spinal Intramedullary Tuberculosis with Concurrent Supra- and Infratentorial Intracranial Disease in a 9-Month-Old Boy: Case Report and Comprehensive Review of the Literature," Case Illustration A 9-month-old boy presented with subacute fever and back tenderness for 2 months He was brought to medical attention when the fever acutely worsened. At the age of 4 months, he had a bronchiolitis-like illness, was found to have left upper lobe opacity, and was treated for suspected bacterial pneumonia. Later he was diagnosed with reactive airway disease and started on albuterol and budesonide, accordingly. Later, parents noted regression of previously achieved developmental milestones, including rolling over and sitting. The patient was born in the United States, although his parents had emigrated from Pakistan 3 years earlier. Vital signs were normal on presentation. General examination was significant for opisthotonic posture, macrocephaly, a splayed, tense, bulging anterior fontanel, and nuchal rigidity; the right knee was held in flexed position, and there was limited ability to extend the knees and hips; spinal and paraspinal tenderness, as well as hepatosplenomegaly, also were noted. Neurologic examination revealed lower-extremity hypertonia and clonus, in conjunction with inability to elicit pinprick sensation below the level of the nipples. Laboratory abnormalities included a microcytic anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Repeat chest radiography revealed persistence of left upper lobe opacity. Computed tomography of the head was significant for ventriculomegaly consistent with hydrocephalus, as well as hyperdensity in the left cerebral peduncle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed ventriculomegaly with evidence of transependymal flow consistent with hydrocephalus, as well as multiple ring-enhancing lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cerebellum (Figures 1 and 2  ), consistent with intracranial tuberculomata. Biopsies of the left parietal lobe were obtained, revealing acutely inflamed brain tissue with focal necrosis, multinucleated giant cells, granulomata, and acid-fast positive organisms (Figure 3 ). Gomori silver, periodic acid-Schiff, and Gram stains were negative for organisms. Paraffin block was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation and molecular drug resistance testing. MRI of the spine revealed a well-circumscribed ring-enhancing lesion at the T9–T10 spinal levels with surrounding vasogenic edema consistent with SIMT (Figure 4 ). The patient previously had undergone placement of an external ventricular drain for his hydrocephalus. Given his fluctuating neurologic examination, the decision was made to intervene operatively. He underwent T8–T10 laminectomy, midline myelotomy in conjunction with neurophysiologic monitoring for motor function (signal from dorsal columns for somatosensory evoked potentials was too weak), intramedullary dissection of tuberculoma, and drainage of caseous-consistency exudate (no attempt was made to debride the granuloma), followed by duraplasty (Figure 5 ). The patient had intact motor function in his lower extremities postoperatively, unchanged from before the operation. The patient subsequently was admitted to the intensive care unit and continued on antitubercular therapy (ATT). The patient's external ventricular drain was removed, and a ventriculoatrial shunt was placed for hydrocephalus, rather than a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, given ongoing abdominal distention, frequent vomiting, and hepatosplenomegaly. At 7-month follow-up, he moved all extremities with good strength, but continued to have cortical visual impairment, dysconjugate eye movements, and required feeding via a gastrostomy tube. ",0
244,S1472979218300908,A genotypic and spatial epidemiologic analysis of Massachusetts' Mycobacterium tuberculosis cases from 2012 to 2015," 2 Methods  2.1 Data sources TB Case Data: We obtained de-identified TB case data from the MDPH surveillance and case management system—the Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network (MAVEN). TB case data included the following variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, ZIP code, country of birth, month and year of positive TB culture, status of homelessness, employment (employed, unemployed, health care worker), drug use (injection vs. non-injection drug use), alcohol use, site of disease (pulmonary, extra-pulmonary, both), TB smear positivity, TB culture positivity, evidence of cavitary disease, TB drug resistance, TB genotype, TB genotyping lineage, and TB outcome data (completed treatment, died, lost to follow up, still on therapy, moved out of state or country). The status of homelessness, employment, and substance use are defined as occurring anytime in the 12 months prior to diagnosis and this definition is universal to all reporting jurisdictions in the United States. Massachusetts Population Data: We obtained ZIP code-level population data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS 2010–2014), with 5-year population data, to calculate crude TB rates per 100,000 [7].   2.2 Molecular epidemiological data We used MDPH's existing TB surveillance database [MAVEN], which links de-identified patient demographic information with TB genotypes obtained from the CDC's TB Genotyping Information Management System (TB GIMS) database. The linkage was made using the case's RVCT# (Report of a Verified Case of Tuberculosis Number), which is assigned by the CDC for surveillance purposes and is used by for both the genotyping data and the surveillance data. We selected the MDPH TB dataset from the period 2012–2015 as these years contained nearly complete (94%) genotypic data on culture positive TB isolates. We analyzed TB genotyping from culture confirmed M. tuberculosis cases.   2.3 Genotype definition In the National Tuberculosis Genotyping Surveillance Network (NTGS), a genotype is defined as “a unique combination of spacer oligonucleotide typing results (spoligotype), and 24 locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat typing (MIRU–VNTR).” [8] According to the CDC “Two patients were considered to have matching genotypes if their isolates had indistinguishable spoligotype and 24 locus MIRU-VNTR pattern” [8].   2.4 TB cluster definition & geospatial mapping For the purposes of this investigation, two or more cases with identical genotypes of M. tuberculosis, which were isolated close in time (<=3 years) and geographic space (<=50?km [km]), were defined as TB clusters. The time variable used was the time of case report for all of the analysis. The cluster radius of 50?km was chosen as prior studies demonstrated that setting a radius of a maximum of 100?km produced the same clusters as did a 50?km radius, while setting a cluster radius to 20?km tended to split clusters [9,10]. The cases fitting the identical genotype and time criteria were checked for a geographical closeness of 50?km radius via a geographic information system (GIS) (ArcGIS v10.3; ESRI, Redlands, CA). Each TB case was de-identified, and the ZIP code was chosen as the unit of analysis. Resident ZIP codes at the time of the TB case report were used to identify the geolocation of each TB case. We calculated a GIS buffer-zone of 50?km from the geo-centroid of each ZIP code with a TB case. We created thematic maps of TB case rates per 100,000 and TB clusters, at the ZIP code level, in the GIS.   2.5 Statistical analysis We conducted a Student's t-test for the continuous age variable, and conducted chi square and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables to determine whether clusters were significantly different from each other from a sociodemographic perspective.

246,S2049080117303692,Ocular tuberculosis in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia – A case series," 2 Materials and methods This is a retrospective single-centre case series of ocular TB in HUSM from January 2011 until December 2016. HUSM is a tertiary referral centre and a teaching hospital in Kelantan, at the east coast region of Peninsular Malaysia. It has a total number of 774 beds with 72% bed occupancy rate and caters about 33,000 outpatients monthly. We reviewed the list of notified TB cases under respiratory-TB clinic follow-up during this 6 years period and patients diagnosed with ocular TB were included in the review. Demographic data of patient's age, gender and race was collected. We reviewed their medical records and documented all clinical data in a confidential manner. All patients underwent both ophthalmic and medical evaluation. Ophthalmic evaluation included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Goldman applanation tonometry, gonioscopy and slit-lamp examination for anterior segment and fundus. Anterior segment imaging, fundus photography, B-scan ultrasonography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula and computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was done in selected cases. Patients presented with uveitis were investigated to exclude autoimmune diseases and other common infectious aetiology including sarcoidosis, toxoplasmosis and syphilis. They underwent a series of routine laboratory blood tests [peripheral blood count, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, liver enzymes, urea and creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, glucose, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic-acid (anti-dsDNA), complements (C3/C4) and toxoplasma serology] followed with sputum smear for detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB), chest X-ray and Mantoux test. They were screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done in a patient who had choroidal lesion and multiple cerebral abscess. Eye swab was taken in all patients who had eye discharge at presentation, and sent for culture and sensitivity test. Sample of pus and friable tissue from conjunctival abscess was also sent for culture. In patients with corneal ulcer, corneal scrapping specimen was sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect presence of mycobacterial DNA. Tissue biopsy from conjunctival lesion was sent for histopathological examination (HPE) and TB PCR analysis. Biopsy of intraocular tissue or fluid was not done. The diagnosis of presumed ocular TB made based on the ophthalmic findings and laboratory results. Once diagnosed by ophthalmologist, patients were referred to respiratory physician for further physical assesment. Any concurrent pulmonary or other extra-pulmonary TB manifestations were evaluated. Patients were then started on anti-TB therapy. Physician continued to follow up these patients for general body response and side effect of anti-TB drugs during intensive phase until completion of treatment. Ophthalmologist monitored the progress of the symptoms and managed the ocular complications accordingly. For all patients in this case series, treatment was started with broad spectrum topical antibiotic on the first visit to ophthalmology clinic. Corticosteroid therapy was administered after commencement of anti-TB therapy. The collected data were then analyzed. Data with numerical variables were described as the mean and standard deviation, while categorical data were expressed by frequency (n) and percentage (%). Ethical approval is not required by our institution for reporting individual cases or case series. The consent to write and publish this retrospective observational case series was obtained from the Director of HUSM on behalf of all patients. This review of case series was conducted in accordance to Declaration of Helsinki for human research, registered under Research Registry (Researchregistry2768). The patient's personal identification and clinical data were kept confidential, and data were reported as collective information. ",0
247,S2213007114000549,Co-infection of long-standing extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and non-tuberculosis mycobacteria: A case report," Case report A 69-years-old male patient was referred to physician with complains of cough for 3 months, tiredness and weight loss during September 2002 in north east of Iran. The patient indicated no history of fever at night and chills and also no family history of pulmonary tuberculosis. In examination no underlying disease and HIV was detected but he was heavy smoker. Three sputum samples were obtained over a 3-day period for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears and culture. The direct smears were positive for AFB, and his disease was diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis. He received standard anti-TB treatment recommended by WHO, consisting of rifampin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA) for two months, followed by four months of RIF and INH while his compliance was low. In March 2003, his weight increased and major health improvement was noticed. The smear was negative and consequently the treatment was stopped. In April 2003, because of symptoms recurrence, treatment was begun according to cat II as follow: two months treatment with RIF, INH, EMB, PZA and streptomycin (STR), followed by one month of RIF, INH, EMB and PZA, followed by five months RIF, INH and EMB. In January 2004 patient was admitted with hemoptysis. At this time direct smear was positive and therefore culture of sputum and drug sensitivity test was performed. The exams resulted in positive culture which was resistance against RIF, INH, EMB and STR. The patient was hospitalized for 124 days in the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD) (Tehran, Iran) and treatment was started with second-line anti-tubercular regimen consisting ciprofloxacin (Cip), amikacin (AMK), prothionamide (PTH), cycloserine (CYC), clarithromycin (CLR), amoxicillin-clavulanate and vitamin B6. The patient poorly followed his treatment for several years in spite of symptoms. In May 2008, because of no response to treatment, drug sensitivity test was performed for second-line anti-tubercular regimen using two critical proportions of 1% and 10%. The result (after 42 days incubation at 37 °C) showed resistance against Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, Cycloserine, Ofloxacin (OFX), Capreomycin (CAP), p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), ethionamide (ETH), Kanamycin (KAN). In August 2012, due to unusual persistence and resistance of infection, more investigation was recommended using biochemical molecular methods and therefore sputum culture and drug sensitivity test was performed in Regional Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory in Mashhad. It showed that direct smear and sputum culture was still positive for AFB. In September 2012, direct smear and culture was repeatedly positive and during this time due to digestive side effects, the patient refused to use regular drugs consumption. Mycobacterium isolated was niacin negative and had smooth colony and was resistance against RIF, INH, EMB and STR. PCR was performed on isolated mycobacterium that revealed NTM (unknown species). For more confirmation, another sputum sample was sent to NRITLD on January 2013. Using molecular methods particularly Spoligotyping, the isolated strain was identified as M. tuberculosis. In March 2013, chest radiography revealed a bilateral infiltration in upper lobes (Fig. 1 ). At that time his laboratory values were as follow: white blood cell (70.6% neutrophils) and red blood cell count were normal, Hemoglobin: 18.8 g/dL, Hematocrit: 58.5 mL/dL, urea: 47 mL/dL, Cr: 1.4 mL/dL, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 23 IU/L, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 19 IU/L. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, his weight was 55 kg. The patient still complained of cough and shortness of breath. ",0
249,S2213007116300454,Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to severe pulmonary tuberculosis treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A-48-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea. His sputa were strongly smear-positive and the mycobacteria obtained from culture were identified as Miliary tuberculosis. Routine blood tests showed white blood cell count of 12800/mm3, platelets of 35.0 × 104/mm3, C-reactive protein of 22.0 mg/dl, albumin level of 1.9 g/dl and a negative HIV ELISA test. His chest X-ray and computed tomography showed diffuse bilateral infiltration and cavity (Fig. 1 A, B), and blood gas test showed PaO2/FiO2 131.0. This patient was initially hospitalized in the ICU and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation started. Anti-tuberculosis drugs, including isoniazid, refampicin, streptomycin and pyrazinamide; antibiotics including meropenem and ciprofloxacin; and intravenous methylprednisolone (1.0 mg/kg/day) were introduced. Six days later, further deterioration of gas exchange prompted the decision to intubate and steroid pulse therapy consisting of intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day for 3 days) followed by intravenous methylprednisolone (1.0 mg/kg/day) was administered. However, on the 3rd day of intubation arterial blood gas analyses showed severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 60.4) refractory to conventional MV, and we decided to administer veno-venous ECMO. Ventilator settings were adjusted to provide lung rest (pressure controlled ventilation with peak pressure of 20 cmH2O, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and ventilation frequency of 8 per minute). Hemoptysis was observed on day 27 after the start of ECMO but ceased with adjustment to a lower dosage of heparin. No other ECMO-related major complications were evident during treatment. The pulmonary infiltrate and oxygenation status gradually improved (Fig. 1C, D, E, F), and the systemic corticosteroid was tapered. ECMO was discontinued on day 52 and we successfully weaned the patient from MV 106 days after the start of administration of ECMO. After a hospital stay and rehabilitation of 10 months, he was discharged from our hospital without severe disability. ",0
250,S2212553115000837,Osteoarticular tuberculosis dactylitis: Four cases," Case presentations  Case 1 A 64-year-old woman, diabetic and hypertensive, presented with pain and swelling of the fourth finger of the left hand that appeared after a benign trauma that occurred 21days before. There was no history of fever, weight loss or loss of appetite. The clinical study found a swelling and inflammatory aspect of the skin of the finger. The finger motion was painful and limited. Left hand radiograph showed an osteolytic lesion with blurred limits of the first and the second phalanxes of the fourth finger (Fig. 1a ). There was a cortical lysis without a periosteal reaction (Fig. 1b). Other lytic lesions were discovered at the level of the first and the second phalanxes of the fifth finger of the left hand. The interphalangeal joint did not present articular pinching. The analytical study showed elevated acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate: ESR=60) and a total leukocyte count at 8500/mm3. The intraoperative exploration of the fourth finger showed a friable bone with a grayish white necrosis material with soft consistency. Bacteriological study was negative. The histological study revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis. The special coloring of Ziehl–Neelsen did not highlight the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). This typical histological aspect made it possible to carry the diagnosis of a tubercular dactylitis. The investigations did not show other tubercular sites. The intradermal tuberculin reaction test was negative. Chemotherapy associating four anti-tubercular drugs was prescribed (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin) over 2months followed by bi-therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin) over 10months. This was associated with immobilization of the fourth finger by a splint for 21days. There was a remarkable response to therapy with the disappearance of inflammatory signs. Radiograph after 14months showed a significant reduction in the size of the lytic lesions with sclerosis around (Fig. 1c ).   Case 2 A 38-year-old woman, under corticotherapy, presented with a painful swelling of the fourth right finger for 2months. The clinical study showed a painful swelled finger at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint, without inflammatory signs or ulcerations. The mobility of the interphalangeal joint was painless. There was no history of fever. The right hand radiograph showed, at the level of the second phalanx of the fourth finger, multiple geodic, not-well-limited osteolytic lesions and a fracture of the phalanx without periosteal reaction. The interphalangeal joint did not present articular pinching (Fig. 2a ). The analytical study showed a normal rate of acute phase reactants (ESR=25) and a total leukocyte count of 8600/mm3. The intraoperative exploration showed friable bone with a geode that contained caseum. The bacteriological study was negative. The research of the MTB after culture on the Löwenstein–Jensen medium was negative. The histological study found a granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis confirming the diagnosis of tuberculous dactylitis. No other tubercular site was found. The intradermal tuberculin reaction test was positive. The patient received anti-tuberculous chemotherapy associating for 2months: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin, followed by bi-therapy (rifampicin, pyrazinamide) with a total duration of 16months. An immobilization of the fourth finger by a splint for 21days was initiated. The radiograph after 12months showed a reduction in the size of the lytic lesions with osseous thickening (Fig. 2b ). 4years later, an excellent osseous reconstruction was obtained with a good functional outcome (Figs. 2c–e  ).   Case 3 A 56-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presented with swelling of the fifth left finger evolving in an insidious way for 3months without any history of trauma or septic inoculation. The clinical study found a swollen finger without pain or inflammatory signs. Mobility of the interphalangeal joints was painless. The left hand radiograph showed an osteolytic lesion concerning the entire second phalanx of the fifth finger with cortical lysis (Fig. 3 ). The analytical study showed elevated acute phase reactants (ESR=70mm), leucopenia (3.900/mm3) and anemia (8g/dl). Intraoperative exploration of the fifth finger found a friable bone without caseum. The bacteriological study was negative. The research of the MTB after culture on Löwenstein–Jensen medium was negative. The histological study showed a granulomatous inflammation without caseous necrosis. The intradermal tuberculin reaction test was negative. CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was normal. The investigations have eliminated a breast cancer recurrence or metastasis. There was no context of tuberculous contagion. The Quantiferon TB test was strongly positive. The associated anti-tuberculous chemotherapy and immobilization treatment was initiated. There was a good response at 4months.   Case 4 A 43-year-old man presented with a painful tumefaction of the right thumb that evolved over 6months. The clinical study objectified a swelling of the right thumb with deformation of the nail without associated skin lesions or inflammatory signs (Fig. 4a ). The radiography revealed an osteolytic lesion on the second phalanx of the thumb (Fig. 4b ). There was no narrowing of the interphalangeal joint. The analytical study showed elevated acute phase reactants (ESR=80mm). Surgical exploration noted a grayish geode. The bacteriological analysis was negative. The histological study showed bone tissue colonized by a granulomatous inflammation centered by caseous necrosis, confirming the diagnosis of tubercular dactylitis. There was no history of tuberculous contagion. The intradermal tuberculin reaction test was positive. Investigations did not reveal other tubercular sites. The patient received anti-tubercular chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin for 2months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 10months. An immobilization of the thumb by a splint was initiated for 1month. The treatment provided full recovery with good functional outcome and complete resolution of clinical and radiological signs.

255,S1743919106002184,Anal tuberculosis: Report of a case and review of literature," Report of a case An 82-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented with constipation, anorectal pain and perianal ulcerated growth, faecal incontinence, rectal bleeding, weight loss, anorexia and an ulcer in the right groin for the past 3months. He was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 50years ago and was treated with anti-tuberculous medications (p-amino salicylic acid, streptomycin and isoniazid) and had left posterolateral thoracotomy and lobectomy. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy at that time and he was cleared of tuberculosis after the treatment. He was not on any immunosuppressive medications nor had any coexisting immunocompromising status. On examination, he was pale, slim, apyrexial and had generalized maculopapular erythematous rashes all over the trunk and back ( Fig. 1). There was an ulcerated, enlarged lymph node in the right groin measuring 2×3cm with undermined edges ( Fig. 2). Local examination of the perineum showed a wide posterior ulceration of the anorectum in the midline extending about 4cm into the anorectum and 4cm externally from the anal verge and it was about 3cm in breadth. A small opening of a sinus tract to the left of the midline about 5cm from the anal verge at the 3 o'clock position was also seen. There was also a large warty growth of 5×4cm in size, at the right perianal margin at the 11 o'clock position, extending to the right buttock ( Fig. 3). Thickening, hyperkeratosis, erythema and scarring of the surrounding skin were also noted. On digital rectal examination, the anal sphincter was lax. No rectal mass was palpable. Initial blood tests showed Hb of 9.3 and ESR of 40mm. Serum tumour markers were not elevated. Viral serology was negative including HIV. CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed left thoracoplasty, posterior midline anal fissure with marked thickening of the tract and lymph nodes in the right groin. Biopsies were taken from the groin ulcer and perineal lesion and surprisingly, showed severe tuberculoid granulomatous inflammation ( Fig. 4). Ziehl-Neelsen staining was positive for acid fast bacilli ( Fig. 5). Culture swabs from the groin and perineal ulcer confirmed mycobacterium tuberculosis. He was started on isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and pyridoxine. Gastroscopy was normal and barium enema showed only diverticular disease. The patient was followed up in the clinic 2 monthly and by the second visit the inguinal ulcer was almost completely healed ( Fig. 6) as well as the cutaneous lesions over the back ( Fig. 7). The perianal lesions showed marked improvement ( Fig. 8). He continued to improve and by 6months, all lesions were completely healed and he had put on some weight. Anti-tuberculous drugs were stopped after 6months. ",0
256,S2212553113000058,Tuberculosis of the middle ear and nasal passage: A case report," Observation A 55-year-old woman, without a past history of tuberculosis, complained one year ago from recurrent episodes of right purulent otitis media with hearing loss. Otherwise, she presented with a right nasal obstruction and purulent rhinorrhea. She was periodically treated with topical ear drops and per oral antibiotics. Purulent otorrhea and rhinorrhea stopped intermittently but started again. On physical examination, the right tympanic membrane presented with a central perforation and was slightly domed and partially covered with a layer of grayish secretion. The right nasal mucosa presented with purulent crusts and an ulcerative lesion of the middle turbinate (Fig. 1 ). An audiogram revealed conductive hearing impairment on the right side. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the temporal bone showed right mastoiditis with soft tissue in the middle ear, without evidence of bone erosion (Figs. 2  and 3 ). A biopsy of the middle ear’s granulation and middle turbinate’s ulceration was sent for histological examination which showed features of a granulomatous process typical of tuberculosis. To confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis, nasal crust and otorrhea were collected for polymerase chain reaction using IS6110 primer; a Lowenstein culture revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Three-drug intermittent anti-tuberculosis therapies with rifampicin (10mg/kg), isoniazid (3–5mg/kg) and pyrazinamide (20–25mg/kg) were administered for 9months. On follow-up examinations, the nasal cavity lesions were undetectable and the central perforation closed spontaneously with the curing of the otorrhea, and hearing loss progressed well; the patient remained without evidence of any recurrence at the one year of follow-up examination.

260,S1201971218344485,Recurrence of tuberculosis among patients following treatment completion in eight provinces of Vietnam: A nested case-control study," Materials and methods  Study population The initial cohort consisted of consecutively diagnosed patients aged 15 years and over with ABF-smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis, attending on of 70 National TB Program District TB Clinics in eight of Vietnam’s sixty-three Provinces between October 1 2010 and June 30, 2013. The cohort was comprised of participants in a cluster randomised controlled trial of contact investigation, that has been described (Fox et al., 2013). We performed a case-control study nested within this cohort. Standard first-line, or re-treatment, regimens were provided free of charge by the National TB Program, in accordance with local policies. Standard treatment in Vietnam does not consist of testing index disease for drug susceptibility. The standard first line regimen included a two-month intensive phase, during which patients received a daily injectable antibiotic (streptomycin), administered by health workers, together with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, followed by a six-month continuation phase comprising isoniazid and ethambutol. Treatment outcomes were recorded according to standard WHO definitions (World Health Organization, 2010). Cure was defined as a patient whose sputum smear or culture was positive at the beginning of treatment, but smear or culture negative in the last month of treatment, and on at least one previous occasion. Treatment completion was defined as the completion of treatment, without documentation of the smear of culture status in the last month. Treatment success was defined as either cure or completion of treatment (World Health Organization, 2010). Drugs were supplied to patients once or twice monthly by local healthcare workers through local clinics and self-administered daily by patients. Adherence was overseen by a nominated treatment supporter. In accordance with national policy at the time, ingestion of drugs was not directly observed. Follow-up for the parent cohort study was performed a minimum of 24 months after enrolment. Patients were re-traced by study staff and interviewed by telephone or during a household visit. Patients were asked whether they had been retreated for TB since completing their initial treatment. If patients had died or moved out of the province in which they had been registered, study staff interviewed the closest available adult household member to ascertain whether TB had occurred prior to censoring.  Cases The case definition was self-reported recurrence of TB. A participant in the parent cohort was considered a case if they responded that they were diagnosed with a second case of TB and if they were listed in the NTP file as a treatment success for their index disease (i.e. classified as cure or completed treatment).   Controls Controls were selected from the cohort by simple random sampling (World Health Organization, 2016). Controls were also required to be listed by NTP as having had successful treatment of the index case.   Information on risk factors Cases and controls both completed a detailed structured telephone interview with study staff. Self-reported education level, income, occupation, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, HIV status, self-reported MDR-TB, adverse events, adherence, and diabetes were all collected via interview. Additional details of initial diagnosis and treatment were extracted from the treatment registry. Demographic information including gender and age, as well as self-reported prior history of TB were extracted from a baseline questionnaire from the beginning of the parent cohort study.    Statistical analysis Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio for being a case conferred by various risk factors. First, unadjusted logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the individual effect each predictor had on the odds of recurrence. A stepwise approach was then applied to determine the independent risk factors. Factors that had a p-value of less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis were eligible to be in the adjusted model. Beginning with the covariate with the smallest p-value, factors were added sequentially to the model (i.e. forward selection). If the included factors were no longer significant with an alpha of 0.05, that covariate was removed from the model. An alpha of 0.05 was applied throughout to define statistical significance. Stratified analyses on factors determined to be potential strong confounders (gender, prior TB, and MDR-TB status) were also performed. Analyses were conducted using SAS v 9.4 (Cary, NC).   Sample size calculation We expected a recurrence rate of 6%, based upon notification data from the National TB Program (World Health Organization, 2015). We planned to perform the nested case-control study upon all individuals with recurrent disease who could be re-traced. As we expected to enroll 10,000 patients with TB in the main study (Fox et al., 2013), we estimated 600 control subjects were needed to allow a similar number of cases and controls.   Ethical issues Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Sydney and the Vietnam National Lung Hospital. Permission for data linkage and use of the programme registry was given by the Director of the National TB Programme. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in the randomised trial. Permission to conduct follow up interviews for the parent cohort was obtained from the National Tuberculosis program in accordance with local regulations at the time of the study in Vietnam.   Case definition sensitivity analyses Since the primary case definition utilized self-report, we performed probabilistic data linkage to the NTP data base using Linkplus 2.0 (World Health Organization, 2015) to identify recurrent TB. We applied pre-determined linkage rules, blinded to group allocation in the main randomized trial in order to assess whether an individual was a recurrent case (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US), 2007). Available variables for matching included given name, family name, middle names, gender, and year of birth. We allowed imperfect matching on middle names, and matches within one year of the birth year to account for differential reporting of birth date in the Vietnamese culture.  ",0
261,S0005273617301608,Lipids in infectious diseases – The case of AIDS and tuberculosis," 2 HIV  2.1 HIV infection process The HIV infection cycle can be described in seven steps (Fig. 1 ): 1) binding to the receptors on the target cell, 2) fusion of the membrane of the virus with the membrane of the cell followed by entry of the viral capsid into the target cell, 3) reverse transcription of HIV's RNA, 4) integration of HIV's DNA into the genome of the host cell, 5) translation of new HIV protein, 6) assembly of new viruses at the membrane, and 7) budding of viruses. Each of these steps of courses involve proteins that are the main targets of therapeutic drugs used in therapy (Fig. 1). Two pairs of events take place at the membrane interface (binding/fusion and assembly/budding). Many recent publications have shown that lipids play a key role in these steps, which opens the door to the development of new classes of drug to fight against the virus. Our goal is to give an overview of the most recent works highlighting the implication of lipids in HIV-1 infection and the tools that might be developed to block infection by altering lipid membrane properties.   2.2 The binding and entry of HIV viruses As shown in Fig. 1, the initial step of infection involves binding of the viral gp120 protein to the CD4 receptor, followed by binding to a co-receptor. The two main co-receptors involved in HIV infection are the G Protein-Coupled Receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. The co-receptor used for infection defines the tropism of the virus: R5 viruses use CCR5 and X4 viruses use CXCR4. R5 viruses are prevalent during the initial and chronic phase of the infection whereas the emergence of X4 viruses is associated with the progression toward a pathological state [1,2]. It is not yet understood how and why X4 viruses prevail during the final phase of the disease. The lateral organization of proteins at the surface of the target cell must be considered as an important factor that influences HIV infection. Indeed, membrane proteins are not randomly distributed at the surface of the cell. Their lateral organization and dynamics strongly depend on their lipid environment [3]. For instance, it has been shown that CD4 proteins — the mandatory receptor for HIV infection — are confined into domains [4]. Such a concentration of receptors facilitates the entry of viruses since effective infection requires the interaction of several receptors and co-receptors per virus [5–7]. Several lines of evidence have suggested the implication of lipid rafts in HIV infection [4,8,9]. The exact role of rafts has been debated for a long time, as contradictory evidence can be found in literature. Some studies have shown that localization of CD4 into raft domains is essential for HIV entry [4,10], while others have shown that efficient HIV infection can also use CD4 outside of raft domains [11–13]. These different studies have been done on different cell types (T-lymphocytes, HEK cells) that probably have different membrane organizations. This might explain these differences. An alternative view reconciling both sides of this debate has come from a recent study demonstrating that the virus-host membrane fusion occurs at the edges of cholesterol-rich domains [14], reconciling both point of views. The question of the localization into membrane domains also concerns HIV co-receptors and this might have an impact on the tropism of the virus that infect the cells. The infection can only occur when a virus interacts with several receptors and co-receptors [6,15]. Thus, the local density (i.e. lateral organization) of both CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 is certainly a determining factor [16] that can be influenced by the lipid environment. Many studies have shown that HIV receptors and co-receptors were confined into domains [5,12,17,18]. Such receptors clustering, which concentrate the proteins used by the viruses to infect cells, can be considered as entry doors. One can imagine that destabilizing these domains will significantly reduce the capacity of viruses to enter into the cells. In addition, if proteins are confined into separate domains, this can have an influence on the efficiency of infection, favoring one tropism over the other. For example, CD4-CCR5 interactions have been confirmed to occur into microdomains that were not rafts domains [5,11], while CXCR4 have been shown to be confined in rafts [19]. Such an organization could favor infection by R5 viruses at the expense of X4 [19,20]. A co-immunoprecipitation study has also observed a constitutive association between CD4 and CXCR4 [21]. However, this study has been performed in non-immune cells (HEK 293T) transiently expressing CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5. The question of the interaction of receptors and co-receptors into specific membrane domains has been studied by many laboratories on many different cell lines, leading to conflicting results. For example, some authors have shown that CD4 constitutively interacts with CXCR4 and not with CCR5 [21] while other authors demonstrated the opposite [22]. It has finally turned out that all three proteins can interact with each other, forming CD4/CCR5 and CD4/CXCR4 heteromers but also CD4/CCR5/CXCR4 heterooligomers [23]. Furthermore, CCR5 coexpression alters the conformation of CXCR4/CXCR4 and CD4/CXCR4 dimers, rendering the binding of gp120 viral protein inefficient and thus reducing X4 viruses infectivity [23]. As a consequence, the formation of these oligomers can be considered as targets to fight against HIV infection. Since more than a decade, it has been known that cholesterol plays a critical role in the entry of viruses [9,24–26]. Recently, some authors have proposed that the ability of HIV nonprogressors, who are able to control disease progression without receiving any therapy, is related to the low level of cholesterol in their antigen presenting cells [27,28]. There was a long debate whether HIV binds to receptors confined into raft domain or not [4,5,10–13,17,19,20], but finally, it appears that whatever the membrane environment (i.e. raft or non-raft domains) the key role played by cholesterol does not concern the binding but the fusion of the viral membrane with the one of the host cell. This fusion occurs thanks to the gp41 hydrophobic viral peptide that inserts into the host membrane (Fig. 1). This peptide presents a cholesterol binding domains (LWYIK) [29] allowing its anchoring into rafts [30]. In the presence of cholesterol, gp41 adopts a mostly ?-sheet structure allowing a deeper insertion in the host membrane [31], Fig. 1B. This insertion also induces a structural rearrangement of the lipids around the inclusion and softens the host cell membrane [32]. Furthermore, sphingolipids – the other major components of lipid rafts – together with cholesterol have been shown to promote gp41 aggregation in the viral membrane and to induce destabilization of the bilayer architecture at the locus of fusion [33,34]. Thus, targeting cholesterol-rich domains of the membrane allows the virus to facilitate the fusion process [35]. During fusion, lipids transiently adopt a non-lamellar organization that can be stabilized by cone-shaped or inverted cone-shaped lipids (depending on the leaflet they belong to). On the one hand, the HIV membrane is enriched in phosphoinositides [36] which, when situated on the inner monolayer, may provide the positive curvature required for fusion pore formation [37]. On the other hand, cholesterol present in the host membrane is known to stabilize the hemi-fusion pore [38]. As mentioned earlier, some authors have also shown that the fusion occurs at the edge of cholesterol-rich lipid domains [14]. Rafts are in a liquid-ordered phase (lo) while the rest of the membrane is in a liquid-disordered phase (ld). Thus, the interface between these two phases presents a hydrophobic mismatch resulting in a line tension which might be the driving force for HIV fusion [39].   2.3 The assembly and budding of HIV viruses Among the different proteins encoded by HIV-1 genome, Gag proteins are necessary and sufficient for the assembly and release of virus particles [40]. This assembly process has been extensively investigated within the last decade and lipids appear to play a crucial role in it. It has been shown that newly synthesized Gag proteins are primarily addressed to the plasma membrane as monomers or dimers. They multimerize at the plasma membrane to form nucleation sites composed of Gag-RNA complexes [41–45]. Three Gag subdomains are involved in the whole process: the matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC). MA contains a N-terminal myristoyl moiety and a highly basic region involved in the recruitment of Gag to the plasma membrane [46–48]. CA contains the amino-acids involved in GagGag interactions [49,50]. NC is zinc finger protein that binds RNA [51]. This assembly process is depicted in Fig. 1C. Viral lipidomics has revealed that HIV particles are enriched in several lipids compared to the plasma membrane composition of the infected cells from which they originate. Among these enriched lipids are cholesterol, sphingomyelin and more importantly acidic lipids such as phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and phophatidylserine (PS) [52–55]. Many studies have demonstrated that PI(4,5)P2 plays a key role in the specific binding of Gag to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane [56–60]. It has been shown that the Highly Basic Region (HBR) of the Gag protein binds to PI(4,5)P2 at the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This triggers a conformational change to an extended form leading to the exposure of its myristate moiety that inserts into the plasma membrane. This results in a reinforcement of membrane binding [57,61] that promotes GagGag multimerization [62]. Thus, modification of PI(4,5)P2 levels in target cells can decrease Gag binding to the plasma membrane or induce Gag accumulation in internal membranes and eventually impair virus release [60,63]. Cholesterol has also been proposed to play a role in the budding of new viruses [41]. Some authors have proposed that cholesterol facilitates myristate insertion thus increasing Gag affinity for the plasma membrane [64]. Consistent with this observation, Dick et al. using liposome floating assay have demonstrated that Gag can sense cholesterol and lipid order in model membranes [65]. Moreover, Gag has been shown to interact with detergent resistant microdomains [25,66–68], and the presence of microdomains enriched in acidic lipids -including PI(4,5)P2 - has already been observed [69–72], suggesting that the lateral organization of the plasma membrane is important for efficient virus exit of the cell. These microdomains might serve as platforms for Gag binding. Furthermore, it has also been shown that some proteins can recruit/sequester acidic lipids [73,74]. The question is now whether Gag binds to pre-existing domains or generates lipid clusters. Some recent results are in favor of the second hypothesis. HIV virions budded from different cell lines (i.e. T lymphocytes or macrophages) have very similar lipidic profiles, despite the different plasma membrane composition of these infected cells [36]. The authors propose that this observation is in favor of a selective lipid recruitment by the budding viruses rather than the use of pre-existing domains. In addition, a Coarse-Grained Simulations study has proposed that the MA domain of Gag proteins confines PI(4,5)P2 lipids due to electrostatic interactions [75] and hence generates domains [76,77]. A very recent study reinforces this hypothesis, showing, on models membranes, that Gag self-assembly is responsible for the formation of PIP2 lipid nanoclusters, enriched in cholesterol but not in sphingomyelin [78]. Nevertheless, these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. It is tempting to consider that Gag proteins first target pre-existing domains rich in acidic lipids, that are subsequently consolidated by the recruitment of new lipids.   2.4 Toward a lipid therapy? The Singer and Nicholson model of the structure of cell membranes has strongly evolved during the last 20years. The membrane is no longer considered as a simple lipid bilayer in which molecules are randomly distributed. On the contrary, cell membranes are composed of a huge variety of microdomains that contain different classes of lipids and proteins. The lipids constituting each domain can have different phase states and dynamics [79]. HIV viruses exploit this organization to facilitate its entry into the immune cells. Some microdomains act as entry doors, regrouping the molecules required for binding and fusion (i.e. receptors, co-receptors, cholesterol, sphingolipids). Since a long time it has been proposed that a molecule that can change membrane fluidity and organization would present a broad anti-viral activities against enveloped viruses [80–82]. In other words, the disruption of these microdomains or the modulation of their composition might impair virus entry. For this aim, different strategies have been used. A first strategy consists in modifying the target cell membrane fluidity. It has been shown that a 5% decrease of fluidity reduces HIV infectivity by 56% [83]. Glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice roots, lowers membrane fluidity and thus suppresses infection by HIV in Molt-4 cell lines [84]. This molecule has a structure similar to cholesterol. It inserts into the lipid bilayer of the cells and is predominantly located at the outer leaflet where it changes the mobility of the lipids [85]. A neutral glycolipid, the fattiviracin FV-8 isolated from Streptomycetes, presents similar properties [86]. The authors of these works propose that the increase of membrane fluidity blocks the fusion-pore formation. More recently, Matsuda et al. revealed that the Cepharantine, a natural product derived from Stephania cepharanta inhibited HIV infection via modification of cell membrane fluidity [87]. The same authors also observed that the trimeric coumarin GUT-70 affect membrane fluidity and inhibits HIV entry [88]. This molecule also down-regulates the expression of CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 and decreases viral replication by inhibiting NF-?B [89]. Another strategy aims to disturb the lateral organization of the target cell's membrane components. We have seen earlier that HIV-1 viruses make use of receptors and co-receptors clustering into microdomains. The interaction between the gp120 viral protein and the CD4 receptors is weak and lasts for only a fraction of a second [90,91]. This means that, once the virus has interacted with the CD4 protein, it has a very short time to engage in an interaction with its co-receptor (i.e. CCR5 or CXCR4). This is easily achieved when all partners are colocalized into the same microdomain. However, if the lateral distribution of CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 is randomized at the surface of the cell, the probability to engage in successive interactions with receptor and co-receptors will be considerably decreased, lowering the fusion efficiency. The same effect might also be obtained by modifying the formation of CD4,CCR5 and CXCR4 oligomers as discussed earlier [23]. By measuring the dynamics of CD4 receptors at the surface of living cells, it has been shown that the use of sphingomyelinase restricted the lateral diffusion of CD4 proteins and inhibited HIV-1 infection [92]. The authors of this study propose that the increase of the ceramide content of the membrane induced the clustering of CD4 receptors and prevented co-receptors engagement required to induce HIV fusion. The exogenous addition of long chain ceramides or the use of pharmacological compounds that increase ceramide levels in target cells also result in the inhibition, in vitro, of HIV infection without toxicity [93,94]. A similar mechanism of action is proposed to apply to cholesterol-specific antibodies [95]. The utilization of these antibodies remodels membrane organization of the target cell and prevents the proper spatio-temporal interaction of the gp120 envelope protein with its receptor and co-receptors. More recently, it has been demonstrated that thioredoxin inhibitors modulated extracellular redox conditions and modified CD4 membrane localization. This results in a strong decrease of HIV-1 infection [96]. A last strategy consists in specifically inhibiting the fusion between the viral and host cell's membranes. This can be achieved by the use of molecules that specifically interact with the gp41 viral protein and blocks it function (for review see [97]). The best known of these molecules is the T20 peptide (also called fuseon or enfuvirtide) which is currently the only viral fusion inhibitor used in therapy [98–100]. However, its application is limited due to low efficiency and apparition of resistances [101,102]. Fusion-inhibitor peptides suffer from several drawbacks: poor solubility, rapid protease degradation and emergence of resistant viral strains. Within the last years, lipids have been widely used to overcome these problems. As an example, the use of lipid raft-like liposomes has been shown to protect an antiviral peptide from degradation and to increase its stability. This allowed to specifically direct the inhibitor peptide to the membrane domains where the HIV-Env protein is located [103–105]. Another way to target the lipid raft fusion sites consists in covalently coupling active peptides to lipids. For instance, when the C34 inhibitor was derivatized with cholesterol, it showed a dramatically increased antiviral activity [106–109]. Glycosyl Phosphatidylinositol-Anchored C34 peptide also appears to be a good HIV entry inhibitor [110]. Other authors, based on the observation that the HIV lipidome is enriched in dihydrosphingosine [53], have linked this lipid to HIV-Env-derived peptides with no antiviral activities. These sphingopeptides were found to have an anti-HIV activity, suggesting that sphingopeptides interfere with the HIV membrane fusion site [111,112]. In 2015 a new peptide, named HP23, has been designed which targets the highly conserved pocket of gp41 [113]. Here again, an increase of the antiviral activity of this peptide has been observed when it was conjugated to fatty acids, cholesterol or sphingolipids. The strongest activity has been observed for the fatty acid-conjugated lipopeptide LP11 [114]. Blocking the exit/budding of HIV appears to be more challenging, even though Amphotericin B Methyl Ester (a cholesterol binding compound), has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 particle production [115]. There is still a debate on the putative role of pre-existing lipid microdomains on the binding of Gag proteins and the budding of new virions [58,76,116]. Furthermore, the main membrane actors of this process - PI(4,5)P2 lipids - are involved in many cell signaling events (for review see [117]) and strategies that would modify the balance or the organization of these lipids [60,63,118] might induce deleterious side effects. An alternative solution might be to modulate the membrane fluidity of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, since Gag binding is sensitive to membrane ordering [59,65]. This would present the advantage to block at the same time the entry step of viruses discussed earlier. Until now, no clinical trials using this class of molecules have been reported (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Therapies based on modifications of membrane phase properties are another promising strategy. For instance, the use of statins, which are used to treat hypercholesterolemia, has been reported to reduce infectious virion production [119–121]. Unfortunately, the precise mechanism of action of these therapies is still not clear and their efficiency has not been confirmed in pilot studies [122–125]. However, this is an active field of research, since 53 clinical trials have been performed in the last years and six new trials are recruiting at the time of writing (source: www.clinicaltrials.org). In conclusion, a better understanding of the mechanisms of entry and exit of HIV-1 will suggest strategies for the development of new classes of molecules.  ",0
262,S2212553112000350,Intestinal obstruction secondary to primary ileocecal tuberculosis: A case report," Case presentation A 22-year-old Iraqi male presented with a 7-day history of generalized abdominal pain, which was colicky in nature, associated with nausea, vomiting and absolute constipation. The pain was exacerbated in the last 2days before admission, which was associated with mild fever. The patient gave a history of abdominal colic occurring over a 12- to 42-month period. The pain would be present for several weeks at a time, but there would be intervals of up to a few months without symptoms. He stated that weight loss had occurred markedly. A physical examination showed a temperature of 37.9°C, a pulse rate of 110 beats/min, a respiration rate of 27 breaths/min and a blood pressure of 95/60mmHg. The patient’s abdomen revealed abdominal distension and generalized tenderness, but the tenderness was more localized on the right iliac fossa with decreased bowel sounds. Laboratory test findings showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.1g/dl, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 45mm/hour, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 64U/L and WBC of 12×106. Liver and kidney function tests were normal. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed a thickened bowel in the region of the terminal ileum and cecum with minor fluid collection at the right iliac fossa. Chest X-ray was normal. A plain X-ray of the abdomen in erect position revealed multiple air fluid levels suggestive of small bowel obstruction (Fig. 1 ). Because of continuing pain with generalized abdominal tenderness, particularly at the right iliac fossa and other features suggestive of acute intestinal obstruction, an urgent laparotomy was performed. An inflammatory mass with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mesentery of the mesoappendix was involving the cecal wall obstructing the lumen of the appendix. The mass was measured at about 5×5cm, and it was thought to be a Crohn’s mass or a tumor. It was mobilized and a standard right hemicolectomy was performed as shown in Fig. 2 . This figure shows a specimen of the right hemicolectomy with a mass in the cecum. On opening the cecum, the mass was causing erosion and necrosis of the cecal wall with subsequent obstruction of the ileocecal junction leading to small bowel obstruction. The ileum and ascending colon were normal. Histopathologic evaluation of the specimen showed multiple granuloma in all levels of the bowel wall and in the mesenteric glands. In some areas they coalesced to give caseation, and acid fast bacilli (AFB) were not seen on Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining in lymph nodes and bowel wall. Thereafter, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was reported to be positive from biopsy tissue. From the clinical, laboratory, radiological and histopathological findings, he was diagnosed as having primary intestinal TB. The patient was treated with a quadruple therapy for 2months, followed by Isoniazid (INH) and Rifampicin (RMP) combination therapy for a further 4months. Following the treatment, the systemic symptoms disappeared and the ESR and CRP returned to normal, and the patient gained 10kg in weight. The follow-up period showed no recurrence of the disease.

271,S2210261212002180,Prosthetic joint infections due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A report of 5 cases," 2 Presentation of cases  2.1 Case 1 A 72-year-old diabetic immunocompetent woman was evaluated for a periprosthetic infection occurring 7 years after a total knee arthroprosthesis. She complained worsening local discomfort and aseptic loosing was initially diagnosed and treated with one stage replacement in another centre. The patient developed an early surgical site infection treated empirically with teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin. Debridement was also performed, but infection was not cured and the patients developed severe skin lesions and bone exposition, with radiological signs of osteomyelitis (Fig. 1 ). At time of our first assessment antibacterial treatment was withdrawn and 3 swabs of the skin lesion were performed without identification of bacteria. Two-stage exchange was performed. Because of major bone gap, an external fixation apparatus was also implanted. Six intraoperative cultures resulted negative for bacteria or fungi. Histological examination revealed granuloma with Langhans cells but negative Ziehl–Neelsen stain. One month later, cultures revealed M. tuberculosis with no antibiotic resistance. The chest X-ray was normal. Combination chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol was prescribed for 2 months. Isoniazid and rifampin were extended for other 10 months. At the end of treatment, infection was clinically resolved. Arthrodesis was performed with resolution of pain but poor functional result because of asymmetrical gait (Oxfort Knee Score: 24). 4  One year later, the patient had no clinical signs of infection but she was able to walk only on crutches.   2.2 Case 2 A 79-year-old immunocompetent woman was evaluated for infection of a hip prosthesis implanted after traumatic fracture in another centre. She developed an early infection, empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. A fistula developed one year later, with isolation of Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotic treatment with linezolid for 4 weeks was prescribed in the other centre with clinical improvement and resolution of the fistula. In spite of clinical improvement, the patient still had pain (Oxfort hip Score: 28). At the time of our first observation a labelled-leucocyte scintigraphy suggested the persistence of infection and ultrasound scan showed the presence of an abscess, subsequently drained (Fig. 2 ). A two-stage exchange was performed. Empirical treatment with teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin was prescribed. Cultures of surgical periprosthetic tissue specimens were negative. After 3 months, the spacer was removed and arthroprosthesis was reimplanted. Intra-operative cultures were repeated. Bacterial cultures were still negative, but one month later M. tuberculosis grew, and combination chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol was prescribed. No resistance to antitubercular drugs was documented. The chest X-ray was normal. Treatment was complicated by gastrointestinal discomfort and the patient, in spite of medical prescription of antimycobacterial drugs for at least 9 months, stopped the therapy after 5 months. In spite of this short course of treatment, the functional result was good (Oxfort hip Score: 40) after one year of follow up.   2.3 Case 3 A 92-year-old immunocompetent female was admitted at our hospital because of periprosthetic infection with a fistula. A total hip replacement was inserted 3 years before in another centre because of traumatic fracture treated in a first step with intramedullary nail (Fig. 3 ). The patient had good functional results for 2 years but then she was bedridden because of extreme pain. Taking into consideration the old age and the high anaesthesiology risk (ASA 4), one-stage replacement was performed. The intra-operative culture yielded oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and antibacterial treatment with vancomycin followed by linezolid was initially administered. However, histology revealed granuloma with Langhans cells and, after 40 days, M. tuberculosis was identified. The chest X-ray was normal. Combination chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol was prescribed. There were several interruptions in antimycobacterial treatment for nausea (rifampin was changed with levofloxacin after one month, but also this drug was discontinued). Treatment was completely stopped after 9 months. Follow up at 6 months after the end of treatment was negative for reactivation of infection. The patient was able to ambulate with a walking frame with no pain.   2.4 Case 4 An 80-year-old immunocompetent woman underwent a total knee arthroprosthesis in another centre for arthritic pain worsened after fall to the ground. In spite of the surgery, she still complained pain, particularly during walking. At time of our first observation a labelled-leucocyte scintigraphy was positive for prosthesis infection. The device was removed with a two-stage exchange. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin was also administered but the patient developed acute renal failure. Cultures of periprosthetic tissue specimens were negative, but histological examination showed granuloma with positive Ziehl–Neelsen stain (Fig. 4 ). M. tuberculosis grew from the culture and, therefore, the anti infective treatment was modified. Rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol were prescribed for 2 months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid for one year. Two months later there was a dehiscence of the surgical wound with discharge from sinus tract. Debridement with retention of spacer was performed with success. The patient was lost to follow up 6 months later because of an ischaemic heart attack that requires admission to cardiology. Few months later she died, but until then, no clinical signs of tuberculosis reactivation were evident.   2.5 Case 5 A 68-year-old immunocompetent man underwent a radio-carpic arthroprosthesis on the left hand in another centre (Fig. 5 ). Two years later he developed an abscess with a deep fistula unsuccessfully treated with ciprofloxacin in the absence of isolated pathogens. He had aortic valve stenosis that needed surgical repair, but the absence of infection was required before cardiac surgery. Debridement and removal of arthroprosthesis was performed in our hospital and antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and cefepime was started. Intraoperative cultures were negative for bacteria but histology showed granuloma with negative Ziehl–Neelsen stain. After 40 days M. tuberculosis was isolated. Antimycobacterial treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was prescribed for 2 months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid for one year.

283,S2049080115001065,A rare case of fibrostenotic endobronchial tuberculosis of trachea," 2 Case report A 20 year old Vietnamese female presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath, cough, hoarseness, and significant weight loss. She was recently diagnosed with active pulmonary TB four months ago, and was started on anti-TB therapy, including Rifampin, Pyridoxine, Pyrzinamide, Isonaizid and Ethumbutal. Despite being complaint with the therapy, she frequently presented to ED with dyspnea and was treated with bronchodilators and a short course of steroids for the presumptive diagnosis of reactive airway disease secondary to anxiety (“anxiety asthma”). On her current presentation, she was afebrile with stable blood pressure of 129/84 mmHg, pulse of 102 beats per min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per min with 96% saturation on room air. Her physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia. The lung examination revealed labored breathing with the use of accessory muscles, biphasic stridor, diminished breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezes in all lung fields. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable with normal white blood cell count. Chest X-ray showed focal rounded airspace opacity in the left upper lobe consistent with the previous evaluations. CT-scan of neck revealed previous cavitating lesions in the left apex but no suspicious neck abnormality, mass, collection or adenopathy in the neck soft tissues (Fig. 1 ). Initially in the ED, she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and was placed on albuterol 10 mg/h continuous nebulizer treatments. She was admitted for an upper airway obstruction secondary to laryngeal edema or vocal cord dysfunction. She was placed on bronchodilator nebulizing treatments as needed and humidified oxygen along with a dose of racemic epinephrine with minimal improvement in her symptoms. Consequently, a direct laryngoscopy was done that was negative for any focal spasm, polyps, edema or vocal cord malfunction. A trial of lorazepam was given to rule out psychogenic stridor caused by emotional stress, that failed to relieve her symptoms. Bronchoscopy revealed 90% occlusion of the trachea with a small pin hole opening and tracheal web approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords (Fig. 3  ). CT-scan performed at the admission was re-evaluated, which showed the tracheal stenosis that was missed at the initial reading (Fig. 1). Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted at this point for balloon dilation. The biopsies of the tracheal web showed fibrosis but no granulomas or malignant tissue. Following the procedure, she was discharged home two days later in a stable condition with outpatient otorhinolaryngology and cardiothoracic surgery follow up appointments. Three months later, she presented to the emergency department with similar symptoms associated with fever and chills. Along with antibiotics, a repeat balloon dilation was performed for tracheal stenosis, and she was discharged upon resolution of her symptoms after two days. Three months after repeat tracheal balloon dilation, she was noticed to have labored breathing associated with chest tightness on her regular otorhinolaryngology follow up visit. The decision was made to perform suspension micro-laryngoscopy with CO2 laser incision of the tracheal stenosis. Also Mitomycin C, an anti-neoplastic agent, was applied to the area to prevent re-stenosis. She was discharged home in a stable condition after observation and did not have a recurrence of the symptoms again. The biopsy of the tracheal web revealed the same findings. The patient has not returned to the hospital for repeat dilations in twelve months. ",0

287,S2352621115000637,Scapular bone destruction: A case report of skeletal tuberculosis with a series of dynamic radiologic features," 2 Presentation of case A 38-year-old male patient had been well until approximately 2 months earlier, when fever and pain in the left shoulder developed. He also mentioned weight loss, fatigue and cough. There was a history of AIDS for several months and he was out of regular treatment. On examination, multiple discrete cervical lymph nodes were palpable at the right side with the largest being 2.5*2.5 cm, non-tender and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were also noticed. Laboratory studies showed a mild decrease in serum level of Ca2+ and marked an elevation in serum level of CA125 and ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cells (WBC), being 14.2*109/L, in which neutrophils counted 97.7% while lymphocytes 1.8%. CD4+ T lymphocytes counted 39 cells/?l. Mycobacterial lipoarabinomanan (LAM) detection test was positive. 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed not only focal FDG uptake in the regions of bilateral supraclavicular, axillary, hilar, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes but bony erosion and intense FDG activity in the left scapula with abnormally increased metabolism of adjacent soft tissue (Fig. 1 A). Malignant lymphoma was raised to suspicion. The bone marrow biopsy specimen and lymph node biopsy which were recommended for further evaluation, indicated anemia and AIDS-related lymphadenopathy respectfully and excluded the diagnosis of lymphoma (Fig. 1B). A thoracic CT scan showed: 1) a mixture of well and poorly defined nodules and ground glass opacities widely disseminated throughout the lungs with mediastinal and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy; 2) bone window showed lytic destruction of the left scapula with discontinuous cortex and bony fragment; 3) an adjacent soft-tissue swelling around the destroyed bone was also noted and no communication was remarked between the scapular lesion and lung parenchyma or pleural cavity (Fig. 1C). It suggests pulmonary infection and scapular osteomyelitis with sequestra and adjacent abscess formation. After a retrospective analysis of the radiologic studies and library tests, a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis with concomitant scapular infection was considered. Since the patient refused other biopsy, an empiric anti-tuberculous treatment underwent. The patient was at advanced stage of AIDS and considering his basic condition, the use of ART was set aside temporarily. At the follow-up after almost three months, the superficial lymph nodes were impalpable and a symptomatic improvement was achieved. The follow-up CT scan of chest demonstrated: 1) the pulmonary miliary foci of the initial CT scan decreased in number and size; 2) the absorption of scapular adjacent abscess was noticed; 3) bone window showed periosteal reaction along the scapular cortex, which confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis (Fig. 1E).

290,S2405579418300081,Molecular clustering of patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains cultured from the diabetic and non-diabetic newly diagnosed TB positive cases," Materials and methods  Study design A prospective cohort study was carried out in Kiambu and Nairobi counties of, Kenya between February 2014 and August 2015. Patients aged above 15 years who tested positive for M. tuberculosis complex on sputum smear microscopy were registered at the TB clinic once they were confirmed as smear positive. The diagnosis was based on the KNTP guideline criteria. The exclusion criteria included participants who were pregnant, within the gestational period, with chronic renal failure or on TB therapy. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Kenyatta National Hospital Ethical Research Committee (KNH/UoN-ERC) and the study was undertaken in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Written consent was obtained from patients who agreed to participate. Venous blood was collected at baseline in two separate tubes (one for fasting or random blood glucose levels and the other for HbA1c levels. This was followed by physical examination and questionnaire administration by trained healthcare personnel where detailed history, including signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and other life-style information were ascertained. Patients were then followed at two, three, five, six months and, at end of therapy to assess adherence and clinical evaluation with sputum microscopy examination at each time when possible. The initial sputum examination was submitted for culture and pathogen identification. Spoligotyping was then performed on all the positive cultures to characterize the strains. Patients were examined at each visit for both TB and DM. Loss to follow up were then compared between the TB-DM and TB without DM. MTB strains characterized and classified to their specific strains and MTB lineage compared with the demographic data from the questionnaire.   Laboratory analysis Laboratory sample processing was done at the National Reference Tuberculosis laboratory (NTRL) Kenya. Staining was done with ZN and FM, while sputa were decontaminated with Sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Ten microliters of the processed sputa was inoculated on 2 slopes of LJ and incubated at 37?°C for 8 weeks and read weekly. Positive LJ was confirmed by use of ZN, conventional biochemical tests to discriminate MTB complex mycobacteria other than Tuberculosis (MOTT).   DNA extraction and spoligotyping analyses Extraction of genomic DNA from TB positive culture slopes and spoligotyping were done at the South Africa Medical Research Council (SAMRC, Pretoria) as described by Kamerbeek et, al. [9]. Spoligotyping was performed using the spoligotype kit (Ocimum bio solutions company, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The direct repeats (DR) were amplified by ABI 9700 thermocycler using oligonucleotides primers (DRa: 5? GGT TTT GGG TCT GAC GAC 3? and DRb: 5? CCG AGA GGG GAC GGA AAC 3?) derived from the DR sequence. The DRa primer is biotinylated at the 5?-end. Biotinylation exploitss polymorphisms in the spacer sequences found in the direct repeats (DR) locus in the chromosomes of MTBC Strains. Currently the 94 different spacers sequences were identified of which 43 are used for MTBC strain differentiation which determine the absence or presence of the 43 defined spacer sequences.   Definition of terms A clustered case was defined as any TB case from the study populations whose strain type, based on the standard spoligotyping assay, was not indistinguishable from that of at least one other case, while a non-clustered cases shared a unique strain not found in the study population. Since the TB cases were from adjacent and proximate counties and all cases were notified within the same calendar year, the specific geographic and temporal timing of cases were not used in the definition of a cluster. This means that recent transmission was assumed to have occurred between TB cases who shared the same strain, either directly or indirectly via another identified or missed case, within the same population.   Data analysis We defined diabetes using a cut-off of the variable HB1AC such that a person is considered to be diabetic if HB1AC?>?6.5, else non-diabetic. TB treatment outcome was grouped into seven categories (C, D, F, NC, OOC, TC, and TO), diabetic conditions grouped into two groups (diabetic and non-diabetic), and two counties considered (Nairobi and Kiambu). Cross tabulation of TB lineage was done with Outcome, diabetic conditions, and counties to compare the proportion of each lineage across each of the categories of the other variables. The results presented in tables using frequencies with corresponding percentages within parenthesis. All genotyping data were entered into a Microsoft Excel sheet. Spoligotyping molecular analysis patterns was converted into binary and octal codes designations for easier analysis and interpretation [15]. This data was compared from previously identified strains in a data bank from the spolDB4 and for binary spoligotype was entered in the Share international types (SITVIT2 web) database from which contains more than 75,000 MTB isolates from different countries as opposed to orphans which designates patterns reported as a single isolates while the lineage of the Mycobacteria was obtained by SPOTCLUST online software (http://www.tbinsight.cs.rpi.edu). MLVA Compare V1.03 software (Genoscreen; Lille, France) was used to draw the minimum spanning trees (MSTs). The SIT or orphan spoligotype number appeared inside each node, and the distance (number of spacers of difference) between two nodes was shown on the edge linking these nodes. These phylogenetic trees were colored in function of various characteristics such as the MTBC lineages described in SITVIT and county of isolation. The MST is a graph which is undirected and connected. The MST links all isolates together with the fewest possible linkages between nearest neighbors. Furthermore, a spoligoforest was drawn as a “hierarchical layout” using the SpolTools software (available through http://www.emi.unsw.edu.au/spolTools. As opposed to the MST, the spoligoforest is a directed and not necessarily connected phylogenetic tree illustrating the parent to descendant relationships between spoligotype (considering the fact that spoligotype rather evolve by loss of spacers). TBVis tool (available at http://tbinsight.cs.rpi.edu/; [29, 30]) was used to visualize and map the spoligotype shared between different lineages and split by county of isolation.

295,S1110570413000982,Testicular tuberculosis in an HIV positive patient mimicking malignancy: A case report," Case report A 22-year-old male presented with a progressively increasing painless left testicular swelling of one year duration. There was no associated history of cough, fever or loss of appetite. He noticed weight loss but cannot quantify its extent. He went to a peripheral hospital where he was operated on, and same week, the swelling increased in size with associated pain in the contra lateral testis. The general examination was unremarkable. Upon genital examination, there was a left testicular mass measuring 8.00cm×6.00cm. There was a 1cm long healing scar at the root of the left scrotal wall. This was from the attempted solution to the mass by non qualified medical personnel. The right testis was also enlarged with a cystic mass and area of firm consistency and tenderness. Both epididymes were clinically normal. The PCV was 30% and ESR was 75mm in 1h. Patient was reactive for HIV, negative for Hepatitis C virus and had a positive serology test for Hepatitis B surface antigen. Urinalysis was normal. Fine needle aspiration cytology result was inconclusive. Scrotal ultrasound revealed an enlarged left testis measuring 6.34cm×3.89cm with no focal mass within it. The right testis measured 3.93cm×2.42cm with normal echo texture. Fluids with septations were seen in the scrotal mass, worse around the right testis. The epididymis appeared normal. An ultrasound diagnosis of enlarged left testis with bilateral hydrocoele was made. A clinical assessment of left testicular malignancy was made and he was scheduled for scrotal exploration and left transinguinal orchidectomy. Findings at operation included grossly enlarged left testis measuring 12cm in its largest diameter with its capsule adherent to the skin. Post-op surgical pathology revealed a caseating granulomatous lesion consistent with TB orchitis. The testicular parenchyma was completely replaced by caseating granulomas consisting of epithelioid histocytes, and Langhans multinucleated giant cells surrounded by plasma cells and lymphocytes (Fig. 1 ). The granulomatous infiltrate extended into the spermatic cord (Fig. 2 ). ",0
297,S2212553115001636,Selective immunoglobulin M deficiency in an adult with miliary tuberculosis: A clinically interesting coexistence. A case report and review of the literature," Discussion SIgM deficiency is a rare form of dysgammaglobulinemia which was described first in 2 children with fulminant meningococcal septicemia, more than 45years ago [1] and characterized by an isolated low level of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM). There have been a few cases reported in the literature, with a reported prevalence of 0.03–3% [2–4]. Adults with primary sIgM deficiency usually associated with autoimmune diseases and malignant neoplasm [3,4] whereas children may present with severe life-threatening infections, a few cases of possible primary sIgM deficiency in adults with no evidence of autoimmunity or malignant neoplasm have been reported [5]. Adult patients usually present with mild infections. Our patient, who was previously healthy with no evidence of autoimmunity or neoplasm, represents a possible case of primary sIgM deficiency in adults with severe life-threatening and unusual infections (Miliary tuberculosis). We reviewed and compared previously reported 43 patients with sIgMID from 1967 to 2015, including our patient, and their characteristics are summarized in Table 2 . IgM provides the initial response to foreign antigen and plays a regulatory role in the subsequent immune response development, accelerating the production of high-affinity IgG [6]. SIgM deficiency can be asymptomatic or may symptomatically present with infections from encapsulated bacteria and viruses, some of which can be serious and even life threatening infections varying from pneumonia to septicemia and meningitis. A few cases of sIgMD with mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection or M. tuberculosis, but none of them presented with MTB without T-cell disorders [7]. In primary sIgM deficiency, B cells, T cells and T cell subsets, and NK cells are normal [2,8]. T cell functions are normal [2]. Innate immune functions are normal [2]. Specific antibody response to pneumococci is impaired in 50% of symptomatic cases [2] as in our case. However, several patients with selective IgM deficiency and T cell and NK cell defects with MAC intracellulare infections have been reported [7]. In a subset of patients with sIgM deficiency circulating IgM+B cells are decreased or completely lacking. Specific IgG antibody responses against pneumococcus polysaccharides are impaired in a subset of patients with selective IgM deficiency who appear to respond to immunoglobulin therapy [6]. Furthermore, immunologic investigation neglected any possibility of an immune defect associated with tuberculosis, In our case the innate immunity is intact. T cells, T cell subsets, and T cell functions and phagocytic responses, serum IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgG subclasses were normal. The presence of the BCG scar as well as normal lymphocyte blastogenesis ruled out SCID. Several studies have previously reported and classified IgM deficiency in primary or secondary type. Our patient had no history of autoimmune disease or malignancy, as demonstrated in secondary IgM deficiency, so primary IgM deficiency was suggested. Is there any possibility of direct relationship between occurrence of secondary IgM deficiency and MTB? So, after 5months of treatment with negative results of sputum smears for AFB, we reinvestigated the serum level of IgM, which was low (22mg/dL) and serum IgG, IgA, and IgE were normal (1153, 233.2, 42mg/dL respectively) with a normal lymphocyte count. After an extensive literature review, we found relationship between lymphopenia and MTB. Lymphopenia improved after starting antituberculosis treatment [9]. However, they could not come up with a direct relationship between the cause of IgM deficiency and tuberculosis. Gerasimos, et al. reported an HIV-seronegative adult with disseminated TB having marked T-lymphocytopenia, which normalized after treatment with anti-tuberculosis therapy. Lymphocytopenia was attributed to disseminated TB [10]. There is no obvious explanation for the cause of T cell depletion. Probabilities include consumption at the site of infection, such as the lungs or suppression of T cell production by the MTB. Certain components of MTB such as d-arabino-d-galactan activate suppressor mechanism in vitro, which in turn might cause lymphocyte depletion [10] and IgM deficiency as a part of immune system suppression. It may be the observation of a phenomenon that need to be supported by conducting a cohort study of patients with MTB by analyzing lymphocyte subsets and IgM deficiency in a prospective manner. In contrast, the pathogenesis of primary sIgM deficiency is unknown with no specific genetic or molecular basis defined. A number of defects have been reported, including intrinsic B cell defects in plasma cell differentiation [8], increased T cell suppressor activity, which may be specific to IgM isotype or isotype-nonspecific [5]. There is no report of formation of anti-IgM antibodies (anti IgA occur in 20–40% of sIgA deficiency). Furthermore, transformation to panhypogammaglobulinemia or common variable immunodeficiency has not been reported for sIgMID, although subclass IgG deficiencies can occur [8]. This suggests that sIgM deficiency is a heterogeneous disorder, which requires further studies to elucidate the predominant mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. Although a role of antibodies in defense against MTB has not been described in detail, there is some evidence for the role of B cells and antibodies in host defense against intracellular pathogens including M. tuberculosis, as B cells can regulate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory responses and produce antibodies and cytokines which can modulate the maturation of antigen-presenting cells. Also B cells can regulate the differentiation of macrophages into subsets which are important in anti-mycobacterial defense. While role of antibodies are evident in the presence of monoclonal antibodies specific for a number of mycobacterial components including arabinomannan, lipoarabinomannan, heparin-binding hemagglutinin, and 16kD-crystalin, and passive transfer of serum with polyclonal antibodies against M. tuberculosis is protective in relapse of tuberculosis in SCID mice and the role is also supported by M. tuberculosis infections in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Ultimately, a role of antibodies in mycobacterial defense is supported by the presence of IgG antibodies against glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core antigen of MAC in 77% of patients with pulmonary MAC and none in pulmonary tuberculosis [11]. Therefore, an antibody defect in our patient may be responsible for the development of MTB. Further examination using lymphocytes of the patient with sIgMD will be necessary to establish the pathogenesis of this disease. ",0

302,S209007401500002X,A rare case of primary tuberculosis of the submandibular gland!!!," 2 Case report 36year old gentleman presented to our ENT clinic with a left submandibular region swelling, gradually increasing in size associated with occasional pain and low grade fever for 1month duration. He was treated by GPs as sialadenitis and received multiple courses of antibiotics with no improvement. There were no constitutional symptoms, night sweat and no TB contact. On examination a firm, mildly tender, defuse, bi-manually palpable swelling measuring 3×3cm in the left submandibular region was observed. The skin overlying the swelling was normal. The swelling was adherent to the mandible. There was no purulent discharge from the Wharton’s duct and its opening was normal. The rest of the oral cavity and oropharyngeal examination was unremarkable. There was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy and other ENT examinations were unremarkable. Other blood investigations were normal. He was immunocompetent. Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities. Contrasted CT scan (Fig. 1 ) of the neck revealed 3×4cm swelling within the left submandibular gland with inhomogeneous consistency suggestive of tumor. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the swelling revealed evidence of fibrosis and few neutrophilic and lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltration which was suggestive of chronic sialadenitis. Taking the above into consideration, patient who underwent uneventful left submandibular gland excision and specimen (Fig. 2 ) was sent for histopathological examination (HPE) which surprisingly revealed a granulomatous disease of the left submandibular gland (Fig. 3 ). TB culture was positive from the saliva. The patient was on anti-tubercular therapy for 6months. He completed the course successfully and uneventfully. In 1year follow up showed complete recovery with no evidence of remission. ",0
304,S0976566215001678,Tuberculosis of wrist joint in an 8-year-old child presenting as hamate osteitis: A rare case report," 2 Case report An 8-year-old male child presented to us with pain and swelling over right wrist for the past 6 months. The patient initially consulted a primary care physician but was not relieved of symptoms. The patient was malnourished and had an associated loss of weight and appetite. The wrist was in a position of 20 degrees volar flexion with only a jog of movements possible. Any attempted movement was painful. Mild swelling was noted in the carpal region dorsally, and the area was tender on deep palpation. Epitrochlear and axillary lymph nodes were enlarged. There was no history of trauma or contact with tuberculosis. He had no complaints of cough and sputum expectoration. Blood investigations were as follows: Hemoglobin – 9.2gm%, TLC – 11200mm?3, DLC P68 L29 E2 M1, ESR-31mm in the first hour by Westergrens method. X-ray of the affected wrist showed increased density of hamate with fuzziness of margins suggesting periosteal reaction due to osteitis (Fig. 1A and B). The rest of the carpal bones were apparently normal. Chest radiograph was also normal. Tissue culture for pyogenic organisms was negative. Biopsy reported epithelioid cells with necrotizing granulomas. PCR for Mycobacterium TB was positive. A diagnosis of TB of hamate bone affecting the wrist was made. The four-drug antitubercular treatment (ATT) was started (Isoniazid:H, Rifampicin:R, Pyrizinamide:Z, Ethambutol:E), with the doses adjusted to weight. A removable wrist splint was used to immobilize the wrist in 10 degrees dorsiflexion. His general conditions improved gradually. Sequential ESR showed gradual return to normal levels. Pain and swelling subsided by 3 weeks, and tenderness resolved completely in 6 weeks. Bracing was intermittent after 3 months. ATT as intensive phase (HRZE) was continued for 2 months followed by continuation phase of 4 months on Isoniazid and Rifampicin. At 6 months follow-up, the patient had no pain or deformity at wrist. He had some restriction of motion, with 40 degrees of palmar and dorsal flexion and 20 degrees of ulnar and radial deviations being possible. The lesions also healed radiologically without any sequelae (Fig. 2A and B). ",0
310,S2212553116301595,Passive case finding for tuberculosis is not enough," Active case finding versus passive case finding The principle objective of ACF is to find and treat cases of active TB that would otherwise not have been diagnosed at this time, using strategies that are in keeping with available resources. An important distinction between ACF and PCF is that the former is a screening intervention initiated by health services, as opposed to the latter, which is initiated by symptomatic individuals presenting to health-care. In general, ACF activities are additive to PCF. Consequently, the diagnostic algorithms and measures of success used in ACF may differ from those used for PCF. The population targeted for ACF is typically larger, and the prevalence of disease (or pretest probability) is lower. This results in a higher number needed to screen, to diagnose one TB patient, compared to the PCF context. ACF for TB generally begins with an initial screening step followed by confirmatory testing. Initial screening may comprise of one or a combination of symptom reporting or chest radiography, and if either are positive, a confirmatory microbiological test, such as smear microscopy, or a molecular test e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF [4]. Ideally, the confirmatory test should be rapid, hence Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture is a less feasible option, unless the health system in place has sufficient capacity to follow-up screened patients [4]. However, the use of symptoms or chest X-ray as the initial screening step has important limitations. Prevalence surveys have shown consistently that the majority of undiagnosed TB patients in the community lack typical symptoms of TB and a large proportion have no symptoms at all [10–12]. Furthermore, while chest radiography is more sensitive than using a symptom-based approach alone, this can be logistically difficult in many rural and remote settings. Xpert MTB/RIF used up-front as a primary screening tool (i.e., regardless of symptoms reported or chest X-ray findings), has been shown to be feasible and improve case detection in certain high risk populations, such as people living with HIV (PLHIV) [13,14], and also in ACF conducted in the general community [15]. While this approach may overcome some limitations of traditional TB screening, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this strategy in a programmatic setting is yet to be determined. One argument against ACF it that it merely detects disease earlier, but does not substantially alter individual patient outcomes. However, diagnosing and treating TB disease earlier is likely to have a substantial impact on TB transmission, decreasing the long term trajectory of TB in a population, and subsequently reducing the cost of TB control overall [16]. It is important however, when evaluating the population-level effects and the cost-effectiveness of ACF, to consider its impact over a longer time frame (e.g., a 20-year time horizon), as short-term assessments can dramatically underestimate longer- term gains of ACF [16]. Table 1  lists outcome measures that should be considered when evaluating the benefit of ACF, as well as the other key characteristics of ACF compared to PCF for TB. ",0
315,S001393511830522X,Household fuel use and pulmonary tuberculosis in western Nepal: A case-control study," 2 Materials and methods This was a case-control study of pulmonary TB disease in both men and women, recruited mainly from the Western Regional TB Center (WRTC) in Pokhara, Nepal. Although women are the adult family members generally most exposed to cooking smoke, men were also included as participants, as they are also exposed to smoke, particularly from heating and lighting fuels. Before any field work was carried out, ethical approval was obtained from the Center for Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Nepal Health Research Council. The work described was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects before they participated in the study.  2.1 Recruitment of cases Recruitment of pulmonary TB cases began in May 2013 and concluded in February 2017. Eligible for recruitment as cases were all patients, aged 18–70, with newly diagnosed active pulmonary TB by chest x-ray and sputum smear positivity (at least one of two sputum specimens positive for acid-fast bacilli by microscopy), using methods recommended by the World Health Organization (Getahun et al., 2007). Later in the study, cases diagnosed using GeneXpert (Cepheid Inc.) were included after the TB Center acquired a GeneXpert device. Excluded as cases were:  1. Anyone with known immunosuppressive conditions or taking immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy) to minimize effect modification, as exploration of this was not an objective of the investigation.   2. Anyone with a history of TB.    Although informed consent was obtained at the time of diagnosis, collection of data for the study did not begin until at least 4 weeks of treatment had occurred, as a precautionary measure for the field staff. Although the original intention had been to collect all cases mainly from Kaski District, where the WRTC is located, towards the end of the field data collection, since recruitment of cases from the WRTC was slower than anticipated, cases were also obtained from TB diagnostic centers in districts neighboring Kaski, namely Tanahun, Syanja and Parbat.   2.2 Control recruitment To achieve a suitable population-based control group for this study, we used the geographic distribution of residences of pulmonary TB cases mainly in Kaski District diagnosed by the WRTC in the previous 3 years. We sought to obtain a geographic distribution of controls (2:1, control to case ratio) that reflected the previous distribution of cases, on the assumption that the distribution of such cases during the period of study data collection would be similar. At the time of the study, rural areas of districts in Nepal were divided into political units called Village Development Committees (VDCs) and metropolitan areas were divided into wards. For example, the Kaski district comprised 47 VDCs and two metropolitan areas (Pokhara and Lekhnath). Each VDC had a population of around 3000–12,000. Pokhara city had a population of more than 200,000, divided among 18 wards; Lekhnath's population was about 70,000 in 15 wards. Based on statistical power calculations and on the expected gender ratio for cases, our goal was to obtain 1300 controls, proportionately selected on the previous distribution of cases from VDCs and metropolitan wards. Houses were randomly selected from the 2008 voter registration list provided by the Nepal Government Electoral Commission in Kathmandu, with each residence in a VDC or ward having a probability of being selected proportionate to the number of registered voters in the household. If more than one person in a household was eligible, a methodology was used that randomly selected from among those eligible, with a 2:1 ratio of males to females, reflecting the expected ratio among cases. We did not obtain historical data for the diagnostic centers in other districts, but for each case recruited from those centers, two controls were selected from the same VDC/ward using a similar procedure with the voter lists for those other districts—a procedure designed to be equivalent to the use of historical case data in Kaski District. For efficiency, rather than individually matching controls to cases as cases arose, the anticipated necessary number of controls was recruited on a frequency basis, ward by ward and VDC by VDC. Recruitment of controls was made by visits to selected residences in the VDCs. Residences in each ward/VDC were visited in the order of their random selection. If a house contained no person eligible to be a control or a selected potential control was unwilling to participate, then the next household was approached following the random order. Exclusion criteria for controls were the same as for cases— no TB history, nor on immunosuppressive medication. All participation refusals were recorded.   2.3 Data collection Apart from TB case diagnostic data, all study data for both cases and controls were collected during the field visit to the current residence.   2.4 The questionnaire The study questionnaire was developed in English and team-translated into Nepali for administration. It was set up on laptop computers using CasicBuilder Software (West Portal Software Corporation, San Francisco, CA). After extensive field testing to ensure cultural and linguistic appropriateness and correct functioning of skip patterns, data were directly entered on the laptop during the interview. Modules in the questionnaire covered means of cooking, heating and lighting in the household, personal history of tobacco use and alcohol consumption, socio-economic factors (education, income, type of work), housing type, health history, household history of TB, food availability, use of mosquito coils and incense, number of people in the household, presence of other household members who were smokers, number of rooms, kitchen configuration and ventilation features.   2.5 Diabetes screening test We obtained from both cases and controls a finger-prick blood sample, which we tested in the field for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) using the In2it (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, U.S.A), a point-of-care device operated on batteries. This test measures the presence of glycated hemoglobin, an adduct of hemoglobin and glucose, and provides a measure of the average level of blood glucose over about the last 4 months. Uncontrolled diabetics have higher levels of HbA1c than non-diabetics. Towards the end of the study, manufacture and sales of the In2it machines and their cartridges were discontinued by the manufacturer. We then switched to collecting a 0.5?ml blood sample from each participant using sterile venipuncture technique. This was put into a CBC vial containing the anti-coagulent EDTA. Blood samples were collected by trained phlebotomists, kept cool and taken to the Fishtail Laboratory and Diagnostic Center, Pokhara, where they were analyzed for their HbA1c concentration using a MISPA I2 automated analyzer (Agappe Diagnostics, Switzerland).   2.6 Conclusion of participation Each participant received 300 Nepali rupees (about US$3.00) as compensation for their time and effort. Participants were also advised of their HbA1c results and, if the reading was above 6.5%, advised to seek medical advice.   2.7 Data analysis The initial analysis involved a descriptive analysis, comparing distributions of key variables, mainly collected by questionnaire, but also from the HbA1c analysis, across cases and controls, with calculation of bivariate odds ratios and confidence intervals using conditional logistic regression, with the linking variable being the VDC or urban ward from which controls were selected. Conditional regression was used because of the large number of VDCs and wards on which cases and controls were frequency matched, causing small numbers of participants in many of the data cells (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). For selection of the main kitchen in households with two kitchens (none had more than two), we used the following procedure: (1) if one of the kitchens was used in more seasons than the other, then we selected that kitchen; (2) if seasonal use was equal, we selected the kitchen first in the following sequence: inside the main house, attached to the main house, separate building from the main house. This sequence reflects the descending frequency of main kitchens in single kitchen households. Most households contained more than one stove. Although one of these stoves was designated by the interviewee as the primary stove, we coded all secondary stoves with a series of dichotomous variables denoting presence or absence of each stove type in a household. For this purpose, any additional stove in a household that was the same type as the primary stove was not coded as present with the secondary stove variables. For diabetes, we coded as diabetic anyone who fell into either of two categories: those who reported a doctor's diagnosis of diabetes and those who had HbA1c levels of 7% or greater. The descriptive analysis by case and control status was followed by a descriptive analysis of how the same set of variables distributed according to the three primary fuel types used in study participant homes—LPG, biogas and wood. Multivariate analysis was carried out using conditional logistic regression, with the matching variable being VDC or urban ward. For the main model we included all likely household sources of household air pollution exposure, including cooking, heating and lighting fuels, mosquito coils and incense burning, as well as tobacco smoking. Potential confounders were selected by examining whether covariates were independently associated with the outcome and with cooking fuel use, the main exposure of interest, as well as individually testing whether each variable affected the main result of interest—for primary cookstoves. Variables that altered any of the main outcomes by 10% or more were included in the final model, after excluding possible colliders or variables on the causal pathway (e.g., kitchen ventilation and use of fume hoods). Most models were based on stratification by the effect modifier, sex, and some models investigated the influence of kitchen characteristics, and urban or rural residence. Meta-analysis of previous studies using a random-effects model was carried out to compare results of previous studies of pulmonary TB and cooking fuels that had excluded cases who had a history of TB with those that had not applied such an exclusion criterion. The basis for this was studies that had been used in two recently published (2014) meta-analyses and a few more recently published studies (Rabbani et al., 2017; Dhanaraj et al., 2015; Woldesemayat et al., 2014). Studies were excluded if they did not include a comparison of biomass with gas or where there was little variation in cooking fuel type across the study population.  ",0
316,S2213007116301964,Case report on pulmonary disease due to coinfection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium abscessus: Difficulty in diagnosis," 2 Discussion  M. abscessus, the most clinical significant rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) found abundantly in the environment worldwide, is more likely to cause pulmonary infection immunocompromised patients and people with underlying lung disease [1]. M. abscessus can also cause extrapulmonary infections; lymphadenitis, skin and soft tissue infection, musculoskeletal infection, prosthetic device infection, surgical site infection and catheter-related infections [2]. Pulmonary disease accounts for about 50% of cases [3]. A case was reported of M. abscessus lung disease in a patient whose lung disease progressed after lobectomy and medical treatment of PTB [4]. It becomes more clinically challenging to differentiate PTB from NTM pulmonary infection especially for patients with epidemiological predisposition [4]. In our case, we faced the challenges associated with the diagnosis of the coexistence of both infection in a patient with epidemiological predisposition to pulmonary tuberculosis. The clinical features of PTB and pulmonary infection due to NTM like M. abscessus are similar. However, it is pertinent to differentiate both disease entities because the treatments are different. Moreover, PTB is of public health importance. The radiographic findings can also be similar. In about 40% of cases of pulmonary infection due to NTM, the chest radiograph shows an interstitial pattern, mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates, and a reticulonodular pattern as well as multilobar involvement in about 50% of cases [2]. The most commonest radiologic feature of pulmonary infection due to M. abscessus is nodular bronchiectasis [5]. Based on the patient's country of origin, history of having been a prisoner of war, clinical presentation and the findings of investigations, he was started on therapy for presumed PTB which was continued despite a negative MTD. RIPE therapy was discontinued only when culture showed of M. abscessus. Although M. abscessus usually cause pulmonary disease in immunocompromised patients and patients with underlying lung disease, Varghese, and his colleagues reported pulmonary infection due to M. abscessus in immunocompetent patients without underlying lung disease [6]. The positive predictive value of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) like MDT in AFB positive specimen is 95% [7]. It is recommended that test for inhibitors (seen in 3–7% sputum specimen) should be performed and an additional specimen should be tested with NAAT if the first specimen from an AFB positive specimen is negative on MDT test [8]. Even if the second specimen is negative, the decision to treat for PTB should be based on clinical suspicion. Retrospectively, the RIPE therapy in this case should not have been discontinued considering the clinical and epidemiological circumstances. With treatment of both MTB and M. abscessus, sputum AFB became negative after one week of combined therapy and patient clinically improved.  M. abscessus, like other RGM, are susceptible to antibacterial agents but resistant to the antituberculosis agents. The M. abscessus in this case was susceptible to amikacin, cefoxitin and azithromycin and did not demonstrate the inducible macrolide resistance gene or erm gene. The patient was discharged home when his sputum AFB became negative and we are expecting a prolonged period of treatment. ",0
322,S120197120900201X,Changing trends in the clinical features of laryngeal tuberculosis: a report of 19 cases," 2 Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective study of 19 cases of laryngeal tuberculosis seen from August 1986 to February 2008. The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients before inclusion. These 19 cases were evaluated by an otolaryngologist and confirmed pathologically with a laryngeal biopsy in The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. From August 1986 to December 1990, five cases of laryngeal tuberculosis were diagnosed in our department. Another 14 cases of laryngeal tuberculosis occurred between February 1998 and February 2008. These patients received antibiotic treatment, atomization inhalation, and traditional Chinese medicine therapy at our clinic before admission. The evaluation of the patients consisted of a thorough history and videostroboscopy examination, chest radiograph, sputum culture, purified protein derivative (PPD) testing, biopsy, routine blood and urine tests, liver function tests, and HIV serum testing. We also evaluated the patients in terms of their age, chief complaint, lesion sites, stroboscopy findings, and status of the lung (including chest radiograph, sputum culture, and acid-fast bacillus stain). The results for the patients seen before 1990 and after 1998 were compared. Eighteen of the 19 patients received proper anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. The diagnostic procedure was a direct or suspension laryngoscopic examination with biopsies for histopathological diagnosis, with special staining and observation of tuberculosis granulomas, as described by Shin et al. 3   Eighteen of the patients were admitted to the Anti-tuberculous Hospital of Hangzhou. Patients were started on anti-tuberculous chemotherapy. The five cases of laryngeal tuberculosis from August 1986 to December 1990 were treated with the regimen of rifampin 600mg daily for 12 months, isoniazid 400mg daily for 12 months, ethambutol 1200mg daily for 12 months, and pyrazinamide 1500mg daily for 6 months. The 14 cases of laryngeal tuberculosis seen from February 1998 to February 2008 underwent standard anti-tuberculosis therapy (isoniazid+rifampin+ethambutol for 2–3 months, followed by isoniazid + rifampin for another 7 months).  2.1 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed with SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and presented as mean±standard deviation (SD). The independent sample t-test was used to determine p-values. The count data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.  ",0
323,S2214250916300269,Disseminated tuberculosis with prostatic abscesses in an immunocompromised patient—A case report and review of literature," Case report A 34-year-old Indonesian male presented with a four week history of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, odynophagia, dyspnea on exertion, and a 20-pound unintentional weight loss. The patient had a past medical history significant for intravenous drug abuse, alcohol abuse and 15 packs per year smoking history. The patient had moved to United States from Indonesia 7 years ago. Physical exam revealed a cachectic male with oropharyngeal candidiasis and crackles bilaterally. Diffuse abdominal tenderness on palpation was also noted. Laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood count (CBC), hyponatremia with sodium of 122 mEq/L, and abnormal liver function tests: AST 442U/L, ALT 150U/L, and ALP 295U/L. A fourth-generation HIV antigen/antibody test (Abbott Laboratories) was confirmed positive with a MultiSpot positive for HIV-1 antibodies. Hepatitis C antibody testing was also reactive. Additional testing revealed a CD4 count of 2 cells/mm3 and a HIV-1 titer of 427,000 copies/ml determined by a Quantitative HIV-1 RNA PCR assay (COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman Analyzer, v2.0, Roche Diagnostics). Chest imaging was concerning for either multifocal pneumonia and/or possible opportunistic infection (Fig. 1 A). Abdominal CT revealed necrotic mesenteric lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1B), micro-abscesses in the liver (Fig. 1C), and a 2.9×2.4×2.0cm fluid attenuation collection posterolateral to the prostate suggestive of an abscess (Fig. 1D-E). Urine analysis showed 2+ protein, 1+ urobilinogen, 3 red blood cells, and 2 white blood cells. Multiple routine urinary cultures showed no growth. Three sputum samples were collected and all showed 4+ acid-fast bacilli (AFB) (>36 AFB organisms per field of view at 400×magnification) by auramine-rhodamine stain and grew pure Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in less than 7days post-collection in the BACTEC ™ Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT). Following culture, drug sensitivity testing was performed, and the mTB isolate was susceptible to first line drugs, including isoniazid (MIC-0.2 mcg/mL), rifampin (MIC-1.0 mcg/mL), ethambutol (MIC-5.0 mcg/mL), pyrazinamide (MIC-100 mcg/mL) and streptomycin (MIC-2.0mcg/mL). The patient was started on rifampin–300mg twice daily, isoniazid–300mg daily, pyrazinamide–1500mg daily and ethambutol–1200mg daily (RIPE therapy). Antiretroviral therapy was not initiated at this time. Twelve days later, on follow-up imaging, the prostatic abscess remained unchanged and a CT guided approach was utilized to drain the abscess. Purulent fluid (2mL) was drained and sent for AFB culture. The purulent fluid revealed 4+ AFB by auramine-rhodamine stain (Fig. 2 A) and grew mTB complex. The direct Kinyoun stain is shown in Fig. 2B. Patient clinically improved on RIPE therapy and was discharged with isolation precautions. 3 weeks post discharge, antiretroviral therapy with dolutegravir and Truvada (HAART) was initiated. Post-discharge (28 days), the patient was brought to the emergency department with acute onset of drowsiness and incomprehensible speech. The patient had been compliant with his medications. At this point, differential diagnosis of Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and a new opportunistic infection including toxoplasmosis were considered. MRI of the brain revealed multiple ring enhancing lesions with surrounding edema in the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, the midbrain, and the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally as well (Fig. 3 A,B). The patient was started on steroids, empiric toxoplasmosis therapy with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. HAART and mTB therapy were continued. A lumbar puncture was performed that showed cerebrospinal fluid glucose of 54, protein of 116, RBC count of 7, and WBC count of 0. The cryptococcal antigen was non-reactive. Toxoplasmosis IgG was>5; however, Toxoplasma gondii PCR was negative. The patient’s hospital stay was also complicated by both hyponatremia and also hypertension attributed to SIADH. The patient gradually improved on the aforementioned therapeutic regimen and nearly two months later, brain MRI showed a decrease in the size of the lesions. The patient’s mental status also improved and the patient was deemed fit for discharge. The patient was lost to follow-up after relocating to another state. ",0
324,S1472979216303985,Successful management of acute interstitial nephritis in two cases of disseminated tuberculosis," 2 Discussion It is important to make a prompt diagnosis of AIN in order to prevent further kidney damage. Blood work including a CBC to assess for eosinophilia and anemia and a Chemistry panel may reveal a high BUN and serum creatinine, low or high serum potassium and/or hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Urine studies including urine sodium, urine creatinine and a urinalysis with pyuria, hematuria, eosinophiluria and proteinuria most commonly <1 gm/dl may occur, but nephrotic range proteinuria has been reported [1]. It is important to note than neither eosinophiluria or eosinophilia are sensitive or specific in the diagnosis of AIN. A FENA of >1% indicates renal or post renal acute kidney injury. Renal ultrasonography may reveal normal to enlarged kidneys and increased cortical echogenicity. The gold standard for diagnosis of AIN is a renal biopsy; this typically would demonstrate plasma cell and lymphocytic infiltrates in the peritubular areas of the interstitium, usually with interstitial edema. Once a diagnosis of AIN is established, the offending medications should be discontinued as soon as possible. In both of our cases, Rifampin was discontinued and in one of the cases pyrazinamide was also discontinued. Ethambutol and isoniazid have been implicated in the occurrence of AIN, but are probably less common as etiologic agents than rifampin [2] and pyrazinamide, and did not result in worsening kidney function in our patients. AIN may be induced more commonly by intermittent use of rifampin [3,4,5]. There is limited data to support the use of corticosteroids in the management of AIN although this is common in practice [6]. One of our patients was administered steroids, although this was in the setting of central nervous system tuberculosis for which corticosteroids were already indicated. Complications of AIN may occur due to the continuation of offending medications resulting in further nephrotoxicity, potentially leading to end stage renal disease necessitating dialysis [7] or renal transplant. The treatment of tuberculosis can be complicated in the setting of AIN. If rifamycins are not tolerated, the duration of treatment of tuberculosis is a minimum of 12 months, even for drug susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis and may be longer for disseminated tuberculosis [8]. Although rifabutin can be attempted as an alternative to rifampin, in order to try to shorten the duration of treatment of tuberculosis, this medication often results in a recurrence of the AIN, as was in the case of our two patients, and may need to be discontinued. In the absence of adequate treatment for tuberculosis, mortality may occur from overwhelming infection [7]. In the case of both our patients, an alternative regimen for the treatment of tuberculosis consisting of isoniazid, linezolid, moxifloxacin and ethambutol was started. Isoniazid, linezolid and moxifloxacin do not need to be adjusted for creatinine clearance. Levofloxacin was not used as the fluoroquinolone of choice due to a requirement for dose adjustment in the setting of a reduced creatinine clearance. Both patients required an unusually high dose of isoniazid at 600 mg daily in order to achieve a therapeutic level and although it is unclear why this may be the case, it might be because a rifamycin was not used in their regimen. It is also important to note that ethambutol does need to be adjusted for creatinine clearance. In conclusion, AIN can occur in the setting of and complicate the management of tuberculosis. It is recommended that Infectious Diseases and Nephrology be involved early in the care of these patients, preferably in an inpatient setting in order to expedite diagnosis and management. ",0
325,S1877056816301025,Two-stage operation to treat destructive midfoot tuberculosis: 14 cases experience," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 General information Between January 2008 to January 2011, 14 patients who were diagnosed with midfoot tuberculosis were enrolled in this study. Nine patients were male and five were females. The average age of was 29.7 (range, 20–41) years. This study was conducted with approval from the Ethics Committee of Jiaotong University. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. There were 8 patients of left side and 6 patients of right side. The patients suffered from 8months to 6years. All patients complained of pain and dysfunction in midfoot. There was sinus on the surface of skin in five patients. All patients denied there was tuberculosis in the remaining parts of body, such as lungs or stomach. All the patients accepted chest X-ray examination, there were the presence of lung tuberculosis in five patients. Old tuberculin tests (OT tests) were positive in 10 patients. Before the first stage surgery, biopsy had been performed in all cases. If the histologic appearance consisted of multifocal aggregates of epithelioid and foamy, infected macrophages, with scattered multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells flooding alveoli, with significant lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffing, the diagnosis of TB was definite. The results showed all cases were TB. The culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not performed routinely. All the patients had been diagnosed definitely relying on imaging examination and laboratory tests preoperatively. Plain film, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of foot and ankle were regularly taken preoperatively (Fig. 1 A and B). Eight patients were in stage IV and 6 patients were in stage III. ESR and CRP were both increased in all patients without HIV infection (Table 1 ). Because of pain, dysfunction of feet and destruction of Chopart joint, all patients were selected to surgical treatment.   2.2 Operative methods Two-stage operation was performed to all patients. At the first stage, medial incision, lateral incision and combined incision were used to expose Chopart joint and eliminate TB tissue. All the articular surface involved TB tissue should be completely removed until normal bone tissue were exposed. Infective and TB tissue were sent to pathological examination. Then, the defected bone tissue was filled with antibiotic bone cement. An amount of 1.0g vancomycin and 2million unit streptomycin were mixed to 40g cement. Normal longitudinal arch height should be restored and fixed by multiple K-wires in the cases of arch collapsing. At the same time, external fixator was used on the lateral side to maintain the length of foot (Fig. 1C and D). Surrounding skin and soft tissue of sinus should be completely removed at the same time. Cast was used while ankle was placed neutral position postoperatively. Anti-TB drugs, such as isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin were used orally per day postoperatively for 2months. Then, isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin were used per day for 10months. Intravenous antibiotics were also used for 2weeks postoperatively. Follow-up was performed per month including plain film examination and blood biochemical examination. When erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reaction protein (CRP) were both normal, the second-stage operation should be performed at least 6months after the first operation, as well as all the symptoms were under controlled. Original incisions were selected when second-stage operation was performed. Though bone cement was completely removed (Fig. 2 A), there was big bone cavity left. Autologous iliac graft was harvested and cut into suitable size to fill to the bone cavity. If iliac graft was insufficient, allogeneic bone graft was also used. After the arch and foot length were restored, K-wires were used to stabilize bone sites temporarily. If the alignment was satisfied according to fluoroscopic monitor, locking plates were used for rigid fixation (Fig. 2B and C).   2.3 Postoperative treatment Patients were encouraged to active and positive foot and ankle motion after 4weeks cast immobilization. Anti-TB drugs were used continuously for at least one year. Operative outcomes were assessed prior to surgery and again at every three months postoperatively with the use of clinical, laboratorial and radiographic outcome measures. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), SF-36 and VAS pain score were recorded at every follow-up. Complications including recurrence, infection and implant failure was also recorded.   2.4 Statistical methods Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 11 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Continuous data were expressed as mean values±standard deviation. Comparisons between different time points were made using paired Student's t-tests. A significant result was taken as P <0.05.  ",0
327,S1201971209001970,Perinatal malaria and tuberculosis co-infection: A case report," 2 Case report A 34-day-old, term, female infant, born to non-consanguineous parents was initially seen for a three-day history of cough and progressive lethargy, with poor breastfeeding and fever. The mother also noted that the baby had turned progressively paler over the last week. There was no history of abdominal distension, oliguria, alteration of consciousness, convulsions, or prolonged jaundice in the neonatal period. She was delivered at home by a traditional birth attendant, by spontaneous vaginal delivery, and there had been no immediate postnatal complications. She was not immunized at birth. The mother's past medical history was significant for an episode of fever due to falciparum malaria at eight months of gestation, which had been treated with chloroquine, but unfortunately not as per the recommendations of the National Malaria Eradication Programme, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Besides this, she denied any other illnesses during her gestation or in the immediate past. The father was an open case of sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) with a suggestive chest radiograph, diagnosed a month previously and was on intensive phase antitubercular chemotherapy (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) with partial response. At the time of the baby's admission, the father's sputum remained positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB; graded as 1+ (10–99 AFB per 100 fields examined) as per the guidelines of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) 1 ). On examination, the infant appeared pale, dehydrated, and tachypneic with labored breathing. She weighed 2.5kg and measured 53cm in length (both below the third percentile for age and sex). The rectal temperature was 39°C, and she had a heart rate of 194 per minute, a respiratory rate of 86 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 87% in room air. Moderate intercostal, suprasternal, and subcostal chest retractions were noted. The chest auscultation revealed bilateral, diffuse crepitations with occasional rales. The liver and the spleen were palpable 3.5cm and 3cm below the right and the left costal margins, respectively. Examination of the other major systems was non-contributory. A complete hemogram showed the following: hemoglobin 6.2g/dl, hematocrit 24%, total leukocyte count 19.7×109/l (neutrophils 67%, including band forms with toxic granulations, lymphocytes 32%), platelets 233×109/l. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 84mm (first hour) and C-reactive protein was 142mg/l (normal <6mg/l). She was started on antibacterial chemotherapy with intravenous ampicillin and netilmicin, pending blood cultures. A Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear showed trophozoites of Plasmodium falciparum, with parasitemia quantitatively reported as 20–50 parasites per 100 fields. The antigen test (optiMAL) for P. falciparum was positive, while that for P. vivax was negative. The peripheral blood smear of the mother at presentation failed to reveal malarial parasites and the antigen tests were negative. She and her husband both had negative ELISA for HIV-I and II. The blood urea nitrogen was 48mg/dl, creatinine 2.4mg/dl, total bilirubin 3.7mg/dl with direct reacting fraction of 1.2mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 172 IU/l, aspartate aminotransferase 124IU/l, and alkaline phosphatase 140U/l (normal <120IU/l). A chest radiograph obtained concurrently showed diffuse miliary mottling of bilateral lung fields (Figure 1 ). In view of her critical condition, as per the recommendations of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, 2  she was started on intravenous artesunate (loading dose of 2.4mg/kg, followed by 1.2mg/kg at 12 and 24hours, then 1.2mg/kg daily for 6 days), which was followed by oral mefloquine at 25mg/kg divided into two doses (15mg/kg and 10mg/kg at 6-hourly interval). Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. The suggestive chest radiograph prompted an additional search for pulmonary tuberculosis. The early morning gastric aspirates were graded as 2+ (1–10 AFB per field in at least 50 fields examined) as per the guidelines of the IUATLD 1  on days 1, 2, and 3. A lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed the following: normal opening pressure, glucose 24mg/dl, protein 78mg/dl, no AFB on smear stain. The blood BACTEC culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on the 18th day, while the same for CSF was negative. The mother did not consent to invasive diagnostic procedures for the exclusion of genitourinary tuberculosis; however her urine sample cultures for AFB on two occasions were negative. She was started on a four-drug regimen comprising isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin, at the recommended doses. The infant improved dramatically on combined antimalarial and antitubercular therapy. At 12 weeks of follow-up, she showed remarkable weight gain and was developing normally with age-appropriate anthropometry. At the time of writing, she was on chemotherapy with two drugs, isoniazid and rifampin. ",0

334,S0377123706801188,Mammary Tuberculosis - A Case Report," Case report A 32 year old married female, gravida 2 in 28 weeks of gestation, presented with progressively increasing, painful lump in left breast of one week duration and associated low grade evening fever. There was no history of any discharge from either nipple. On examination, she had a tender, firm, ill defined, lump in the left outer quadrant of breast measuring 7 × 5 cm. Overlying skin was erythematous and indurated but there was no evidence of fixity to the skin or the underlying tissues. The nipple and areola were normal. Opposite breast was normal. There was no axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy. The chest examination was normal. Examination of the abdomen revealed no evidence of any intra abdominal lump or ascites. Haemoglobin was 10 gm%, white blood count was 9,800 with polymorphs 54%, lymphocytes 42%, eosinophils 4%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm at end of one hour by Westergren method. Liver function tests were normal. Radiograph of chest was normal. Needle aspiration revealed purulent material. She was clinically diagnosed to be a case of acute breast abcess (right). Incision and drainage (I & D) was done. Peroperatively, there was a large pus filled cavity from which approximately 30 cc of pus was drained. Dependant drainage was established by corrugated rubber drain. Post operatively, she was put on inj cloxacillin 500 mg six hourly and inj gentamicin 60 mg eight hourly. Patient was discharged after five days once drainage stopped. She reported again in OPD within five days with recurrence of abcess. She was taken up for repeat I & D. Peroperatively another abcess cavity in close proximity to and in communication with original cavity was found. Pus was evacuated and dependant drainage re established. Patient was discharged on seventh post operative day. She presented for the third time with recurrence of abcess and persistent discharge from the site of previous incisions. I & D was done for third time and a biopsy was taken from the wall of the abcess cavity. Histopathological examination revealed tuberculous granulomas consisting of caseation, epitheloid cells and Langhan's giant cells hence confirming the diagnosis of tuberculosis of breast (Fig 1 ). Sputum for acid fast bacilli, done on three separate occasions, was negative. Repeat chest radiograph did not reveal any pulmonary foci of tuberculosis. Polymearse chain reaction (PCR) for mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive. The patient was put on ethambutol, INH, rifampicin and pyrazinamide (EHRZ) antitubercular therapy (ATT) regime. Presently she is on fortnightly followup. She has completed five months of the ATT course. The sinus tracts have healed and areas of induration resolved. However, a 3 × 2 cm area of residual, tender lumpiness persists in upper outer quadrant of the affected breast. Her pregnancy is progressing well without any complications ",0
338,S1201971215001976,Two cases of erythema induratum of Bazin – a rare cutaneous manifestation of tuberculosis," 2 Case presentation  2.1 Case #1 An Afghan male, age 45, was referred for dermatological evaluation due to round, tender, erythematous skin lesions on both lower extremities, sized 1-3cm in diameter. The patient had fled from Afghanistan over Pakistan to Denmark one year prior to initial evaluation. He was reported previously healthy and without any medication. The skin lesions had been present for some months. The patient reported no night sweats, no weight loss and no pulmonary symptoms. A punch skin biopsy was performed, and standard histology showed lobar panniculitis with focal non-caseous necrosis, vasculitis and granulomas (Figure 1A-D). No acid-fast bacilli were demonstrated. The patient was found to have a strong positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)-reaction (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold, Cellestis, Ltd., Carnegie, Australia) for M. tuberculosis infection. Chest x-ray was normal, and the patient's blood samples were without suspicious findings. The patient was tested negative for HIV and chronic viral hepatitis B and C. Due to the absence of pulmonary symptoms, the positive IGRA was interpreted as a manifestation of latent TB, and the patient underwent six months of mono-therapy with isoniazid and pyridoxine. The skin eruptions were still present at the end of treatment. The patient was re-evaluated one year after end of treatment. He had increasing dyspnoea, but no expectoration. He had persistent and new onset of skin eruptions, and a repeated skin biopsy showed lobar panniculitis. The IGRA was still positive, and the skin biopsy was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for M. tuberculosis-complex. A positron-emission-tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan revealed one FDG-positive lymph node in the right lung. Biopsy from this lymph node showed numerous lymphocytes, but no acid-fast bacilli or malignant cells. PCR was negative for M. tuberculosis-complex. Due to positive IGRA and the histological changes found in the punch skin biopsy, skin lesions were interpreted as erythema induratum of Bazin (EIB). The patient underwent 8 weeks of treatment with ethambutol, rifampicin, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide, followed by 16 weeks of rifampicin and moxifloxacin. The skin eruptions gradually shrunk, and had disappeared before end of treatment. Prior to initiation of treatment, the patient was evaluated for sarcoidosis and asthma by a consultant in pulmonary medicine, but neither was confirmed. The dyspnoea disappeared during treatment.   2.2 Case #2 A 67-year old woman from Romania was referred to dermatological evaluation for tender, round skin-eruptions, primary located on the trunk and lower extremities. The patient had been living in Denmark for the last 30 years, and had no known exposure to TB. The skin eruptions had been present on/off for the last 25 years, with spontaneous regression some months after presence. Punch skin biopsy revealed non-caseous necrotising panniculitis, with no demonstrated acid-fast bacilli. PCR-assay of the skin biopsy was negative for M. tuberculosis-complex. The patient had a strong positive IGRA-reaction. Other blood samples were within reference intervals, and a chest x-ray was normal. The patient was tested negative for HIV and chronic viral hepatitis B and C. The clinical and histologic picture was consistent with EIB. The patient underwent anti-tuberculous treatment, and the skin lesions shrunk in size. After six months of treatment, a few smaller and painless lesions were still present, and treatment was continued for another three months with acceptable response.  ",0
339,S0953620517302182,Nation-based case-control study investigating the relationship between oral corticosteroids use and pulmonary tuberculosis," 2 Methods  2.1 Data source and study design Taiwan is an independent country with >23 million persons. The Taiwan National Health Insurance Program launched in March 1995, and now it has covered around 99% of the persons living in Taiwan [9]. The details of the program have been written in previous studies [10–14]. A nation-based, retrospective, case–control study was conducted to analyze the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. The Research Ethics Committee of China Medical University and Hospital in Taiwan approved the study (CMUH-104-REC2-115).   2.2 Selection of cases and controls We selected subjects aged 20 to 84years with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th Revision, ICD-9 codes 010, 011, 012, and 018) between 2000 and 2013 as the cases with pulmonary tuberculosis. The index date was defined as the date of cases being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. We randomly selected subjects without pulmonary tuberculosis aged 20 to 84years from the same database as the controls. Both cases and controls were matched with sex, age (every 5-year interval), comorbidities, and the year of index date (Fig. 1 ).   2.3 Potential confounders Some medical conditions which could be related to pulmonary tuberculosis were included as follows: alcohol-related disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, gastrectomy, pneumoconiosis, as well as chronic liver disease including cirrhosis, hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection, and other chronic hepatitis. To increase the validity of analysis, subjects who had the same diagnosis for 3 consecutive clinical visits in the ambulatory care and/or one episode of hospitalization diagnosis could be included in the study. Principal diagnosis and secondary diagnosis were used equally. Therefore, pulmonary tuberculosis and other medical conditions were documented for 3 or more records in the ambulatory care and/or one record during hospitalization. All comorbidities were diagnosed according to ICD-9 codes. The accuracy of ICD-9 codes has been validated in previous studies [10–20].   2.4 Assessment of corticosteroids exposure It is relatively difficult to calculate the doses of topical corticosteroids use or inhaled corticosteroids use. It is also very rare for patients with long-term use of injected corticosteroids at outpatient department. In order to quantify the dosage, only oral corticosteroids were included for detailed analysis. Topical, inhaled, and injected corticosteroids were collected together as other forms of corticosteroids for adjustment. Oral corticosteroids in Taiwan were available as follows: cortisone, dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, and triamcinolone. To investigate the relationship between oral corticosteroids use and pulmonary tuberculosis, prescription history of oral corticosteroids before the index date was included. To diminish the biased results, subjects whose final prescriptions for oral corticosteroids were filled >12months before the index date were excluded from the study. Therefore, only subjects whose final prescriptions for oral corticosteroids were filled within 12months before the index date were included. Subjects who never had a prescription for oral corticosteroids were defined as never use. Those who ever had a prescription for oral corticosteroids were defined as ever use.   2.5 Statistical analysis Distributions of sex, age, oral corticosteroids use, other forms of corticosteroids use, and comorbidities between the cases and controls were compared by the Chi-square test for categorized variables, and the t-test for continuous variables. Initially, all variables were included in the univariable unconditional logistic regression model. Variables found to be statistically significant in the univariable model were further examined in the multivariable unconditional logistic regression model. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to investigate the correlation of oral corticosteroids use with pulmonary tuberculosis. We further conducted the analysis to investigate whether there were dose-dependent and duration-dependent effects of oral corticosteroids use on the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis. All data processing and statistical analyses were performed with the SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). A two-tailed P value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.  ",0
340,S1472979217302731,Should all suspected tuberculosis cases in high income countries be tested with GeneXpert?," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Diagnostic methods This cost-effectiveness analysis has a health care provider's perspective and starts after suspected TB patients have been referred to the relevant referral centers such as the hospital chest clinic. It is assumed that in the UK, patients do not access directly a hospital chest clinic without some intermediate referral. Therefore, the patients have already gone through a preliminary assessment by the general practitioners (GPs) or other primary health care gatekeepers. The GPs have treated the productive severe cough as a bacterial chest infection and prescribed beta-lactams/macrolide antibiotics first. The patients have not improved and hence they have been referred to a hospital chest clinic, which might include general clinics in low TB incidence areas and specialist TB clinics in high TB incidence areas such as London. In the chest clinic, the suspected TB patients have provided sputum specimens, which have been examined by smear microscopy and then cultured on bacteriological media. Whilst the bacterial culture is proceeding, decisions follow and our simulation starts after the above mentioned processes have taken place. Therefore, this analysis begins by assessing what will happen after the results of the sputum smear test are known if GeneXpert or another comparable system is present. The aim is to answer the following questions for countries with a low incidence of MDR-TB such as the UK:  a) “In what circumstances is it cost-effective to have a decentralised GeneXpert analyser in every hospital for TB diagnostics vs. a centralised one in referral laboratories ?”; and   b) “Should GeneXpert be limited to sputum smear positive cases only vs. testing any TB suspected case whatever the sputum smear status ?”.    We consider the following diagnostic strategies: (1) status quo ie universal microbiological culture and microbiological drug susceptibility testing (DST) only if M. tuberculosis is grown (comparator); (2) universal microbiological culture and DST plus concurrent centralised GeneXpert in a referral laboratory, applied to sputum smear positive cases only; (3) as above but with a decentralised GeneXpert analyser in every hospital; (4) universal microbiological culture and DST with concurrent centralised GeneXpert analysis in a referral laboratory, applied regardless of sputum smear status; and (5) as above but with a decentralised GeneXpert analyser in every hospital. The GeneXpert alternatives are carried out in association with microbiological culture and subsequent microbiological or whole genome sequence based DST. The objective of this analysis is not to consider substitution of culture and DST with GeneXpert but to measure the added value of speeding up informed decisions that will be finalized by a confirmed culture and DST, which is the current practice in the UK and most high-income countries. The rationale for considering the testing of sputum smear positive cases only was related to the potential budget constraints that might not permit universal testing. The rationale for considering a decentralised versus a centralised system is related to the potential advantage of gaining a minimum of one day in obtaining the diagnostic results (no need to transport the specimen to a referral laboratory) balanced with the extra costs of purchasing the equipment by hospitals in a decentralised system.   2.2 Data sources The parameters used for the cost-effectiveness analysis are in Table 1 . The average size of the high-risk group within TB populations accessing NHS hospitals is set at 6.8% and the MDR-TB prevalence in this high-risk group is set at 3.7%. This is based on the national TB statistics for England in 2014 [14] which reported that 6.8% of TB patients had been previously diagnosed with TB and the MDR-TB rate was 3.7%. The probability of TB among patients with positive and negative smears is in accordance with the culture TB confirmation rates among patients with positive and negative smears reported in England in 2014. The average MDR-TB prevalence rate in the low-risk group has been set at 0.6%, in accordance with the MDR prevalence found in TB patients that were born in the UK. Half of the pulmonary sputum smears are assumed to be positive in accordance with existing data reported in England in 2014 [14]. The other parameters, from Drobniewski et al. [15], include: the sensitivity and specificity for TB among positive and negative smears and the sensitivity and specificity for MDR diagnosis in confirmed pulmonary TB; the unit costs of the GeneXpert tests, the daily costs for standard and negative pressure isolation and first and second-line drugs in 2012, which were inflated to 2015 prices according to the hospital and community health services (HCHS) index [16]. Also the QALYs were estimated according to Drobniewski et al. [15]. The impact of TB morbidity was associated with daily utility decrements of 0.206 for each day spent as inpatient and 0.067 for each day as outpatient (Table 1). The utility decrements were multiplied by the number of days spent as inpatient and outpatient and then divided by 365 (days in a year) to estimate the QALYs lost while being treated as inpatient or outpatient. The impact of permanent hearing loss due to second-line drug treatment (aminoglycosides) for MDR-TB was estimated in accordance with Drobniewski et al. [15] as 0.008 QALY per day of treatment (Table 1), which were multiplied by the number of days a suspected case would have been treated during the 27 day period envisaged in the diagnostic pathways. We have assumed that in the UK (and in any high-income country based on accepted international diagnostic standards), the average time taken for microbiological culture and identification, and for the DST results are 14 and 28 days respectively, while the results of GeneXpert takes 2 and 3 days for decentralised and centralised GeneXpert respectively.   2.3 Cost-effectiveness The costs and benefits of GeneXpert accrue during the 27 days of the diagnostic pathways and cease on the 28th day whereupon the microbiologically-determined DST results finalise the treatment decision, with or without the presence of GeneXpert.  Fig. 1  shows how the parameters of Table 1 were used to generate the costs and the QALYs lost for a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients that were suspected to have pulmonary TB and undergoing testing with microbiological culture and DST only (comparator). Of these 100 hypothetical patients, 6.8 would be expected to have been previously diagnosed with TB (high-risk group) as per the 2014 TB national statistics for England. Half of the TB patients are expected to be smear positive and to be confirmed as drug-sensitive TB, MDR-TB, or non-TB, according to the 2014 national statistics for England reported in Table 1. The parameters of Table 1 drive the expected number of cases undergoing isolation and treatment while they are waiting for the results of the culture and the DST. The actions in Fig. 1 are in accordance with the presumed risk associated with belonging to a high-risk group for MDR-TB and for being smear positive or negative, in line with the TB control guidelines as summarized in Drobniewski et al. [15]. The above-mentioned actions determine the expected costs and QALYs lost described in the Annex. The rationale for isolation and treatment in the presence of sole culture and DST (Fig. 1) is modified by the concurrent use of the GeneXpert alternatives (Figs. A.1–A.4 in the Annex), which allows detection of TB and MDR-TB in 2 (decentralised) or 3 (centralised) days. Although GeneXpert can produce the results on the same day, we have taken a conservative approach and allowed for 1 and 2 extra days. The number of true and false TB and MDR-TB positive cases, which depends on the sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert for TB and MDR-TB and their prevalence drives the costs and QALYs lost. For example, the costs associated with the 46.6 low-risk SM+ in Fig. A.1 is obtained by multiplying the unit costs of the test by 46.6 and the unit cost of isolation and treatment by the number of days accruing between the 1st and the 27th day before the DST results are known. By the same token, the QALYs lost by the 46.6 patients are the results of the daily utility decrements associated with first-line treatment multiplied by the number of treatment days and divided by 365 (days in a year) in addition to the daily fractions of QALYs lost because of second-line treatment. The cost-effectiveness has been estimated by comparing the expected costs and QALYs lost across diagnostic alternatives. The status quo and the GeneXpert alternatives were ranked according to increasing costs to estimate their incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). If the ACER was > £20,000 (29,369 USD in 2015 value) per QALY saved, which is the maximum willingness to pay in the UK, the diagnostic strategy was considered not cost-effective. Then, the next higher cost alternative was compared with the least costly one, and so on until all the remaining alternatives were exhausted. Vice versa, any diagnostic strategy with ICER <=£20,000 was considered cost-effective.  ",0
342,S1297319X04000740,Tuberculosis of the greater trochanter: A report of three cases," 2 Case reports We report the cases of three Tunisians presenting trochanteric tuberculosis admitted to the clinic of rheumatology of the Charles Nicolle hospital of Tunis.  2.1 Case 1 A 30-year-old man is admitted to our clinic in February, 2000 because of an inflammatory pain on the lateral aspect of his right hip lasting for 4 months. This pain irradiates to the knee. Neither fever nor weight loss were reported. Examination revealed pain on palpation of his right trochanter without local inflammatory signs. Mobilization of the hips was normal and painless, whereas the left sacro-iliac joint was painful on palpation. There was a limitation of motions in the lumbar spine. Blood tests showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 27 mm, leukocytes 9500/mm3. The tuberculin skin test was positive 15 mm. Pelvic radiograph revealed left sacro-iliitis associated to a heterogen condensation of the right great trochanter without thickening of soft tissues in front. Computed tomographic scan confirmed the left sacro-iliitis without associated collection and revealed irregularities of the right great trochanter without abscess in soft tissues. Chest radiograph was normal. The bacteriological cultures for tubercle bacillus in sputum and urines were negatives. The typhic and brucellien serological diagnosis as well as blood cultures were negatives. CT Scan guided bone biopsy of the greater trochanter was performed. Histologic examination of the bone material revealed a granulomatous inflammation confirming the diagnosis of tuberculosis. So, tuberculosis of both right trochanter and left sacro-iliac joint was diagnosed. Anti-tuberculous treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide together with ethambutol was prescribed for 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 16 months. At final follow-up, 2 years after diagnosis, the outcome was favorable clinically with disappearance of pains and improvement of general state and radiologically with bone healing.   2.2 Case 2 An 85-year-old diabetic woman came to our clinic because of a cutaneous fistula of the lateral aspect of her right hip evolving for 1 year associated to a painful tumefaction of her right ankle without fever. Examination revealed two non-productive fistulas on the lateral aspect of her right hip. Tuberculin test was negative. Blood test revealed an ESR of 115 mm, leukocytes 5700/mm3, haemoglobin rate 12 g/dl. Right ankle radiographs showed erosions and narrowing of joint space. Pelvic radiograph showed an osteolytic lesion with multiple osteolytic foci in the right great trochanter and soft tissue swelling. Fistulography revealed evidence of a soft tissue collection around the right greater trochanter (Fig. 1 ). Chest radiograph was normal. The culture of synovial fluid taken from the right ankle was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. So, tuberculosis of both the right ankle and the great trochanter was diagnosed. Treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was started during first 2 months followed by both isoniazid and rifampicin for 12 months. Four years later, the outcome was favorable with disappearance of the ankle pain, healing of the fistula and improvement of the general state.   2.3 Case 3 A 28-year-old man was referred to our clinic in May, 1993 because of an inflammatory pain of the lower lumbar spine evolving for 9 months, irradiating to the left hip and to the lateral aspect of the right hip. A bad general state and pyrexia of 38° were associated. The patient had a clinical history of Pott’s disease of the lumbar spine treated on 1982 by abscess curettage together with anti-tuberculous treatment (isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide). However, this treatment was interrupted by the patient after 1 month only. Clinical examination revealed lumbar spine stiffness. The left hip was painful and limited in motion with a flessum of 15°. The lateral aspect of the right hip was painful on palpation and showed a productive fistula. Blood tests showed an ESR of 85 mm, leukocytes 9700/mm3, and haemoglobin rate 11 g/dl. Pelvic radiograph showed a coxitis of the left hip and a heterogenic osteolytic lesion of the right greater trochanter with soft tissue swelling. Lumbar spine radiographs revealed an L1–L2 spondylodiscitis without new bone formation. CT scan of the hips showed a destructive coxitis of the left hip and lesions of the right greater trochanter including cortical erosions and soft tissue collection. Tuberculin test was positive, but chest radiograph was normal. Cultures of sputum, urines and pus sample from the fistula were all negatives for M. tuberculosis. However, because of the history of under-treated tuberculosis, the insidious evolution of symptoms, the radiograph aspects and the positive tuberculin test, a multifocal tuberculosis of great trochanter, hip and lumbar spine was diagnosed. Anti-tuberculous treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was initiated for the first 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 14 months. Three years later, the outcome was good with healing of the cutaneous fistula, disappearance of pains, improvement of general state and normalization of the ESR.  ",0
347,S1607551X15002818,"Clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with breast tuberculosis: Analysis of 46 Cases"," Materials and methods  Patients The medical records of 46 breast TB patients who were treated between 2005 and 2015 at Yenimahalle/Ankara Tuberculosis Control Dispensary (TCD) were reviewed retrospectively. Approval of the ethics committee was obtained from the Ministry of Health. Informed consents of the patients were waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. Patients' demographic data such as age, gender, marital status, employment status, educational status, past and contact history of TB, comorbid diseases, the initial clinical findings, radiological investigations including breast ultrasonography (US) and mammography (MM) were recorded. All patients were also evaluated in terms of coexisting pulmonary TB, with chest X-ray and culture of respiratory secretion.   Diagnosis The breast TB diagnosis was mainly made based on histopathological findings from core needle biopsy, excisional biopsy of the abscess wall during drainage. Smear and culture of breast tissue or discharge were also other methods in the diagnostic workup. The histopathological findings of epithelioid cell granulomas, Langhans' giant cells, and lymphohistiocytic aggregates confirmed the diagnosis.   Treatment and follow-up All patients were treated with isoniazid (5 mg/kg day, max. 300 mg/day) and rifampicin [10 mg/kg day, maximum (max) 600 mg/day] for 6 months. In the first 2-month period, pyrazinamide (20–30 mg/kg day, max. 2 g/day) and streptomycin (15 mg/kg day, max. 1 g/day) or ethambutol (15–20 mg/kg day, max. 1.5 g/day) were administered. All patients were evaluated at the end of the therapy, and if there was no full resolution of symptoms and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was still present in any specimen, a treatment of 3 months was added. Patients were invited at regular intervals after the end of the treatment. All complications during the follow up period were recorded.   Statistical assessment The statistical package for social science (SPSS 21.0 IL, Chicago, USA) standard version was used for data analyses. Descriptive analysis was done for demographic, clinical, and radiographic features. The results are presented as mean ± SD/percentages for continuous variables and number/percentage for categorical variables. Chi-square (?2) test, Fisher's Exact test, and Mann–Whitney U-test were used to test for the significance of association between the two antiTB treatment groups (patients who healed with standard antiTB therapy for 6 months and those who needed extended therapy of 9–12 months). A significance level was accepted as p < 0.05.  ",0
350,S1930043318302772,Reactivation tuberculosis presenting with unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy," Discussion Unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy may have a wide range of benign or malignant etiologies. Peripheral lymphadenopathy is most commonly due to local or systemic benign, self-limiting disease such as infection, inflammation, trauma, or nonspecific reactive changes [1]. However, malignant causes must be also considered and excluded, although the prevalence of malignancy in the setting of isolated, unexplained lymphadenopathy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1% [2]. Axillary lymph node metastasis most commonly originates from primary breast carcinoma [3]. Lymphoma is another malignant etiology, but rarely presents as isolated axillary lymphadenopathy [4]. Extramammary malignancies that may present with axillary lymphadenopathy include thyroid, lung, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic cancers, although often not discovered [5]. With the presentation of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, a thorough diagnostic evaluation of the breasts is necessary, starting with a physical exam, mammography, and sonography. Biopsy is often pursued even in the absence an identified breast mass to exclude occult breast carcinoma or an extramammary primary cancer. Given the patient's symptom of axillary tenderness and the abrupt nature of its onset, it was initially presumed to be caused by the patient's rheumatoid arthritis. Enlarged lymph nodes associated with rheumatoid arthritis are mostly located in the axillary region [6]. Although rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy is not an uncommon manifestation [7]. Therefore, the patient's isolated, unilateral presentation of right axillary lymphadenopathy did not exclude a systemic autoimmune disease as the cause. The first biopsy's pathology result of granulomatous lymphadenitis has a differential diagnosis often categorized into infectious and noninfectious causes, with infectious causes further subdivided into suppurative and nonsuppurative disorders [8]. Noninfectious causes include sarcoidosis and sarcoid-like lymphadenitis as well as berylliosis. Suppurative infectious causes are Tularemia, Cat scratch disease, Yersinia, lymphogranuloma venereum, and fungal infections. Nonsuppurative infectious causes include tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Toxoplasma, lepra, syphilis, brucellosis, and a few fungal infections [8]. The patient's ultimate diagnosis from the second biopsy was reactivation tuberculosis. Tuberculous lymphadenitis may account for up to 40% of extrapulmonary tuberculosis [9]. The cervical lymph nodes are most frequently involved followed by the mediastinal lymph nodes. The axillary lymph nodes are least commonly involved with a frequency of 8%, contributing overall to only 3.2% of all cases of reactivation tuberculosis [10-12]. This case, therefore, represents a rare presentation of reactivation tuberculosis with unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. This case also highlights the importance of obtaining a complete history in patients with unilateral axillary adenopathy and facilitating coordination with different specialties when necessary, which may have prevented subjecting our patient to a second biopsy.

354,S1878124113000646,Tuberculosis of talus bone in middle aged man – A case report," Case report  History A 45year old man presented in the outpatient department with a gradually increasing swelling over the antero-medial aspect of right ankle joint. This had developed over the last 3months and gave the patient pain when walking. There was no history of any preceding trauma, pus discharge, constitutional symptom but for loss of appetite. On examination, the ankle was not warm, the swelling was fluctuant with slight localized tenderness on deep palpation. Dorsiflexion, planterflexion, inversion and eversion were restricted at their extremes ends and slightly painful.   Investigations Haemogram was in normal limits except for lymphocytosis (55%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was found to be elevated with a value of 80 by the Westergen method after one hour. A Mantoux test was negative. C Reactive Protein (CRP). was 47mg/L. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B surfaces Antigens (HBs Ag) were found negative. Chest X-ray was normal. The X-ray of the right ankle joint showed extensive lytic involvement of the talus with a small sequestrum, without any involvement of the distal tibia or fibula or calcaneum. CT scan and MRI scan confirmed the findings of the X-rays. Aspiration of the swelling yielded straw colored fluid. Ziehl–Neelsen (Z–N) staining of the fluid confirmed the presence of acid fast bacilli (AFB).   Treatment  Preoperative treatment – The patients affected foot was raised to 45° to reduce the swelling aided by the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. Along with this the patient was instructed to continue with active movements of the toes. Analgesics were given to decrease the quantum of pain. Surgery was performed when the pain and swelling subsided.  Surgical treatment – Sequestrectomy with curettage and subsequent bone grafting was performed as an alternative to talectomy.  Postoperative treatment and follow-up – A non weight bearing below knee cast was prescribed for 12weeks. Antitubercular treatment consisted of four drugs (Iso nicotinic hydrazide, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) for two months, followed by a 3 drug regime (Iso nicotinic hydrazide, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide) for 6months, and 2 drugs regimen (Iso nicotinic hydrazide, Rifampicin) for 12months was given. The patient was allowed to be partial weight bearing 3months after the operation. The lytic lesion had sclerosed on the X-ray of the affected part taken five months after the operation. At the end of 20months the patient had full and painless motion at the ankle and subtalar joint. There was no evidence of recurrence (Fig. 1 ).  ",0

Whole-spine MRI revealed multiple enhanced lesions in the whole spine with circumferential, paravertebral, and epidural abscesses; there was also a compression fracture and gibbus deformity at the second thoracic spine with thecal sac compression (Fig. 1 ). The patient underwent staged operations. First, she received anterior cervicothoracic decompression to release the pressure of the cold abscess, and a specimen of pus was sent for examination. Halo ring traction was applied to regain alignment and the maximal traction force was 17 kg. Then the halo vest was fixed, and she received posterior fixation from the C5 to T6 levels using lateral mass screws at the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, with transpedicle screws at the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae. Posterolateral fusion was performed with artificial and autogenous bone grafts. A laminoplasty from the first to the fifth thoracic vertebra was also performed for posterior decompression. The paravertebral abscess at the T9/T10 level was managed by drainage only. The pathologic examination revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis, and culture of the pus yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The anti-HIV antibody test was negative. Spinal computed tomography showed great reduction of the kyphotic angle, as measured by the Harrison posterior tangent method [5] from 61 degrees before halo ring traction to 36.5 degrees 28 months postoperatively (Fig. 2 ). Bony fusion also occurred (Fig. 3 ). The patient wore a halo vest for 3 months and a sternal-occipital-mandibular immobilizer for another 3 months. Shereceived anti-TB agents for 17 months and underwent rehabilitation. There was no fecal or urinary incontinence and her muscle power recovered gradually.

361,S2210600615000258,Study of drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis cases in south coastal Karnataka," 2 Methodology  2.1 Study settings The cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology of a tertiary care centre of south-west coastal Karnataka in liaison with the district tuberculosis office during the period of September 2011–August 2014. Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the institutional ethics committee.   2.2 Sample collection A total number of 990 cases of smear positive PTB patients with ages ?15years from Designated Microscopy Centres of the Udupi district (including centres of three talukas and district tuberculosis centre), Karnataka were included in the study. Out of the 990 cases, cultures of samples from 28 cases had been contaminated, data could not be collected completely for 33 cases who denied participation, 37 cases were lost to follow up either due to mortality or switching over to private treatment and about 30 samples were culture negative after eight weeks of incubation. Hence the data for the remaining 862 cases as per the sample size calculation are presented in the study. Two sputum samples-one spot and one early morning sample were initially collected from each patient and the follow-up sample was collected after 3months of the anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). The HIV status was determined for all the patients without failure under the revised national tuberculosis control programme with a spot test (Comb Aids, Span Diagnostics, India). The demographic data of all the cases were obtained by the interviewer through a pre-designed questionnaire. No other forms of tuberculosis were evaluated in the study.   2.3 Sample processing All the sputum samples were transported to our lab in the cold chain. Decontamination and concentration of the samples were done using the modified Petroff’s method [11]. Samples were cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen media, incubated for 4–8weeks and the growth was confirmed with the help of MPT 64 antigen detection kit as M. tuberculosis. (SD Bioline TB Ag MPT64, Standard Diagnostics, Inc., Korea).   2.4 Drug sensitivity testing First line drugs streptomycin (4?g), isoniazid (0.2?g), rifampicin (40?g), and ethambutol (2?g) and second line drugs capreomycin (40?g), kanamycin (30?g), amikacin (40?g), ofloxacin (2?g), and ethionamide (40?g and 57?g), were used for the 1% proportionate drug sensitivity testing as per the WHO guidelines 2008 [12].   2.5 Statistical evaluation All the cases were classified in two groups: MDR and non-MDR. The association of demographical and clinical parameters for these groups was analysed using logistic regression. The prevalence of MDR and outcomes of treatment are reported in percentages with 95% confidence interval. The treatment outcomes of MDR and non-MDR cases were compared using Fisher’s exact test. Risk was estimated using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).   2.6 Important definitions     Category 1: Newly diagnosed case of PTB with no history of previous treatment with ATT.    Category 2: Cases of PTB previously diagnosed and treated with ATT includes failure/relapse/defaulter.    Taluka: It is an area of land with a city or town that serves as its administrative centre, with possible additional towns, and usually a number of villages.    Grey collar worker: Refers to people with occupations like farming, other forms of agribusiness, fishing, security, catering and skilled and semi-skilled labour.

364,S0090301903002659,Sacral tuberculosis: a case report and review of the literature,"Spinal infection with TB may be associated with pulmonary infection, occurring in less than 1% of patients with TB or, more rarely, occurring in the absence of pulmonary infection [3,6,11,17]. The likely route is hematogenous via Batson’s plexus from an initial focus in the lungs [9,8,16]. Nearly half of patients with skeletal TB will have a negative chest X-ray [2,6]. The most common locations for spinal infection with TB, whether primary or secondary to pulmonary TB infection, are the lower thoracic and lumbar spinal locations [2]. Infection of the lumbosacral junction with TB, by contrast, is quite rare, occurring in only 2 to 3% of all cases of spinal TB [1,4,9,13,14]. Isolated sacral TB is rarer still, limited to one case report and sporadic references in larger case series of spinal TB. In the present case, we report the presenting symptoms, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings, and histopathology of a patient with primary sacral tuberculosis that extended into the lower lumbar spine.",0

368,S2210261214004271,"Abdominal tuberculosis mimicking Crohn’s disease’s exacerbation: A clinical, diagnostic and surgical dilemma. A case report"," 2 Presentation of case A 21-year-old man was brought to our Emergency Room presenting with a one-month history of abdominal pain, which had increased during the last 48h. The pain was originally localized in the epigastrium and had migrated to the right lower abdominal quadrant. The patient complained of nausea, diarrhea and weight loss during the last couple of months. Physical examinations revealed abdominal distension with tenderness at the McBurney point, increased peristalsis and fever. The rest of the physical examination was normal. The patient denied any drug or alcohol abuse. The patient had recently been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and treatment had previously been initiated with azathioprine, mesalazine and corticosteroids. Laboratory blood test were in normal range, except for C-reactive protein (209mg/L) and albumin (2,8g/dL). An abdominal CT-scan was performed (Fig. 1 ), displaying moderate ascites, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, diffuse small bowel, and colonic wall thickening, concentrating in the cecum. The chest X-ray was normal. The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which could not be completed due to the patient’s incompliance. The patient was then admitted to the Gastroenterological Unit with the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease exacerbation. Medical treatment was started with corticosteroids, azathioprine, mesalazine, therapeutic monoclonal antibody (adalimumab), and antibiotic therapy. Due to the worsening of symptoms, a sudden increase in the white cell blood count and C-reactive protein and the display of acute abdomen on physical examination, an emergency explorative laparotomy was performed a week after admission. During surgery a distal ileum and right colon wall thickening, signs of perforation and purulent four-quadrant peritonitis were observed. Hence, we decided to perform a right colectomy, with an 80cm terminal ileum resection (Fig. 2 ), an ileostomy on the right side of the abdominal wall and a colonic mucous fistula on the left side. During the postoperative course, the patient was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by an Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli infection. Total parenteral nutrition, and antibiotic therapy with meropenem and metronidazole were started. The histopathological findings of the surgical specimen (Fig. 3 ) revealed a severe distortion of glandular pattern, decreased goblet cell number, crypt abscesses and necrotic areas. This result was consistent with the biopsy obtained during the initial colonoscopy. The presence of necrotic areas in the surgical specimen led the pathologist to consider TB as a differential diagnosis. The key to diagnosis was performing a PCR to identify M. tuberculosis DNA on the tissue in paraffin. M. tubercolosis DNA was detected in a high concentration. After the histological diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis, the patient was started on tuberculosis RIPE therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamid, and ethambutol). A postoperative chest CT scan was performed, showing bilateral pleural effusion (treated with bilateral chest tube placement) but without signs of active TB. Bacterial cultures from the pleural fluid, and from the bronchial lavage were performed and the diagnosis of TB was confirmed. The patient was finally discharged after one hundred days of hospitalization. ",0
369,S0377123717311309,"Determinants of adverse treatment outcomes among patients treated under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program in Wardha, India: Case–control study"," Materials and methods The present case control study was carried out from November 2015 to September 2016 in Wardha TU in Central India. The district has 3 TUs spanning across 8 administrative blocks. The study was carried out in one of the TU (population ?5 lakh). The study population consisted of patients registered under RNTCP in the TU in the year 2014. All patients with any adverse treatment outcome (deaths, defaults, relapse, treatment failure, shift to category IV) were selected as cases (n =91). Simple random sampling was employed for selection of controls from the successfully treated, relapse free patients. The number of controls selected (n =182) were twice the number of cases and an additional 15% (15% of 182 i.e. 27) to account for loss to follow up and non-participation. Thus, the final sample size was 300 (Fig. 1 ). The list of patients along with their illness and treatment details was extracted from the District TB office (DTO). Details about socio-demography, illness, treatment, addiction, work and provider related factors, were obtained by contacting the selected participants individually, using a structured questionnaire and after obtaining written informed consent for participation. The treatment outcomes were determined according to the RNTCP definitions. 14  The area of residence was classified according to census definitions of statutory and census towns. 15  Occupation was classified as unemployed and students, unskilled labours, semi-skilled or skilled labours, and clerical or professional. 16  For socio-economic status (SES) ration cards issued by Government of Maharashtra, under the Public Distribution System was checked (yellow card for Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, orange and white card for Above Poverty Line (APL) families). 17  Indoor air pollution was considered as present only when the family used solid fuel predominantly for cooking purposes, and cross ventilation was lacking in the house. 17  Diseases other than acute infectious conditions e.g. hypertension, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, HIV, anaemia, chronic respiratory diseases, psychiatric illness etc. were considered as co-morbidities. Data was analysed using SPSS 12.0. The characteristics of patients were expressed as frequencies (%), and median (IQR). Univariate logistic regression was performed to study the determinants of adverse treatment outcomes and the strength of association was expressed as Odds Ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence intervals. Multiple logistic regression was performed to derive the adjusted OR to explain the effect of independent determinants on adverse treatment outcomes. All the variables were considered for multiple logistic regression. Multicollinearity was tested using tolerance and variance inflation factor and subsequently the variables type of disease (new/retreatment), smear conversion at end of Intensive Phase (IP), HIV, diabetes, co-morbidities, travel cost, delays in care seeking and diagnosis, family problems, family support, residence of service providers, type of service providers, behaviour of Directly Observed Treatment short-course (DOTS) provider, missed doses were removed from the model due to multicollinearity. Analysis of residuals suggested that there was no significant heteroscedasticity. R 2 (Nagelkerke) for the final model was 39.7%. A P-value of <0.05 was considered as significant. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee before conducting the study. ",0
378,S2213716515001290,Impact of diabetes mellitus on tuberculosis drug resistance in new cases of tuberculosis," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Design A nested case-control study of newly diagnosed TB patients who were admitted to the NRITLD was conducted from May to October 2013. TB diagnosis was made on the basis of a positive smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and PCR. All new TB patients were treated with a standard four-drug regimen (INH, RIF, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 2 months followed by INH and RIF for 4 months) based on national and international guidelines and, if necessary, were changed to other drugs [14]. Baseline laboratory measurements were evaluated at the beginning of treatment. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed for all patients. In addition, a molecular resistance test for INH and RIF was done for all new TB patients with a positive sputum smear. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured in all patients. Newly ascertained DM was diagnosed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, i.e. a FBG?126mg/dL or HbA1c?6.5% [15]. Also, DM was diagnosed if patients had a history of known DM or were receiving antidiabetic agents. For patients with DM, additional evaluation included checking blood glucose and consultation with a nutritionist if deemed necessary by the treating physician. DM patients were managed by proper antidiabetic agents.   2.2 Mycobacteria laboratory The Hain GenoType®MTBDRplus line-probe assay (Hain LifeScience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) for INH and RIF was performed for all patients with smear-positive sputum for the rapid detection of resistance to these drugs. Quality control of the referral laboratory is regularly supervised by the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (Solna, Sweden) and the Research Institute of Tuberculosis of the Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association (Tokyo, Japan).   2.3 Patient selection All new adult pulmonary TB patients with and without DM who were hospitalised in NRITLD were enrolled in this study. DM was diagnosed according to the WHO criteria, namely a FBG?126mg/dL or HbA1c?6.5% [15]. Also, DM was diagnosed if patients had a history of known DM or were receiving antidiabetic agents. TB patients who had DM or newly diagnosed DM were included as cases. For each case, random controls without a history of DM and FBG<126mg/dL or HbA1c<6.5% were selected. For both cases and controls, all pulmonary TB patients had a positive sputum AFB smear, PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and molecular resistance test results.   2.4 Data variables, data sources and data collection Patient data were obtained from a patient TB register into a paper-based pro forma. Data variables included age, sex, smoking status, drug abuse history, new or known DM, duration of symptoms, history of TB contact, presence of a cavitary lesion on chest radiography, grade of sputum smear, FBG level, HbA1c level and final molecular resistance test results. A molecular resistance test was defined as: sensitive if sensitive to both INH and RIF; mono-drug-resistant if resistant to INH or RIF; and multidrug-resistant (MDR) if resistant to both INH and RIF. Data were entered into SPSS v.11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All records were checked for completeness, reliability and precision.   2.5 Data analysis and statistics All demographic and clinical information for TB patients were analyzed using SPSS v.11.5. Categorical variables were compared using the ? 2 or Fisher's exact test, and non-normally distributed continuous variables were compared using the Mann–Whitney U-test. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether DM was independently associated with any drug resistance. Other predictors were included in the model if they were associated with both DM and any drug resistance in bivariate analysis at P <0.2. All reported P-values are two-sided. Thirty-three patients were excluded from the final analysis because there was no M. tuberculosis DNA in their sputum sample.  ",0
379,S1473309917304474,A score to predict and stratify risk of tuberculosis in adult contacts of tuberculosis index cases: a prospective derivation and external validation cohort study," Methods  Study design and participants We did a prospective derivation study in Peru that used data from contacts of index cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in Ventanilla, an area characterised by desert shanty towns in the northern, coastal extension of Lima. This study was followed by an external validation study done in the urban coastal district of Callao, Lima. In both cohorts, index cases were patients registered with government-run health posts who had laboratory-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Contacts were individuals aged 15 years or older who had been in the same house as an index case for more than 6 h/week in the 2 weeks before tuberculosis was diagnosed in the index case. Ethics approval was obtained from the Callao Ministry of Health, Lima, Asociación Benéfica PRISMA, Lima, and Imperial College London, London, UK.   Derivation cohort In 2002–06, we recruited participants from the 15 shanty towns that comprise the Ventanilla district (figure 1 ). Ventanilla is an area of marked poverty, with many people living in wooden or adobe housing with poor access to essential services and utilities. We invited contacts of index cases to complete a baseline nurse assessment of tuberculosis risk factors (table 1 , appendix p 1). Enrolled contacts were followed up until February, 2016, for tuberculosis. For the first 6 months of follow-up we visited households every 2 weeks, during which we offered free sputum smear or culture testing for contacts with tuberculosis symptoms. Thereafter we did household prevalence surveys roughly every 4 years, during which testing was also offered to all contacts. We also asked contacts to self-report tuberculosis diagnosed outside the study area. We ascertained tuberculosis diagnosed within the study area from health-post treatment registers.   Risk score derivation For each year of follow-up, we calculated tuberculosis incidence per 100 person-years. We used Cox regression modelling to investigate factors associated with developing tuberculosis and derive a continuous, integer-point risk score from the exact regression coefficients of the final model. We also assessed multiple interactions terms (table 2 ). We used whole numbers rather than exact regression coefficients to create an easily calculable score for field use. We arbitrarily defined low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups and calculated each contact's 10-year predicted tuberculosis risk with the the exact regression coefficients combined with the baseline survival function (appendix p 2). 8  To assess the calibration of our integer score to a model that used exact regression coefficients, we derived the 10-year observed risk in risk groups and population deciles of the risk score from Kaplan-Meier functions and compared these with the mean 10-year predicted risks in each group or population decile. To assess the added value of including TST results in our score, we derived a multivariable model that included TST results and compared it with our final model.   Risk score assessment and internal validation We calculated the incidence for each risk group, plotted incidence trends, and calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs. Kaplan-Meier functions were plotted to illustrate differences between risk groups in developing tuberculosis after 1, 2·5, 5, and 10 years, and were compared with the log-rank test (appendix p 3). We calculated Harrell's c statistic to assess overall prediction of the continuous risk score. To validate the score internally, we repeatedly fitted the model with 200 bootstrap samples and calculated the optimism-adjusted c statistic (appendix p 3). We calculated the number of contacts needed to treat with preventive therapy in each risk group to prevent one case of tuberculosis over 5 years and 10 years, assuming that preventive therapy was 75% effective on an intention-to-treat basis. 9–11  Finally, because tuberculosis diagnosed in contacts within 6 months of the index case being diagnosed might not be preventable, we did a sensitivity analysis to assess the risk score excluding contacts who had started tuberculosis treatment within this time frame. All analyses were done with STATA (version 13) and all p values were two-sided.   External validation The external validation was done in 17 urban communities in Callao, among participants recruited in 2014–15. This district has marked differences in population demographics, monetary poverty, and material living conditions from Ventanilla (figure 1). 12  Index cases completed baseline nurse assessments in health posts to provide information on themselves, their households, and their contacts. We used these data to calculate a risk score for each contact (appendix p 3). Contacts were followed up with use of the health-post treatment registers to obtain information on tuberculosis diagnoses until March 1, 2017. We used the same statistical methods as in the internal validation to validate the risk score externally.

380,S2212553115001132,A case of tuberculosis and adenocarcinoma coexisting in the same lung lobe," Case report A 44-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency room with a one-day history of nausea and fever. He had no history of significant medical ailments and did not smoke. An initial exam indicated that he was afebrile, had blood pressure of 196/111mmHg, a pulse of 103beats/min, respiratory rate of 18breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination was normal, with no abnormalities on auscultation of the lungs. Laboratory studies indicated an elevated white blood cell count of 10.9×103 cells/?L (local control=3.8–10.7×103 cells/?L) with 81.5% neutrophils (local control=40–79%). C-reactive protein was also elevated at 4.089mg/dL (local control<0.748mg/dL). A chest X-ray showed a suspicious right upper lobe mass with fullness in the right hilum (Fig. 1 ). Computer topography scanning without contrast enhancement showed a soft tissue mass (Fig. 2 ) along with a soft tissue lesion in the right hilum and multiple lytic lesions in the vertebrae, left-humeral head, and sternum. A bone scan to isolate the lytic lesions was performed using 25 millicurie Technetium-99 medronic acid, with results showing multiple foci of increased uptake. Given the location, bronchoscopy was performed to obtain a tissue biopsy of the right upper lobe mass. This showed invasive adenocarcinoma classified as Stage IV due to distal metastasis to the bone [6]. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain mutations were then evaluated in exons 18–21, with a mutation subsequently detected in exon 19. Based on genomic results, he began taking 150mg erlotinib daily to treat the cancer. Pooled lung secretions from the surrounding area were collected and cultured to isolate acid-fast bacilli. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-G; Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) was negative, however, direct amplification of rRNA using the Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct test (MTD; Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA), returned positive results. The presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was confirmed using the BACTEC MGIT 960 Mycobacterial Detection System (Becton Dickson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Maryland, United States) based on susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol. The patient was then placed on 750mg levofloxacin, 300mg isoniazid, 50mg pyridoxine, 2000mg pyrazinamide, and 1600mg ethambutol daily for tuberculosis (TB). This particular drug regimen was chosen given that rifampin, a first-line TB treatment [7], reduces erlotinib efficacy [8]. The patient began taking levofloxacin instead, which has similar efficacy in patients lacking tolerance for rifampin [7]. ",0
382,S2214250914000389,Extrapulmonary tuberculosis presenting as a cavernous sinus syndrome: Case report with review of existing literature," Case report A 48 year old woman presented to her ophthalmologist with complaints of headache and double vision. She first noticed diplopia two months prior to evaluation, which waxed and waned in intensity. One month later, she had recurrent severe diplopia, most prominent on rightward gaze, accompanied by nausea, headache, and photophobia. Her symptoms persisted and progressed to include and right-sided eyelid heaviness. The patient was previously healthy, born in New York City, and had worked in maintenance. Neurologic exam revealed right ptosis, sluggish pupil, lateral gaze palsy, and diminished medial as well as downward gaze. She also had hypoesthesia in the V2 distribution. The patient was afebrile and had no meningeal signs. She had no pulmonary symptoms. Results of complete blood count, routine chemistry, complement testing, and serum ACE were normal. Sedimentation rate was elevated at 49. MRI of the brain was performed, showing an enhancing lesion in the right cavernous sinus (Fig. 1 ). A Quantiferon®-GOLD test was performed as part of the initial work-up, and returned positive (Nil 0.046, TB Ag>10, Mitogen>10, TB-Nil>10). Result of chest X-ray and HIV testing were negative. 18-FDG PET-CT was performed to assess for additional disease sites that would be more amenable to biopsy. PET-CT cuts in the chest revealed a subcarinal mass with intense uptake (SUV of 11). Biopsy of the subcarinal lymph node was performed using a robotic VATS procedure. Lymph node pathology revealed both necrotizing and non-necrotizing granulomas, and cultures subsequently grew M. tuberculosis, susceptible to all first-line drugs. The patient was started on therapy with INH 300mg daily, rifampin 600mg daily, pyrazinamide 1500mg daily, and levofloxacin 750mg daily. Ethambutol was not given because of concern for potential ocular toxicity, given her cranial nerve deficits and diplopia. She was also treated with daily prednisone. Pyrazinamide was discontinued in 3 months, and levofloxacin in four months. She was treated with INH and rifampin to complete a 12 month course. The patient's gaze palsies improved while on therapy, though her facial hypoesthesia persisted. Repeat MRI 3 months into treatment showed improvement of cavernous sinus lesion. MRI after treatment showed near-complete resolution of the lesion (Fig. 2 ). ",0
386,S2210740117301018,A case of esophageal tuberculosis with unusual endoscopic feature,"Esophageal tuberculosis is very rare and primary esophageal tuberculosis is seemingly even more exceptional. Most of the reported cases of esophageal tuberculosis in literature have morphologic appearance as esophageal ulcer, sinus, or fistula [1,2] and EUS features of esophageal lesions usually involves enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes [3,4], which can compress or infiltrate the wall of esophagus [4]. In this case, there was a solid lesion in the wall of esophagus with blue-black color at the base, which was not a typical manifestation of esophageal tuberculosis and could be easily misdiagnosed by doctors in their first impression. Fortunately, biopsy demonstrated caseating granuloma and acid-fast bacilli although they were unusual. This case shows that esophageal tuberculosis may have a variety of endoscopic characteristics and endoscopists should be alert to the possibility of tuberculosis, especially in countries with high prevalence of tuberculosis, even in immunocompetent patients. Moreover, multiple biopsies should be appropriately taken to detect the evidence of tuberculosis infection; even clinical and endoscopic manifestations are not typical.",0

391,S1341321X16300332,Paradoxical reaction to antituberculosis therapy after 6 months of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis: A case report," 2 Case report A 44-year-old man with a smoking history of 24 pack-years, but otherwise unremarkable past medical history, was referred to our hospital because of atelectasis of the left upper pulmonary lobe on a chest X-ray (CXR) at a routine annual checkup. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed atelectasis of the left upper pulmonary lobe, multiple nodular opacities in the right upper and the left lower pulmonary lobes, and calcifications in the collapsed lung as well as in hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 1 ). Sputum smears obtained on 3 consecutive days were negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), but positive for TB by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Sputum cultures were also positive. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and received 2 months of induction chemotherapy, consisting of isoniazid (INH, 300 mg/day), rifampicin (RFP, 600 mg/day), ethambutol (EB, 1000 mg/day), and pyrazinamide (PZA, 1200 mg/day), followed by 4 months of maintenance therapy using INH and RFP. Drug susceptibility testing showed that the isolates were sensitive to all of the anti-TB drugs, and the patient did not have noticeable side effects. Sputum cultures for AFB became negative 45 days after initiation of the drug therapy regimen. Sputum smears were positive for AFB between 3 and 5 months after the initiation of therapy, and PCR assays of sputum specimens remained positive up until 5 months after the initiation of therapy. These findings were attributed to killed mycobacteria. Atelectasis of the left upper pulmonary lobe and other TB lesions were still present after the patient had completed the 6-month regimen. However, nodular opacities in the left lower pulmonary lobe (S6) were worsened and irregularly shaped mass was seen on CXR and chest CT (Figs. 2, 3-a ). This finding suggested exacerbation of TB, development of fungal or other mycobacterial infections, secondary organizing pneumonia (OP) or lung cancer; and the patient was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation. The patient was asymptomatic on admission. His body temperature was 36.8 °C, and SpO2 was 98% (room air). There were no rales or cardiac murmurs on chest auscultation. Laboratory findings were negative for leukocytosis and anemia. The C-reactive protein concentration was 0.14 mg/dL, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm/h. The results of liver and renal function tests were normal, and levels of ?-D glucan and tumor markers were all within normal limits. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 were negative. Sputum smears and cultures were negative for AFB, and cytological examination of the sputum was normal. Bronchoscopy revealed stenosis of the left upper bronchus, compatible with a tuberculous change, but there was no endobronchial lesion. A transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) of the mass in the lower left pulmonary lobe showed caseous necrosis and granulomatosis surrounded by epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 4 ). Smears and cultures of both the TBLB specimen and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative for AFB. The patient was diagnosed with a paradoxical reaction, and he was followed without receiving further anti-TB treatment. Six months later, the mass lesion and atelectasis were both undetectable on chest CT (Fig. 3-b). ",0

No family history or smoking history were noted, although the woman was noted to have a mild but persistent cough. The woman was also a worker involved with lifting heavy loads. The woman identified a metapharyngeal (MP) joint mass in her right wrist and hand, which had persisted for several months (Fig. 1 A). The unmovable soft mass was approximately 2cm×2cm in the MP joint and 4.5cm×4.5cm in the wrist, with local tenderness and limited range of motion. Under the impression of a ganglion cyst, apparently consistent with the soft tissue mass, the woman underwent marginal excision (Fig. 1B), and the pathological report on the wrist tumor revealed it to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Fig. 2 ). Antituberculosis treatment with isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol was prescribed. However, a preoperative chest radiograph revealed a complex mass over the left upper lung (Fig. 3 A), and the patient was then referred to the chest department for further management. Chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans revealed a lobulated 2.4cm×2.5cm mass in the left upper lung field. Lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum was also noted (Fig. 3B–D). A computed-tomography-guided parasternal biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical staging of the lung cancer was T1N3M1, stage IV. The woman then received six courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin (Pharmachemie, Haarlem, Netherlands) and gemcitabine (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and was closely observed in the outpatient department for 1 year. Recurrence was noted and the woman then received chemotherapy with taxotere (Aventis Pharma, Dagenham, Essex, UK). Wrist function remained normal throughout the postoperative period. ",0

Besides mild hepatomegaly, rest of the systemic examination by the pediatrician was found normal. Local examination of the spine revealed a gibbus at the level of D10–D11 vertebrae. There was no redness, abscess, sinus, scar or raised local temperature. There was local spasm of the paraspinal muscle and mild tenderness at the apex of gibbus. Neurological examination including bowel and bladder function was found normal. The hematological investigations were normal except a raised ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) of 50mm/h. The Mantoux test and ELISA for HIV were found negative. Chest X-ray (anteroposterior, Fig. S1a: see the supplementary material associated with this article online) revealed a pathology in the region of D10–D11 vertebrae. Lateral radiograph (Fig. S1b) of the dorsolumbo-sacral spine (DLS) revealed wedging and collapse of D11 and destruction of the D10 vertebra. Non-contrast axial section of CT scan (Fig. S2a) showed destruction of DII vertebra. Contrast enhanced axial section of CT scan (Fig. S2b) showed mild enhancement of pre- and paravertebral soft tissue collection suggestive of an infective pathology without any extradural compression of the spinal cord. CT guided core biopsy was done from the D10 vertebra and material sent for histopathology, cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pyogenic bacilli, and fungi. Histopathology revealed a caseating granuloma with typical tubercular giant cells. Culture was found positive only for M. tuberculosis at the end of six weeks on Lowenstein-Jenson media. A diagnosis of tuberculosis of dorsal spine was made on the basis of clinical, radiological, and histopathological features with a positive culture for M. tuberculosis. Both parents and elder sibling had no history of tuberculosis. Chest X-rays and sputum examination of both parents and the sibling did not reveal any abnormality. Mother was sent to her gynaecologist to rule out endometrial tuberculosis. Endometrial biopsy from the mother revealed a characteristics tubercular histopathology for which she received antitubercular treatment. A diagnosis of congenital tuberculosis was made on the basis of age of the child (gibbus at three weeks of age), hepatomegaly and possible source of infection from asymptomatic maternal endometrial tuberculosis. Child was started on antitubercular treatment with three drugs [rifampicin (10mg/kg), isoniazid (5mg/kg), pyrazinamide (25mg/kg)] for seven months followed by two drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid) for 11 months. Child improved symptomatically, gibbus became less prominent and ESR became normal at the end of one year of treatment. Patient had no recurrence during last two years of follow-up. ",0
404,S2052297517300586,Evaluation of GeneXpert MTB/RIF for determination of rifampicin resistance among new tuberculosis cases in west and northwest Iran," Materials and methods  Bacterial isolates The population under this cross-sectional study consisted of 400 sputum cases of suspected M. tuberculosis infection among new TB cases. Sputum samples were gathered from ten provinces of west and northwest Iran (East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Hamadan, Kurdistan, Zanjan, Ilam, Qazvin, Lorestan and Kermanshah) from March 2014 to November 2014, and moved to the TB reference laboratory of Kermanshah City, Iran. Sputum samples were screened for M. tuberculosis using Ziehl–Neelsen smear and mycobacterial culture [15]. New smear-positive TB cases were cultured on Lowenstein–Jensen medium and M. tuberculosis complex strains were identified on the basis of biochemical tests such as pigment production, niacin, nitrate reduction and the 68°C catalase test [16].   Antimicrobial susceptibility testing Drug susceptibility testing against rifampicin (40 mg/L) and isoniazid (0.2 mg/L) in new smear-positive TB was performed by the proportional method on Lowenstein–Jensen medium. Drug resistance to rifampicin in TB was >1% in the rifampicin-containing media compared with the rifampicin-free media [15].   GeneXpert MTB/RIF This method (Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay G4 version 5) was performed on smear-positive sputum samples according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, after liquidation of sputum by shaking with the kit suspension 10–20 times, 2 mL of specimen was inserted into the GeneXpert MTB/RIF cartridge for PCR testing.   Statistical analysis Sensitivity and specificity of the proportional method and GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay in the diagnosis of drug resistance to rifampicin was calculated using the following formula:    ( Sensitivity = a / a  +  b , Specificity = d / c  +  d )    where a, true positive; b, false positive; c, false negative; d, true negative.

Initially she had followed some private practitioner outside but there was no relief and symptoms got worsened. On examination the patient was conscious, oriented, febrile to touch, cyanosed, tachypneic with respiratory rate of 34/min, pulse of 94b/min and temperature of 100F, BP was 140/82mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 70% only. Systemic examination revealed bilateral course crepitations in the lungs. Rest of the examination was normal. Initial investigations reveal Hb of 10g/dl, TLC of 12,000/uL, DLC of 84% neutrophils and 20% lymphocytes. Platelet count of 120,000. KFT of 40 IU urea and 1.2mg/dl of creatinine. ABG/electrolytes showed pH of 7.34, po2=40mmHg, pco2=45mmHg, Hco3=22meq/L, Na=143, k =3.5 depicting Type 1 respiratory failure. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. Po2/FiO2=198. Chest X-ray (Figs. 1 and 2  ) showed bilateral dense reticulo-nodular pattern interspersed with fine infiltrates. The patient was immediately managed with invasive mechanical ventilation and broad spectrum antibiotics but she did not improve. Influenza retroviral and other virological serologies were negative. Blood and urine culture came sterile. There was no evidence of fungal infection. Bedside echo was done which was normal. Tracheal aspiration showed strong positivity for M. tuberculosis but Monteux test came negative. Subsequently computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 3 ) showed typical miliary pattern of the lungs though there was no evidence of disseminated tuberculosis. So on clinical and radiological suspicion she was put on anti-tubercular therapy. Fortunately after 7days of treatment the patient showed signs of improvement and she was extubated on 12th day of admission. In the meantime culture came positive for M. tuberculosis after 2weeks of culture in Bactec. Hence she was diagnosed as a case of pulmonary tuberculosis presenting as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was discharged on 15th day. She is on our follow up and is doing well. Sputum for acid fast bacilli (AFB) is now negative and is symptomatically much better. ",0

He had no cough, fever, loss of weight, chills, sweating in the night, hemopytsis or other chest symptoms. On general physical examination, the patient was not emaciated and febrile. The examination of the nose, ear was found to be normal. Oral examination revealed left palatine tonsil enlargement with a few white to yellowish plaques on its surface. Indirect laryngoscopy revealed presence of a growth and edema in the left aryepiglottic fold, arytenoid cartilage and piriform fossa. The true and false folds on both sides were normal and mobile. Examination of the neck did not show any cervical Iymphadenopathy and laryngeal crepitus was present. Laboratory tests revealed a total leukocyte count of 10?500/mm3 with 74% polymorphs and 23% lymphocytes. The ESR was 40 mm in the 1st h. Results of acid fast bacillus and fluorescent stains were positive. The consecutive smears and cultures of sputum were positive for acid fast bacilli. The patient showed tuberculin sensitivity to the purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin test, and a scar mark for bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccination was present on his left upper arm. Chest X-ray showed bilateral upper lobe micronodular infiltrates. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was also negative. Direct laryngoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia and biopsy was taken from the left tonsil and arytenoid. Specimens were fixed in formalin. After the dehydration by alcohol at various degrees, the tissue samples were embedded in paraffin blocks and cut in 5 ?m sections for histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Histopathologic examination, of specimens showed a reaction consisting of granuloma formation of epitheloid cells, Langhans’ giant cells, caseation fibrosis, and lymphocytic infiltration (   Figs. 1–4 ). Based on the above investigations, a diagnosis of tuberculosis of the tonsil and larynx with pulmonary tuberculosis was made. The patient was started on antitubercular treatment isoniazid, 300 mg; rifampin, 600 mg; ethambutol, 1500 mg; morfozinamid 2 g daily was initiated. Within 2 weeks the patient had remarkable improvement of his symptoms. Antituberculous treatment of patient is in progress. ",0
427,S1201971215002969,Contacts of retreatment tuberculosis cases with a prior poor treatment outcome are at increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection," 2 Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted using surveillance data from the entire country of Georgia. Only the close contacts of retreatment TB cases (index cases) who were sputum AFB smear-positive at the time of diagnosis as a retreatment case, identified between April and December 2012, were included. Epidemiologists affiliated with the NCDC interviewed each index retreatment case to determine close contacts, defined as members of the same household and non-household contacts who had daily contact with the index patient. Contacts were offered tuberculin skin testing; if they accepted, a tuberculin skin test (TST) was carried out using the Mantoux method, 6  with 0.1ml tuberculin. An induration of ?10mm was defined as a positive TST. LTBI was defined as having a positive TST (the first step of investigation) without symptoms of active TB disease. Contacts with a positive TST were referred to a TB physician for further evaluation, but were not followed up as part of this study. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the risk of LTBI among contacts. The primary exposure of interest was the index patient's outcome of previous TB episode: cure, completion, loss to follow-up, or failure. Treatment outcomes were defined based on WHO definitions. 7  Model building and selection was based on the purposeful selection of covariates strategy. 8  A two-sided p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of Emory University and the Georgian NCDC. ",0
430,S1201971208000568,Primary Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex cutaneous infection: report of two cases and literature review," Case 1 A 76-year-old man presented in August 2005 with a right index ulcer that failed to improve with antibiotics. The ulcer had appeared 4 months earlier following a presumed trauma, although the patient did not recall injuring his finger (Figure 1A). He first noticed an induration over the lateral aspect of his right index that ulcerated 3 weeks later. The ulcer was deep in the dermis, painless, draining purulent material, and was surrounded by swelling that increased progressively. He received repeated courses of antibiotics without improvement. The patient's past medical history was unrevealing. He denied having cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. He is a retired man who lives with his family and had been spending his time lately in his residential garden planting flowers and trees. He did not recall having contact with individuals who were chronically ill or who had a chronic cough. Physical examination revealed a 1×1cm well-demarcated ulcer over the lateral border of the middle phalanx of the right index finger with purulent discharge. The swelling limited the flexion/extension movement of the middle interphalangeal joint. However, the joint demonstrated no evidence of effusion or tenderness. He had no lymphadenopathy or other skin lesions. A skin test with intermediate strength purified protein derivative (PPD) showed an induration of 12mm. The patient had not previously undergone PPD testing and there were no records available for PPD testing in his known close contacts. A chest X-ray was normal. Biopsy of the ulcer showed a granulomatous inflammation with caseation necrosis. Culture of the biopsy specimen grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex after 4 weeks of incubation. The diagnosis of PCTB was then made and the patient was started on isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. The ulcer healed after 12 months of therapy. ",0
431,S0749379700002841,Completeness and timeliness of tuberculosis case reporting: A multistate study," Methods  Study population Selection of the participating sites in this CDC-funded project was based on a competitive process involving review by an objective panel. Results from seven sites that participated in this evaluation are presented. In 1994 and 1995, each site reviewed independent, secondary sources to identify patients diagnosed with TB in 1993, 1994, or both years. The sites included four states—Massachusetts (MA); New York State, excluding New York City (NY); Utah (UT); Washington (WA)—one local health department; San Diego County, California (CA); and three county areas each from two additional states: Florida (FL) and New Jersey (NJ). The participating areas within FL and NJ were analyzed as a single site for each state, for a total of seven sites (see Table 1).     Case definition A case of TB was defined using the CDC 1990 case definition for TB surveillance.6 According to this definition, a case of TB may be defined by laboratory criteria, or in the absence of laboratory information, clinical criteria. The laboratory criteria requires isolation of M. tuberculosis from a clinical specimen or demonstration of M. tuberculosis from a clinical specimen by DNA probe or mycolic acid pattern on high-pressure liquid chromatography or demonstration of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in a clinical specimen when a culture has not or cannot be obtained. The clinical definition requires all of the following: a positive tuberculin skin test; other signs and symptoms compatible with TB such as an abnormal, unstable chest x ray, or clinical evidence of current disease; treatment with two or more anti-TB medications; and a completed diagnostic evaluation.   Case ascertainment To determine possible unreported cases of TB, several different secondary data sources were utilized. All sites reviewed laboratory log books. In addition, other secondary data sources were reviewed by the various sites including death certificates (CA, FL, MA, UT, WA), hospital discharge records (FL, WA), Medicaid databases (CA, FL, WA), and pharmacy databases (CA, FL, MA, WA). Laboratory log books were reviewed and information collected on each positive culture for M. tuberculosis or smear positive for AFB from health department, private, and federal laboratories performing mycobacteriologic studies for TB. A list of laboratories was obtained from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) program. Death certificates were reviewed to identify records which listed underlying or contributory causes of death in the range of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for TB (010.0–018.9). Hospital discharge and automated Medicaid inpatient and outpatient care databases were reviewed to identify TB-related ICD-9 codes (010.0–018.9). Patients receiving anti-TB medications in combinations specific for the treatment of TB (e.g., isoniazid and rifampin) were identified through local pharmacy databases. Finally, several sites utilized additional sources, such as AIDS registries and medical charts from community clinics, to identify possible TB patients (CA, FL, MA, WA). Each potential TB patient identified through the preceding methods was matched by date of birth, name, and gender to the TB database(s) maintained in the respective state or local health department to determine if the patient had been reported to the health department. If the patient could not be found in the TB database(s), available records were then reviewed to determine if the patient was a verified TB case based on the CDC case definition. Sociodemographic, clinical, TB therapy, and medical provider information was collected on each identified case at the seven local sites. In addition, all sites except UT recorded the diagnosis and report dates for each previously reported case. Date of diagnosis was defined as the earlier of the date treatment was initiated, or the date the first positive culture for M. tuberculosis was reported. The difference in the number of days between date of TB diagnosis and date of report to the local or state health department was calculated to determine the timeliness of TB reporting. After the removal of all personal identifiers, data were then sent to CDC for aggregate data analysis using the SAS V. 6.12 statistical software package.7   ",0
438,S1201971217302291,Influence of the identification of contacts on the adherence of index tuberculosis cases to treatment in a high incidence country," Introduction Despite the many efforts made to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) over decades, this disease continues to have new victims. Patients with smear-positive sputum are designated as ‘index cases’ of pulmonary TB. Individuals coexisting with the index case are designated as contacts at the time of diagnosis. An efficient epidemiological surveillance strategy against TB involves recording and conducting diagnostic tests for TB in the contacts of index cases (WHO, 2015a; WHO, 2008; Brasil Ministério da Saúde, 2011). A broader definition establishes that all contacts of an index case with clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB, even with smear-negative sputum, must be examined, because individuals with a low bacillary load can also transmit the disease (Tostmann et al., 2008; Erkens et al., 2010). The examination of contacts aims to identify and treat TB cases in the initial or latent phase of the disease. This procedure intends to prevent the development of the disease in the contacts and thereby interrupt the chain of TB transmission (Hartwig et al., 2008; Freire et al., 2007). It is estimated that 5% to 15% of individuals with latent TB can develop active TB if not treated preventively (WHO, 2015b). This strategy is also necessary to eradicate the disease in low-incidence countries (Erkens et al., 2010). Although efforts to eradicate TB have been implemented by government agencies in Brazil (WHO, 2015c), TB remains a serious public health problem. Brazil has a large geographic area and a wide variation in the rate of TB. Unfortunately, the identification and evaluation of the contacts of newly diagnosed TB cases is neglected in some regions. A previous study conducted in the state of Paraná, Southern Brazil, found that 11% of cases diagnosed with TB had no records of their contacts. This study also indicated that the lack of data on the contacts was associated with treatment dropout by the patients (Furlan et al., 2012). In addition, it is believed that the lack of information on the disease and its transmission helps perpetuate the stigma associated with TB, hindering communication between patients and their potential contacts (Clementino et al., 2011). The disclosure of contacts by the TB index case involves revealing to his/her close friends and family that he/she carries the disease. The healthcare professional who tracks the contacts should interview the TB index case and identify individuals close to him/her by collecting their name, age, address, and telephone number. It is also recommended that home or institutional visits be conducted to characterize the conditions of coexistence of these individuals and the degree of exposure of the contacts, in order to determine the period and environment in which the exposure occurred (Brasil Ministério da Saúde, 2011; Freire et al., 2007; BRASIL, 2011). In Brazil, the health surveillance actions recommended by the government agency in charge include the investigation of contacts of patients younger than 15 years, regardless of the clinical form of TB. In general, these cases are a result of new transmission of TB by smear-positive adults, and the goal of the investigation of these contacts is to identify these adults (WHO, 2015a; Erkens et al., 2010). Previous studies on contact tracing have evaluated the description of these contacts (Freire et al., 2007; Cook et al., 2007), the risk of infection of healthcare workers exposed to patients with TB (Moreira et al., 2010), the percentage of new cases among contacts (Freire et al., 2007; Chakhaia et al., 2014; Morrison et al., 2008; Fox et al., 2013), investigation models and different definitions of contacts (Morrison et al., 2008; Begun et al., 2013; Loredo et al., 2014), and the adherence of health workers to the guidelines of TB control programs (Mulder et al., 2012). However, it appears that no previous study has evaluated the tracing of contacts to assess how this factor may be correlated with adherence to treatment and outcomes in TB index cases. Considering that the state of Paraná has failed to eradicate TB, the objective of this study was to analyze the data regarding the tracing of contacts of new pulmonary TB cases in individuals older than 15 years. In this analysis, it was determined how the variable ‘contact tracing’ could affect the treatment outcomes of patients with TB in the state of Paraná, Brazil. ",0

Clinical examination found a patient eupneique, afebrile, pale conjunctiva slightly discolored, no clubbing and no Claude Berner Omer syndrome. The review of pleuro pulmonary syndrome shows a condensation apical left without pain on palpation of the exquisite coastline. The rest of the physical examination is normal and the lymph nodes are free. Chest X-ray opacity front objective is left grossly rounded apical dense and homogeneous tumour(Figure 1 ), the chest CT scan performed on our patient showed a left apical tissue mass, with some areas of necrosis. This mass in the artery completely sheathes the left subclavian, and adheres to the aortic arch, with infiltration of the pulmonary artery window. The contralateral normal lung parenchyma (Figure 2 ). Bronchoscopy is performed on a small bud at the apex of the sub segmental bronchus of apicodorsale Culminal whose biopsies with histology were returned for revisions of non-specific fibrous tissue with no evidence of specificity and without tumor. Laboratory tests found 14,800/mm3 leukocytes, an inflammatory syndrome with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 125mm/first hour, C reactive protein (CRP) à188mg/l, and an elevated fibrinogen level of 8.90g/l. Protein electrophoresis shows a profile consistent with an inflammatory syndrome associated with a significant increase in polyclonal immunoglobulin. Stock renal, hepatic, phosphorus, and blood dyscrasias were unremarkable. The search for BK in the sputum is done three times and the product of bronchial aspiration is negative. We completed a puncture transparietal that withdrew whitish material which pathological study confirmed as TB by identifying follicular epithelial giant cell with caseous necrosis, and no suspicious cells (Figs. 3 and 4  ). The diagnosis of tuberculosis is selected as pseudo tumor and the patient is on treatment based on four antibacillaires rifampicin (R), Izoniaside (H), Pyrazinamide (Z) and Ethambutol (E) at doses appropriate for weight for a period of 6months with clinical, biological and radiological surveillance.

447,S1198743X16303639,Preventing the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and protecting contacts of infectious cases," Primary MDR-TB transmission Antibiotic resistance first arises when patients with drug-susceptible (DS) TB receive inadequate or interrupted therapy, leading to the selection of drug-resistant bacteria and ‘acquired’ drug resistance [3]. However, once resistant bacteria have become established in an infectious patient, they may then spread to others through airborne droplets as ‘primary’ or transmitted drug resistance. Despite initial evidence that laboratory-induced drug-resistant mutations were associated with a fitness cost and probable reduced transmissibility, evidence from multiple sources indicate that drug-resistant bacteria selected within clinical settings are readily transmissible [4]. Consequently, primary transmission of drug-resistant bacteria is now recognized as the dominant mechanism sustaining the global MDR-TB epidemic [5]. Molecular epidemiological studies indicate that a high proportion of drug-resistant (DR) TB arises from primary transmission [6–8], whereas programme data from 30 low- and middle-income countries showed that a median of 54% (interquartile range 45%–67%) of MDR-TB occurred among patients who have never received TB treatment [9]. Dynamic transmission modelling using programmatic data estimated that 95.9% (95% CI 68.0%–99.6%) of incident MDR-TB is attributable to primary transmission, including 61.3% (95% CI 16.5%–95.2%) of MDR-TB in previously treated individuals [5]. Limiting MDR-TB transmission requires rapid diagnosis and effective treatment, together with optimal infection control and prevention programmes to limit the number of secondary cases [10]. ",0

Her medical history included mild asthma, longstanding left talar arthropathy, and an allergy to penicillin. Clinical examination showed left-sided facial asymmetry with trismus of 10mm, and left masseteric tenderness. Blood tests showed raised C-reactive protein (CRP) of 27mg/L and a normal full blood count. Dental panoramic tomography showed periapical radiolucency associated with the mesial root of the lower left wisdom tooth (Fig. 1 ). Differential diagnosis included acute pericoronitis associated with the lower left wisdom tooth with dysfunction of the TMJ and associated trismus. The left wisdom tooth was removed and she was treated with a five-day course of erythromycin and metronidazole. Two weeks after the extraction she presented again with worsening pain, pyrexia, and increased swelling. Serum blood tests showed an increased CRP of 38mg/L. Mumps serology was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 2 ) showed abnormal soft tissue extending from the left TMJ anteroinferiorly, and inflammation of the masseter with apparent fluid collection caudal to the left TMJ. There was loss of cortex of condylar bone extending into the left mandibular ramus. She was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for a presumed odontogenic infection. Diagnostic ultrasound-guided aspiration of the fluid collection was done, and cytological examination showed scattered polymorphonuclear leucocytes and histiocytes within a blood clot; no malignant cells were seen and culture showed no growth. A revised differential diagnosis included inflammatory or infective arthropathy, myositis or muscle disease with secondary involvement of the bone, unusual lymphoma, TB, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A subsequent HIV test was negative and bone scans showed increased bony metabolism in the left mandibular region and the T12 region of the spine, which suggested metastatic or other focal bony disease (Fig. 3 ). Open biopsy of clinically abnormal precapsular tissue by a minimal preauricular approach was done in March 2009. Further microbiological samples grew fully sensitive M. tuberculosis after eight weeks. She started antituberculous therapy, which included rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for eight weeks. She improved, and mouth opening increased to 28mm three months after treatment began. One year after diagnosis and treatment she started to experience severe pain and limitation in translatory movement of the TMJ. Repeated imaging showed features in keeping with sequelae of the previous tuberculosis (Fig. 4 ), which included destruction of the mandibular condyle with complete loss of the convexity of the condyle and dystrophic calcification with ankylosis. There was no evidence of reactivation or residual collections. A successful prosthetic joint replacement improved the function of the left TMJ. ",0

In particular, the inner aspect of the infant cranial bones had serpentine engravings (serpens endocrania symmetrica, SES), considered to be diagnostic for intra-thoracic inflammation associated with tuberculosis [1,10]. The tubular bones from the infant, and to a lesser extent from the adult, also demonstrated lesions identified as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA), highly suggestive of tuberculosis [1,11]. Encouraging results were also achieved for the PCR amplification and sequencing of the M. tuberculosis DNA insertion elements IS6110 and IS1081, [1] but additional confirmation was desirable. Carefully crafted robust lipid biomarker studies were found to be ideal complements to the above compelling evidence for TB in the Atlit-Yam skeletons [1]. The chosen bone samples were degraded by a proven alkaline hydrolysis [1,2,8], designed to release the maximum amount of mycobacterial lipid biomarkers. Quantitative conversion of the acidic fatty components to pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters gave lipid biomarkers the ability to be separated reproducibly on silica gel cartridges into fractions containing PFB mycolipenate/mycocerosates, PFB mycolates and free phthiocerols (Figure 1). The latter two lipid classes were converted to stable pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) esters, ideal for sensitive fluorescence HPLC, with the PFB mycocerosate/mycolipenates being amenable to NI–CI GC–MS. The assembled lipid biomarker profiles for the Atlit-Yam specimens are shown in Figure 2 . A simple logical sequence is followed for the HPLC characterisation of mycolic acid derivatives. The initial “reverse phase” HPLC (Figure 2A) serves to isolate and observe any C70–C90 mycolates free from any smaller mammalian lipids. A “tight envelope” of total mycolate peaks, as recorded in Figure 2A, is very characteristic for members of the M. tuberculosis complex and, indeed, such clear profiles are immediately very positive indications of tuberculosis infections [5,8]. The next stage is to subject the collected total mycolates (Figure 2A) to “normal phase” HPLC to separate the ?-, methoxy- and ketomycolate classes (Figure 1A) according to their polarity (Figure 2B); if clear peaks are seen for the individual mycolates, this strengthens the diagnosis of TB. Reverse phase HPLC of each of the collected mycolate types (Figure 2B) can provide very diagnostic profiles (Figure 2C–E). The ?-mycolates are relatively homogeneous, a regular series of C76 to C84 homologues (Figure 2C) having two cis-cyclopropane rings (Figure 1A). The oxygenated mycolates, in contrast, comprise two overlapping homologous series with either cis- or trans-cyclopropane rings (Figure 1A). A very diagnostic feature of the methoxymycolates from M. tuberculosis (Figure 2D) is the presence of a double peak comprising the C87 cis-cyclopropyl and C88 trans-cyclopropyl methoxymycolates. Similarly, the ketomycolates from M. tuberculosis are characteristically dominated by the presence of the C87 trans-cyclopropyl ketomycolate (Figure 2E). This sequential analysis enables a close correlation to be observed between the mycolate patterns for the Atlit-Yam specimens and standard M. tuberculosis. To support the positive mycolate results, the mycocerosate/mycolipenate (Figure 1B) and phthiocerol family (Figure 1C) profiles have been prepared, in unpublished studies, using NI–CI GC–MS of PFB esters for the former (Figure 2F–I) and fluorescence HPLC of PBA esters for the latter (Figure 2J). Again, the mycocerosate/mycolipenate traces (Figure 2F–I) correspond well with those for standard M. tuberculosis. Interestingly, the infant showed a stronger presence of mycolipenate (Figure 2, C27 m/z 407). The presence of members of the phthiocerol family (Figure 1C) was revealed by reverse phase HPLC (Figure 2J) for ribs from the Atlit-Yam Infant and Woman. The main components corresponded to the characteristic M. tuberculosis C34 and C36 phthiocerol As (PA) and C33 and C35 phthiodiolones (PO); there was insufficient material to carry out confirmatory normal phase HPLC.   2.2 Seventeen thousand year old bison Natural Trap Cave Wyoming USA Excavations directed by the late Larry D. Martin (1943–2013) of the Biodiversity Institute, University of Kansas, in Natural Trap Cave, Wyoming, revealed the presence of a variety of well-preserved Pleistocene animal bones [2,3]. In particular, a metacarpal from a 17 ka extinct B. antiquus showed evidence of lesions “undermining the articular surface”, associated with tuberculosis both in humans and animals [2,3]. In a landmark study, aDNA characteristic of M. tuberculosis rather than Mycobacterium bovis was clearly identified [12]. A search for lipid biomarkers provided weak but encouraging profiles of mycolic acids (Figure 3 A–E). Remarkably, absolutely pristine profiles of mycolipenic (C27 m/z 407) and mycocerosic acids (Figure 1B) were recorded for specimens taken both at the lesion (Bison 1) and a remote site (Bison 2) (Figure 3F–H). The initial reverse phase HPLC profiles of the PBA derivatives of the phthiocerol family fraction (Figure 3I) were not as clean as those for the Atlit-Yam skeletons (Figure 2J). Normal phase analysis (Figure 3J) of the collected material from the reverse phase separation (Figure 3I) confirmed the presence of members of the phthiocerol family, as published previously [2]. In addition, to the phthiocerols, however, the full normal phase profiles of the PBA derivatives showed the presence of ill-defined more-polar components, labelled X, Y and Z in Figure 3J. The presence of these unknown components was not reported in the initial study [2], as their identity could not be readily understood. One possible explanation is that components X – Z are derived from glycosyl phenolphthiocerols, the deacylated so-called “phenolic” glycolipids (PGLs). To investigate this hypothesis, the PGL from M. bovis BCG was processed through the hydrolysis and extraction protocols and it was found that the resulting PBA derivatives chromatographed in a similar fashion to the components X, Y and Z (data not shown). Unfortunately, none of the X – Z material remained from the bison samples, so it was not possible to make a precise direct comparison. The key conclusion, however, is that the material from Atlit-Yam does not show the presence of these potential biomarkers, possibly derived from PGLs (Figure 2J). Many modern isolates of M. tuberculosis do not produce PGLs, but they are found in M. bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, certain M. tuberculosis Beijing strains and smooth morphology isolates labelled “Mycobacterium canettii”. A recent detailed study [13] has confirmed that “M. canettii” strains are likely ancient progenitors of modern tuberculosis. The aDNA studies [12] ruled out M. bovis, but indicated a similarity with M. africanum. Further studies will be needed to determine the precise strain of tubercle bacillus infecting the Natural Trap Cave bison.  ",0
471,S1438422113000842,First case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission by heart transplantation from donor to recipient," Case We report about a 62-year old male patient who received an orthotopic heart transplantation (HTX) in August 2011 due severe heart insufficiency with a dilatative cardiomyopathy as underlying disease. In April 2009, he was listed on the high urgency level for heart transplantation at Eurotransplant Foundation in Leiden/The Netherlands. While awaiting heart transplantation, a further deterioration of the hemodynamic situation occured, presenting with a decreasing Cardiac Index (CI) of <1.9l/min/m2, together with an unstable hemodynamic situation although receiving high-dose catecholamine therapy. This unstable and progressively worsening situation led to the implantation of a left-ventricular-assist-devise (LVAD, DuraHeart, Terumo Heart Inc. of Ann Arbor, MI, USA) under extracorporal circulation in June 2009. In August 2011, after 26 months bridging time on LVAD, the patient was offered a matching organ from Eurotransplant and subsequently received an orthotopic heart transplantation. The donor was a 31-year old male patient who was admitted to hospital in a severely reduced health and hygiene status, presenting with pneumonia and septic conditions. In the following, acute renal failure developed requiring dialysis. The donor finally died due to an intracerebral bleeding. As underlying diseases chronic alcohol and nicotine abusus, gastrointestinal bleeding with esophagus varices, as well as cirrhosis of the liver were diagnosed, respectively. One day after transplantation we were informed via Eurotransplant that the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the donor, which was performed for diagnostic purposes of the donor's pneumonia, turned positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) by culture. Initially performed Ziehl-Neelsen staining and MBT PCR of the BAL was negative. Although we found it quite unlikely that Mycobacterium tuberculosis was transmitted from the donor to the recipient by the HTX, we put the recipient on prophylactic isoniazid (INH) monotherapy (300mg/d), and drew blood cultures as well as tracheal secretion for tuberculosis diagnostics. The recipient developed renal failure requiring hemofiltration as well as pneumonia, prolonging his intubation and time on respirator. In the following, his liver function continuously deteriorated presenting with markedly elevated liver enzymes (e.g. bilirubin 24.2mg/dl). MARS-therapy (Molecular Adsorbent Recirculation System) was initiated, resulting in an improved liver status. Surprisingly, the initially drawn blood cultures after notification of the positive TB result of the donor turned positive with M. tuberculosis after 3 weeks of incubation. In consequence to this unexpected finding, prophylactic INH monotherapy was replaced by a triple-active TB therapy with streptomycin, ethambutol, and levofloxacin. An incidential finding was excluded, since the donor and recipient were hospitalized in different hospitals approximately 150km away from each other. At that time, the patient had completely recovered from pneumonia, with no more clinical signs (coughing, fever, hypersecretion or even blood staines discharge) nor any suspicious chest X-ray findings. Due to the impaired liver function and immunosuppressive therapy rifampin was avoided. Renal and liver dialysis as well as the other supportive therapy resulted in an improved patient status and the patient could be stabilized and even mobilized. However, by the beginning of November 2011, an unexpected massive intracerebral bleeding occurred and despite all supportive therapy our patient finally died due to this insult. During the whole course after the HTX, the patient never showed signs of an active tuberculosis infection. ",0
477,S1590865803000665,Abdominal tuberculosis with pancreatic involvement: a case report," 2 Case report A 27-year-old white male, born and living in Italy, presented in October 1999 with a 4-month history characterized by weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and weight loss (7 kg). Moreover, he complained of two episodes of acute epigastric pain during this period with radiation to the back associated with fever (38°C). Since the onset of symptoms, the patient had been treated with ceftriaxone (vials, 1 g im bid for 7 days) without any benefit and, occasionally with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, with pain resolution. Due to a further episode of acute epigastric pain, vomiting, fever (40°C) and jaundice, the patient was admitted to our division. Upon admission, laboratory values revealed increased amylase (746 U/l, normal value <44 U/l) and lipase levels (3300 U/l, normal value <190 U/l), a white blood count of 5100/mm3 (66% neutrophils), haemoglobin of 11.7 g/dl, LDH 115 mU/ml (normal value <190), total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dl (direct 0.3), alanine aminotransferase 55 U/l (normal value <40), aspartate aminotransferase 35 U/l (normal value <38), alkaline phosphatase 111 U/l (normal value 80–280), ?-glutamyl transferase 13 U/l (normal value 5–50), Ca 19-9 77.9 UM (normal value <37). Physical examination revealed mild diffuse abdominal pain with no evidence of acute abdomen. No lymph node enlargement was detected. No medical treatment was started. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a ‘multicystic tumour-like’ appearance of the pancreas head with choledochous duct dilatation, confirmed by endoscopic retro-cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which demonstrated distal choledochous stenosis, probably related to external compression, even if the pancreatic duct was not filled. Gadolinium (Gd) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) showed a large mass on the head of the pancreas compressing the main pancreatic duct, with multiple adenopathy (Fig. 1 A–C). Chest X-ray was normal, with no evidence of parenchymal lesions or of pleural effusions, and determination of anti-HIV antibodies was negative. Full written informed consent for explorative laparotomy and possible Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy was obtained from the patient. Laparotomy was performed and during the surgical procedure a large firm mass involving the head of the pancreas and the hepatoduodenal and hepatogastric ligaments was identified with multiple adenopathy in the surrounding area. Enlargement of the spleen and numerous portosystemic venous collaterals along the greater omentum and greater gastric curvature were observed. Multiple small yellow circular areas on the liver were present. Intraoperative frozen section histological examination of multiple nodal biopsies showed granulomas with giant cells and caseous necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy. Surgical pancreatic resection was not performed at that time, but lymph nodes were obtained for specific histological examination. This confirmed the extended necrosis, with caseous granulomatous inflammation of possible tuberculous etiology: Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was positive. Culture of the tissue was found positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In order to exclude urogenital tuberculosis, urine was examined (culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. tuberculosis was performed), with negative results. Specific medical treatment with isoniazid, pyrazinamide and rifampin was started (pyrazinamide was suspended after 10 weeks, and dual therapy with isoniazid and rifampin was continued for a further 6 months) with relief of symptoms and complete resolution of pancreatic damage in 7 months.

481,S235224101400036X,Recurrent non-healing perianal ulcer: A case of tuberculosis cutis orificialis," 2 Case report The presenting case was of a 45year old Saudi man complaining of recurrent painful ulcerative lesions in perianal area that had started about 6yrs back. Initial lesion started as a painful nodule, he sought medical advice in the King Fahad Central Hospital, Jizan and was diagnosed as having perianal sinus and was surgically removed. After one and half year, the same lesion recurred with the same symptoms and was surgically removed in a private hospital in Jeddah. Few months later, again he felt discomfort and a small ulcer started to appear at same site, and with time the ulcer was progressing with seropurulent discharge. It was associated with fever, night sweating, loss of weight, loss of appetite, generalized body ache and occasional abdominal pain and diarrhoea. There was no history of joint pain, cough or any previous medical illness. Also there was no history of similar condition in the family. The patient was a heavy smoker and gat chewer. Physical examination revealed deep ulcer with irregular and undermined border in the perianal area 15×10cm in size with pale granulation and seropurulent discharge (Fig. 1 ). There were multiple, enlarged, non-tender mobile, lymph nodes in the left inguinal area. Abdominal examination showed firm, mobile, non-tender mass in the right lumbar area. There was no ascites nor organomegaly. Cardiovascular and chest examination revealed no abnormality. Laboratory examination disclosed high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80mm/h; normal 1–20) and low haemoglobin (Hb 10g/dl; normal 12–16). Liver function, renal function and blood sugar were normal. Serology for sexually transmitted diseases including syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, C was negative. PCR for human herpes simplex virus, antinuclear factor, ANCA profile and rheumatoid factors was negative. Microbiological cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi both from lesional skin and blood yielded negative result. The tuberculin test was positive (see Fig. 2 ). Instrumental analyses, like chest X-ray was normal but recto-colonoscopy showed multiple, nodular fungating circumferential ulcerating masses in the proximal part of ascending colon and caecum. Multiple biopsies were taken from the colon which showed granulomatous reaction. Gastroenterologists put the differential of tuberculosis, Crohn’s disease, malignancy, basidiobolomycosis and eosinophilic granuloma. Abdominal sonography showed a heterogeneous mass measuring 3×3cm with calcification noted in the right iliac fossa mostly arising from the ileocaecal junction. There was no lymph node enlargement noted in the para-aortic area nor ascites. C.T abdomen-pelvis showed circumferential mucosal thickening involving about 11cm of the caecum and ascending colon with pericecal fat stranding and no proximal ileal dilatation or signs of obstruction, a picture of inflammatory-infection process. Biopsy specimens taken from the edges of the ulcerative lesions showed multiple small caseating granulomas with multinucleated langerhans cells, lymphocytes and histiocytes, a picture consistent with tuberculosis (Fig. 3 ). Acid-fast bacilli were seen in the granuloma and necrotic area by Ziehl-Neelsen stain and were rapidly confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was started on standard anti-TB therapy, consisting of isoniazid 300mg, rifampicin 600mg, pyrazinamide 1000mg, and ethambutol 900mg daily for 2months, followed by an additional 4months therapy with isoniazid and rifampicin. Daily dressing with silver sulfadiazine cream and silver nitrate gauze was done for 6weeks. Follow-up after 2months of initiation of therapy, perianal ulcerations as well as other clinical symptoms completely resolved except some depigmentation in the healed ulcerated area (Fig 4 ). Six months later, the patient’s local and general condition remained unremarkable. ",0
483,S1755001708000456,Autoimmune bicytopenia in pulmonary tuberculosis. Report of a pediatric case," Case report A 11-year-old girl presented to the pediatric A department at Children's hospital of Tunis for a 4-week history of fever and cough. She also complained fatigue and weight loss but no night sweats. There was no history of tubercular contact in the family. She was vaccinated with BCG at birth and had not been receiving any medications on presentation. On examination, the girl was, febrile at 39°C, lethargic and weighing 21kg. The respirations were 24breaths/mn and the pulse was 90beats/mn. The chest auscultation revealed bilateral crackling rales. The remainder of her examination showed nor palpable lymph nodes neither organomegaly. Chest X-Ray showed consolidation right lower lung field (Fig. 1a and b) and CT scans revealed multi lobar involvement with cavities and bronchiectasis (Fig. 2 ). Laboratory tests showed 11.1×109/L white blood cells (85% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 3% eosinophils), 588×109/L platelets and the rate of haemoglobin was at 12.3g/dL. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was at 110mm/h and C reactive protein was at 228mg/l. Haemocultures and cytobacterial sputum tests were negative. Although she received large antibiotherapy with cefotaxim, vancomycin and erythromycin, no clinical improvement has been noted. Tuberculin skin test was nonreactive. Fifteen days after admission, the girl became pale and physical examination noted cutaneous petechiaes in the chest. The haemoglobin rate dropped to 7.8g/dL, (MCV: 87.9 f1; MCH: 27.5pg; reticulocyte count:140.109/L), the platelets count decreased also to 5.109/L. A repeat test confirmed regenerative anaemia (7.7g/dL) and thrombocytopenia at 4.109/L, while white blood cells remained within normal levels. Peripheral blood smear revealed polychromasia, spherocytes, poikilocytosis and a paucity of platelets. Serum bilirubin was at 40?M/L with an indirect fraction at 32?M/L while lactate dehydrogenase rate was at 1200UI/L (normal range 190–445 UI/L). A direct Coomb's test was positive. A repeated test was also positive, and warm agglutinins were detected as the responsible antibodies. Platelet coombs and platelet antibody tests were negative. Serology for mycoplasma, human immuno-deficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein Barr virus were negative. Antinuclear antibody and anti-DNA antibody tests were also negative. Sputum-smear microscopy was positive for acid fast bacilli. Culture, grew mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was sensitive to the first-line drugs. Based on the clinical features and investigations a final diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis with AIHA and IT thrombocytopenia was reached. The patient was started on four anti-tuberculous drugs (rifampicin 300mg, isoniazid 100mg, and pyrazinamid 500mg orally associated to streptomycin 600mg intramuscularly daily). No further haemorrhagic complications were observed. during the thrombocytopenia period. Within two weeks, she became apyretic, and her appetite improved markedly. Simultaneously, the haematological features resolved. The platelet count increased above 50.109/L within 7 days and reached the normal levels within 15 days. The coomb's test became negative at 21 days and the haemoglobin rate increased to 13.5g/dL within 2-months of tuberculosis therapy. Six months later, the girl was well in follow-up. She gained 9kg, and no further haematological anomalies were observed. ",0
487,S0147956314004373,A case of solely lung-involved IgG4-related disease mimicking tuberculosis," Case report A 52-year-old male patient had intermittent cough and bloody sputum two months ago with no reasons. One month later, he had low fever and sought medical attention at the local hospital. He was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and received rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for anti-tuberculosis treatment. The fever and other symptoms were not attenuated. Ten days ago, due to high fever at 39 °C and expectoration of approximately 10 mL fresh blood, he was readmitted into the local hospital. He was then considered as tuberculosis complicated with bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotics including piperacillin–tazobactam, levofloxacin and latamoxef were administered. Meanwhile, he was continuously received the anti-tuberculosis treatment. Because of his deteriorating disease conditions, he was referred to our hospital. He was then transferred to the respiratory ICU following three days treatment at emergency department. He had type 2 diabetes mellitus. His mother had secondary pulmonary tuberculosis. He had a history of pancreatitis 5 years ago. He lost 5 Kg of body weights within 2 months after the disease onset. Physical examination showed he was consciousness; the blood pressure was 86/58 mm Hg; no palpable superficial lymph nodes; reinforcement of tactile fremitus in the upper lobes of both lungs; clear percussion sounds in both lungs; diminished breath sounds in the upper lobes of both lungs. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that: pH 7.47; pCO2 33 mm Hg; pO2 78 mmHg; FiO2 41%; Blood cell counts showed that white blood cells (WBC) 10.8 × 109/L; neutrophils 76%; hemoglobin (Hb) 95 g/L, platelet counts (PLT) 290 × 109/L. Other laboratory tests showed increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (120 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (186 mg/L), decreased albumin (25.9 g/L), significantly increased globulin (39.5 g/L); significantly increased serum IgG (20.6 g/L). IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 were within normal range; PPD skin-test and T-SPOT TB were negative; blood tuberculosis antibody was negative; 4 tests of acid-fast bacilli using liquid-based interlayer vessel technique did not detect acid-fast bacilli. One month prior to his admission to our hospital, his chest CT scan revealed multiple cord-like shadow, patchy and nodular shadow with blurred margins in bilateral middle and upper lobes and dorsal segments of the lower lobes; no enlarged lymph nodes were found within the mediastinum (Fig. 1 A); The lesions mainly distributed in the upper lobes of both lungs and showed polymorphic changes. With reference to the secondary pulmonary tuberculosis history of his mother, the initial diagnosis was pulmonary tuberculosis. However, his disease condition did not improve and the patient developed high fever. The chest CT scan on admission to the emergency department of our hospital showed that the lesions in both lungs were significantly larger than before; multiple lesions coalesced into large patches distributing mostly in the upper lobes of both lungs; the margins were still blurry but clearer than before; no swollen lymph nodes were found in the mediastinum (Fig. 1B). The diagnosis was considered to be secondary pulmonary tuberculosis complicated with bacterial pneumonia. However, his disease condition continued to progress after anti-infective and anti-tuberculous treatment for 3 days. He was transferred into the respiratory ICU subsequently due to aggravated respiratory failure requiring noninvasive assisted ventilation. Reexamined Chest CT (Fig. 1C) showed large flaky and patchy denser shadows of varying density in bilateral upper and lower lobes with blurred margins, in which air bronchogram was observed; the lesion areas expanded significantly in comparison with the previous film. Bronchoscopic diagnosis: bronchitis (the lesions revealed by radiologic imaging were not seen bronchoscopically). Percutaneous lung biopsy was carried out on the date of admission to respiratory ICU. Lung biopsy revealed chronic inflammation, localized purulent changes, fibrosis, unclear alveolar structure, and pulmonary consolidation in the absence of grannulomas. The initial treatment after his admission to the respiratory ICU included anti-bacterial, antituberculous and anti-fungal therapies and continuous non-invasive assisted-ventilation support. On Day 10 of treatment, he experienced tachypnea at 43 times/min, tachycardia at 144 beats/min and systemic cyanosis: Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.34, pCO2 42 mm Hg, pO2 48 mm Hg; invasive ventilation was given accordingly. Bedside chest X-ray film reexamination indicated consolidation of both lungs (Fig. 2 A and B). A pathological reexamination was requested; the pathological reexamination of the submitted tissues reported chronic inflammation, infiltration of abundant plasma cells in the lesion areas, significant fibrosis, unclear alveolar structure, and pulmonary consolidation in the absence of grannulomas. IgG4-related autoimmune disease was with reference to the immunohistochemical results. Immunohistochemical findings showed: CD138 (++), CD38 (+) and IgG4 (?40% +). Special staining: PAS (?), acid-fast staining (?) and digested PAS (?). Serum IgG4 was >10 g/L. Abdominal ultrasound B showed no abnormality of the pancreas. The patient was diagnosed of IgG4-related lung disease. Subsequently, the antituberculosis drugs were discontinued. Serum IgG4 decreased to 5.1 g/L after intravenous administration of 40–160 mg/d methylprednisolone sodium succinate injection for 1 week. More than one month later, blood tests showed WBC 6.6 × 109/L, Hb 92 g/L, PLT 221 × 109/L, Neutrophils 64.5%; CRP 6.00 mg/L, ESR 12.00 mm/h. Chest X-ray reexamination showed diffuse lesions in both lungs (Fig. 2C and D). The patient was discharged from hospital after treatment for 2 months. ",0
494,S0196070906002122,Primary tuberculosis of thyroid gland: a rare case report," 2 Case report Mrs SB, a 22-year-old female patient from the eastern part of India, presented with a midline neck swelling for the last 2 years and an abscess over the left lower part of the same swelling for the last 3 months. On examination, an 8 × 6-cm midline thyroid swelling was found with an abscess in the left inferior aspect (Fig. 1 ). No enlarged neck nodes were found. Indirect laryngoscopic examination revealed no abnormality. Routine investigations were within normal limits except for a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (118 mm/h). The thyroid profile revealed euthyroid status. Fine needle aspiration was done from 2 different sites—(1) from the enlarged right lateral thyroid lobe and (2) from the base of the abscess, which revealed a blood-mixed material and a whitish material, respectively. Fine needle aspiration cytology report showed (1) follicular cells of normal cytomorphology in acinar and papillary formation and (2) epithelioid cell granuloma, caseation such as necrosis with clusters of thyroid follicular cells in the background—suggestive of granulomatous thyroiditis most likely of tuberculous etiology (Fig. 2 ). Pus collected from the abscess was put for routine bacteriologic culture and Zeil-Nelson staining for AFB. Zeil-Nelson stain showed few AFB in the said abscess. Ultra sonography (USG) of the thyroid gland showed a 4.3 × 2.8 × 4.2-cm heterogeneously hypoechoic mass in the left lobe and a same-sized swelling in the right lobe, although it is homogenously echogenic in nature. Computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a thyroid swelling of both lobes (Fig. 3 ). Anti–A60 mycobacterium (IgM) was 1.68 U/mL (positive > 1 U/mL) and anti–A60 mycobacterium (IgG) was 236 U/mL (positive > 200 U/mL). Mantoux test performed with one Tuberculin Unit (1TU) of purified protein derivative (PPD) showed induration of 18 cm after 48 hours (positive). Iodine 131 thyroid scan showed a reduced tracer uptake in the left lobe, whereas in the right lobe, it showed a uniform uptake. In other routine investigations such as chest x-ray, USG of the abdomen failed to reveal any primary foci of tuberculosis. Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done from the tissue obtained from the base of the said abscess, which showed positive results for tuberculous DNA (Fig. 4 ). ",0
507,S0041134517302932,Concurrent Hepatic Tuberculosis and Hepatic Graft-versus-host Disease in an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipient: A Case Report," Case Report A 55-year-old Indonesian female with a history of latent TB, Sjogren's syndrome, and bipolar disorder, was found to have acute myeloid leukemia 3 months after allogeneic HSCT. She presented with fever, abdominal pain, and predominant cholestatic-type liver function tests derangement. Computed tomography scans showed two indeterminate sub-centimeter nodules in the upper lobes of both lungs (enlarged and necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes) and mild splenomegaly with segmental splenic infarction. The liver was relatively unremarkable. The overall radiologic findings suggested an infective/inflammatory etiology. Blood procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels were elevated. Meanwhile, bone marrow aspirate did not show any evidence of leukemic relapse. No bacteria or acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were found on the repeated blood, urine, and stool cultures. Her blood TB quantiferon test (QuantiFERON-TB, Qiagen, USA) was positive, which however would not help differentiate active from latent TB. Polymerase chain reaction tests for cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus were negative, despite persistent cytomegalovirus antigenemia. While under investigation, the patient was started with empiric antibiotics and antifungal agents, and added anti-TB medicine afterwards because of persistent fever. Liver biopsy was performed for deteriorating liver function. Two cores of liver tissue with approximately eight portal tracts showed multiple necrotizing granulomas composed of aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes rimming areas of necrosis, located not only within the portal tracts but also throughout the hepatic lobule (Fig 1 A). Numerous AFB were demonstrated within the granulomas with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) histochemical stain (Fig 1B). No fungal organisms were observed with Grocott's methenamine silver and periodic acid–Schiff stains. Although only few portal tracts were visualized, most of them showed a sparse mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils (Fig 2 A). Eosinophils were not readily observed. The bile ducts also showed features of injury, with attenuated small profiles coupled with reactive nuclear atypia. Furthermore, few scattered eosinophilic apoptotic bodies were discerned (Fig 2B). Patchy mild areas of intracanalicular cholestasis were noted. There was no periportal inflammation. Few foci of lobular inflammation were present (3 foci on a 10× objective). There was no significant steatosis. Features of mild portal hepatitis with prominent bile duct injury and scattered apoptotic bodies were compatible with GVHD. Connective tissue stains showed portal-only fibrosis. There was grade 1 hemosiderosis with Perls' Prussian Blue histochemical stain. Diagnosis of concurrent hepatic TB and GVHD was made on the liver biopsy. During investigation, the patient was clinically suspicious for intestinal TB due to several enlarged and necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes shown on the computed tomographic scan. The patient also had a papule over her left thigh, skin biopsy of which revealed a dermal necrotic focus containing nuclear debris and AFB (Fig 1C and 1D). Immunohistochemical stains, including myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD117, and MIB1, suggested no obvious features of a leukemic infiltrate. Approximately 2 weeks later, cutaneous and colonic GVHD was discovered through further biopsies as well. Skin biopsy from the right thigh showed interface and spongiotic dermatitis, which is consistent with grade 2 GVHD. The epidermis showed basal vacuolation with mild spongiosis and a few scattered apoptotic keratinocytes (Fig 2C). Colonic biopsy, performed due to diarrhea, showed features of mild GVHD. There were small numbers of basal apoptotic cells in several crypts associated with focal crypt distortion (Fig 2D). ",0
510,S1472979217300239,A novel automatic molecular test for detection of multidrug resistance tuberculosis in sputum specimen: A case control study," 2 Results A total of 224 specimens were tested for validation. Thirteen specimens were excluded from final analysis because of culture contamination, Xpert MTB/RIF or ML TB test failure. Among the 211 specimens, 166 were culture positive and 3 specimens were identified as Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) by molecular identification.  2.1 Performance of ML TB for detecting MTBC The performance of ML TB for the diagnosis of MTBC is shown in Table 2  . The overall sensitivity of the assay was 95.1% (155/163). The sensitivity in smear-positive culture-positive cases was 98.0% (146/149), whereas in smear-negative culture-positive cases, it was 64.3% (9/14), which was significantly lower than that in smear-positive culture-positive group (P < 0.01). The specificity for the diagnosis of TB was 88.9% for ML TB (40/45). We also compared the performance for deterring MTBC between MLTB and Xpert MTB/RIF. The sensitivity of these two assays was similar on smear positive specimen. However, the sensitivity of ML TB on smear negative and culture specimen was significantly lower than the Xpert MTB/RIF (P < 0.01).   2.2 The performance of ML TB for detection of RIF and INH resistance 153 specimens among 163 culture positive specimens got RIF and INH resistance results by ML TB test. MLTB identified 33 samples as RIF resistant among 37 isolates which were identified as resistant to RIF by MGIT DST, indicating an overall sensitivity of 89.2% (Table 3 ). For 4 specimens identified as RIF susceptible by ML TB, 3 out of 4 cases showed no genotypic mutation within rpoB gene by sequence. In addition, the overall specificity of ML TB for RIF susceptibility was 95.7%. For 5 specimens identified as RIF resistance results by ML TB, further DNA sequencing analysis revealed that 3 were confirmed to be genotypically resistant by sequencing of rpoB gene. The overall sensitivity of ML TB was 78.3% for the detection of INH resistance. Among the 10 phenotypically resistant strains showing sensitive at the inhA and katG genes, sequencing results revealed that all of them carried no mutations in these two genes. We also calculated the specificity of ML TB for detecting INH resistance, overall specificity of 98.1% (Table 3).   2.3 Comparison of ML TB and Xpert MTB/RIF for detection of RIF resistance A total of 159 specimens among 163 culture positive specimens got results successfully by Xpert MTB/RIF. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, the ML TB test showed similar sensitivity (89.2%VS 89.5%) and specificity (95.7% VS 95.0%) for detection of RIF resistance (Table 4 ).  ",0
513,S1529943013017270,Cervical tuberculosis associated with cervical pain and neurologic deficit: a case report and literature review," Case report  History and symptoms The patient, a 20-year-old farmer, had presented to a primary care hospital 5 weeks before being referred to our hospital. At the primary hospital, a diagnosis of mechanical neck pain was made solely based on findings of a normal complete blood count and a normal cervical spine radiograph. On referral and admission to our hospital, the patient's most outstanding complaints were limb weakness, paresthesia, and difficulty walking. The patient also complained about a 2-month history of aggravating neck pain, a 1-month history of a slowly growing lump at the back of the neck, and numbness and weakness of the right arm that had gradually progressed to involve all the limbs for 2 weeks before presentation. The patient had incidentally noticed a painless neck lump that was not associated with any history of fever, weight loss, or local trauma.   Findings from physical examination and laboratory and visualization studies Examination of the neck revealed a smooth and well-defined swelling. The overlying skin was normal and freely mobile over the swelling. The pain was aggravated by pressing on top of the head and by rotating it. Neurologic examination revealed that sensation decreased caudally from the C6 cord segment, muscle strength of the arms and limbs decreased from Grade 5 to 3, both the knee and ankle jerks were brisk, and on both sides, the Hoffmann sign was negative and the Babinski sign was positive. All the signs of incomplete tetraplegia suggested the presence of an upper motor lesion. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were undetectable. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 43 mm/h, and the concentration of C-reactive protein was 28 mg/L. A lateral radiograph (Fig. 1 ) of the cervical spine taken on admission showed severe atlantoaxial luxation without atlantooccipital instability. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans (Fig. 2 ) showed flake-like bony destruction located in the spinous process and at the right laminae of C2. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine (Fig. 3 ) showed a large swelling, size 4×3×3 cm3, posterior to C2, deep to the paravertebral muscles with communication with the spinal canal and atlantoaxial luxation-induced distinct compression of the spinal cord. C1 and the odontoid process of C2 remained intact. The remainder of the cervical spine and spinal cord appeared to have a normal structure normally aligned.   Diagnosis and treatment Based on these findings, we diagnosed either TB or a tumor. To enable us to distinguish between these two possibilities, the patient underwent a whole-body positron emission CT that revealed a cervical cold abscess without the evidence of disease in any other part of his body. Our primary diagnosis was cervical TB. A CT-guided bone biopsy of the lesion showed a necrotizing granuloma, a culture of which grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We believed that initial treatment should comprise recovering cervical alignment, alleviating the spinal cord compression, and treating the infection. Therefore, the patient, whose neurologic loss was graded at Frankel C, was subjected to 2 weeks of skull traction and quadruple anti-TB treatment. The patient's neurologic function gradually improved and was Frankel level D 1 week after skull traction. A radiograph taken at the bedside showed ideal reduction of the atlantoaxial dislocation. Then the patient underwent reconstructive surgery to reestablish upper cervical vertebral stability. Surgery included posterior radical debridement, decompression, internal fixation with a screw-rod system from C1 to C4, grafting of the autologous iliac crest bone, and fusion. After debridement, setting the screw at C2 was very difficult, so we chose C1, C3, and C4 as the fixation and fusion segments to attain sustained stability. Cultures of pus and bone grew acid-fast bacilli and histopathologic examination of the tissue from the lump showed granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid cells and caseous necrosis. All these are features are consistent with the diagnosis of TB. After surgery, the patient stayed in bed for 2 months, and when he walked, he wore a cervical brace. Antitubercular treatment was continued for 12 months postsurgically. The patient experienced no recurrent lump, neck pain, or new neurologic deficits during the 1-year follow-up period. Radiographic and CT scans at the 1-year follow-up did not show evidence of the tuberculous lesion (Fig. 4 ). At 2-year follow-up, full extension-flexion radiograph revealed satisfactory stability at C1–C2 and no indication of fixation failure (Fig. 5 ) and a CT scan showed that satisfactory bony fusion had been achieved at C1–C2 (Fig. 6 ). One year after the surgery the patient had normal neurologic function, normal knee and ankle jerks, negative Babinski sign on both sides, and a Frankel grade of E, and he returned to work.  ",0
518,S1870199X16300696,Diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis: Systematic analysis of literature and study of seven cases in the cervicofacial region," MATERIAL AND METHODS A convenience selection of patients treated in 2012-2014 at the Regional Hospital «Ignacio Zaragoza» (ISSSTE) was conducted. Patients had been diagnosed with tuberculosis and were residing in the eastern area of Mexico City. These four cases were selected due to diagnosis controversy. In selected cases, FNAB (fine needle aspiration biopsy) diagnostic tests were conducted as well as thorax X-rays, tomograms, Ziehl-Neelsen test, Lowenstein- Jensen culture and positive immunohistochemistry to Mycobacterium tuberculosum. Definite diagnosis was achieved with three out of the six positive tests. In anamnesis, patients of this selected sampling informed of middle social and financial status, practice of adequate hygiene habits, lack of crowding, and absence of related hereditary familial history.

521,S2214541918300099,Mandibular tuberculosis presenting as a squamous cell carcinoma," 2 Case report A forty-six-year-old Bengali male presented with a history of a large non-healing ulcer of the lower left alveolar region of the mandible. He denied any relevant systemic medical condition but appeared malnourished. Socially, he disclosed a historic smoking habit, stopping 10 years previously, and a decrease of alcoholic intake from over 30 units/week to 10 units/week.  ?  Clinical presentation     Extra-orally, he presented with palpable level Ib, II and V lymph nodes. Intra-oral examination revealed an approximately 2?cm?×?1?cm ulcerated mass with rolled edges of the alveolar region of his left mandible and associated neurosensory disturbance of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve causing lower lip paraesthesia. He also presented with a neglected dentition, and severe generalised periodontitis, Fig. 1 .  ?  Investigations       Radiology:  A dental panoramic tomography (DPT) image demonstrated an osteolytic lesion of the left body of the mandible measuring approximately 2cm. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) confirmed focal destruction extending from the lower left incisor to the lower left molar region with destruction of the lamina dura and part of the inferior alveolar nerve canal wall, as well as extensive destruction of the buccal cortex and erosion through the lingual cortex of the mandible, Fig. 2 . Given the initial clinical picture and the baseline DPT, a working diagnosis of SCC was presumed, and therefore further investigations initiated to aid surgical planning and staging. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest excluded metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the soft tissue extension, thus providing a working diagnosis of left mandibular SCC with bony destruction and necrotic lymphadenopathy along the ipsilateral level I and II neck nodes.   Histopathology:  An urgent incisional biopsy under local anaesthetic revealed necrotising granulomatous inflammation. Although acid-fast bacilli were not identified on the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, the modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain (Wade-Fite) confirmed diagnosis to be consistent with tuberculosis. The patient was then urgently referred to the respiratory physicians for further investigations.   Microbiology : Mantoux skin test and Quantiferon-TB gold assay sputum were performed by the specialist TB team. Quantiferon-TB gold enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001 to aid the detection of the M. tuberculosis complex [9]. Neither test provided evidence of active TB in this patient. Virology tests including potential co-infection of HIV were negative. Routine biochemistry and haematological investigations did not reveal an underlying systemic cause. This unusual case was then discussed by the head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), following which a consensus diagnosis of TB was reached.  ?  Treatment     His treatment involved local surgical debridement without grafting under local anaesthetic, as well as anti-tubercular therapy. He commenced a six-month course, comprising two months intensive therapy with Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide and maintenance therapy of four months with Rifampicin and Isoniazid.  ?  Follow-up     The patient was reviewed six months following his anti-tubercular therapy. Evidence of radiographic bony infill and healing of the osteolytic lesion was documented, Fig. 3 . Improvements of his lower left lip paraesthesia was reported subjectively by the patient and confirmed on clinical examination. ",0

528,S1473309916302596,The number of privately treated tuberculosis cases in India: an estimation from drug sales data," Methods  Overview We drew from a large, nationally representative dataset for private sector drug sales across the country, collected by the organisation IMS Health. We limited the analysis to 189 drugs containing rifampicin, which have fewer non-tuberculosis indications than, for example, fluoroquinolones. These 189 products capture all rifampicin-containing drugs being sold in India between 2013 and 2014. All products were fixed-dose combinations or branded drugs: they were thus sold only in the private sector and not the public sector, which uses different product forms (including loose pills) under non-proprietary names.     Research in context     Evidence before this study  Not all incident cases of tuberculosis are reported to public health authorities: WHO estimates overall tuberculosis incidence in India by estimating the proportion of incident cases that are notified (the case detection rate [CDR]), and dividing published tuberculosis notifications by this fraction. In 2014, this approach suggested that over 800?000 tuberculosis cases in India escaped diagnosis by the public health-care system: most of these cases are assumed to have been treated in the private sector. However, CDR estimates are based on expert opinion, with the most recent estimate varying substantially from previous years. We searched PubMed for all studies with keywords “India”, “tuberculosis”, “private”, and “burden”, finding 25 studies for articles published in English from inception until May 31, 2016. Most of these related to the quality of tuberculosis care, whereas one study from 2011 assessed the amount of drug sales in the private sector in India and nine other countries. With a focus on market size estimates, this study also presented an illustrative estimate for how many patients were on treatment for tuberculosis.  Added value of this study  There is a need for systematic estimates of private sector tuberculosis burden that are independent of expert opinion. We used updated data from 2013 and 2014 for anti-tuberculosis drug sales in the private sector in India, adjusted for indication of use and data capture. With that empirical data, we built on previous work by systematically exploring the effect of assumptions of duration of treatment, and the extent of over-diagnosis of tuberculosis, on the number of patients treated in the private sector. Although there is limited evidence for either of these parameters, we modelled a range of scenarios to assess the feasibility of current estimates based on expert opinion.  Implications of all the available evidence  Tuberculosis treatment in the private sector is considerably greater than previous estimates suggest, and estimates of tuberculosis disease burden for India are implausibly low. This study illustrates the need to address the burden of tuberculosis treated by the private sector and improve surveillance. This study also raises an urgent need to revise current estimates of tuberculosis burden, informed by more systematic evidence relating to tuberculosis management in the private sector.      We aimed to estimate the treatment volume, or the total patient-months of treatment for tuberculosis in the private sector, taking account of both the proportion of prescriptions for a given drug that are for tuberculosis, and the proportion of total drug sales that are captured by IMS Health data. We found estimates at the state level in India, as well as on the national level, for 2013 and 2014. We also estimated 95% credible intervals, informed by uncertainty in the input parameters.   Calculating volume (patient-months) of treatment Each product is uniquely identified by its product code, indexed i in the analysis. We define the following parameters for data in a given state and year: Ni  is the IMS data for total packs of product i sold, ci  is the proportion of total sales of product i that are captured by IMS data, mi  is the total months of tuberculosis treatment represented by one pack of product i, and pi  is the proportion of prescriptions containing product i that are for tuberculosis. When each of these quantities is specified, the total number of patient-months of treatment (PM), in a given state and year, is then given by a sum over all product codes i: 						    PM =  ? i      N i     C i     m i   p i        That is, adjusting sales data (Ni ) for IMS data coverage (ci ), the duration of treatment associated with each product form (mi ) and the indications for tuberculosis versus other diseases (pi ). Ni  is measured directly. In practice, each of the remaining parameters carries some uncertainty, which we captured by modelling them as random variables, using distributions described below. Using Latin hypercube sampling, we took 10?000 samples for each of the parameters (ci , mi , and pi  over all product codes i), and then calculated PM for each sample using the equation. From the resulting ensemble of 10?000 estimates for PM, we then obtained the point estimate for the patient-months using the median, and the uncertainty intervals using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles. We then repeated this process for each state and year.   Data sources and probability distributions for input parameters For the total drug sales Ni  we used state-specific data from the IMS Health Drug Sales Audit. These are monthly drug sales data reported to IMS Health by a recruited panel of stockists. We collected monthly drug sales data using invoices raised for sales of goods to retailers and sub-stockists, hospitals and hospital retailers, and dispensing doctors. Overall, IMS Health's combined drug sales audit in the retail, hospital, and dispensing doctors sectors was estimated to account for over 87% of the total Indian pharmaceutical market in 2014. 11   For the proportion of prescriptions pi  of product i that are for tuberculosis, we drew from the IMS Medical Health Audit, consisting of monthly prescription data from a panel of 4600 doctors following internationally recognised medical practice, and translating to over 800?000 prescriptions every month. The panel of doctors is recruited through a sampling exercise that takes into account the region, specialty type, and patient turnover. In these data, if product i has P prescriptions of which T are for tuberculosis, then we modelled pi  as a ?-distributed random variable, with shape and scale parameters T?+?1 and P?–?T?+?1, respectively. Data are available at the regional level, but not at the state level. Accordingly, for each state we selected the data from the relevant region. For mi , we again drew from the Medical Health Audit data. In particular, prescriptions of product code i have a certain frequency distribution, available from the audits. Putting this together with the duration of treatment associated with each dose, we constructed the probability distribution for the number of months associated with each prescription of product code i. Again, since these data are only regionally stratified, for each state we used the corresponding, region-specific estimates. Finally for ci , we used data from IMS Health data validation studies. In brief, at the end of each year, pharmaceutical companies subscribed to IMS are supplied with IMS estimates for their yearly sales volume, for comparison with their actual sales volume. Not all rifampicin-containing products are included in these studies. Accordingly, for each product code in the present work (analysis products), we estimated ci  using those products in the validation study (validation products) having a comparable volume of sales. In particular, we grouped validation products by volume (whether high, moderate, or low volume products), found the mean and variance for each volume category, and then modelled IMS coverage within each category as a normal distribution. By categorising analysis products in the same way, we modelled ci  for each required product using the normal distribution from the relevant volume category.   Implications of treatment volume for burden (numbers of patients) Given an estimate of PM in a given year, the corresponding number of patients receiving tuberculosis treatment is given by PM?/?D, where D is the average duration (in months) for which patients take tuberculosis treatment in the private sector. However, not all of these patients might genuinely have tuberculosis. To adjust for potential overdiagnosis, we incorporated the positive predictive value (PPV) of tuberculosis diagnosis in the private sector (ie, the proportion of people diagnosed with tuberculosis in the private sector who genuinely have tuberculosis). Therefore, overall the number of patients with tuberculosis receiving private-sector treatment in a given year is estimated simply as PM?×?(PPV?/?D). In the absence of systematic, quantitative estimates for these parameters, we present results for a range of scenarios for PPV and D.    Patient-months of treatment in the public sector To compare against the amount of treatment in the public sector, we used RNTCP notifications and, for simplicity, assumed 6 months of treatment for new cases and 9 months of treatment for retreatment. Because some patients might not complete treatment even in the public sector, this approach yields an upper bound for patient-months of treatment. Consequently, this approach would tend to be conservative with respect to the relative amount of treatment in the private versus public sectors (ie, tending to underestimate this quantity).

536,S120197121401738X,A case of visceral leishmaniasis and pulmonary tuberculosis in a post-partum woman," 2 Case presentation In January 2014, a previously healthy Romanian female aged 22 years, recently immigrated from Eastern Europe, was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the University Hospital of Palermo, Italy, due to fever, headache and sweats. The symptoms had begun six days before, a few hours after delivery. On admission, the patient was febrile (body temperature 37.7°C); blood pressure 110/70mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 97%. The complete blood count demonstrated a white blood cell count of 2850 cells/mm3, haemoglobin 11.8g/dL, platelets 84000-111000 cells/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48mm/h, C-reactive protein 9.12mg/dL and a very slight increase of gamma globulins (19.3% at the serum protein electrophoresis, range value 10,5- 18,8). Physical examination demonstrated hepatosplenomegaly, confirmed by ultrasound (spleen size approximately 20cm). A chest X-ray demonstrated radiopaque rounded areolas in the right superior-middle and left middle lung fields. Blood cultures were performed and resulted negative; empiric anti-microbial therapy with meropenem, amikacin and clindamycin was initiated without improvement. Persistent fever, progressive anemia, splenomegaly and a history of a first daughter recently treated for leishmaniasis led us to perform specific testing for antileishmanial antibodies. Immunofluorescent antibody-test (IFAT) test was positive 1:3200; ELISA IgG positive. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on blood and on bone marrow aspirate for detection of leishmania-DNA were both positive (1200 n.leish/ml on blood; 5500 n.leish/ml on bone marrow aspirate). Light-microscopic examination of the stained bone marrow specimen was positive for Leishmania amastigotes. Therapy was initiated with liposomal amphotericin B (l-AmB) at the dosage of 3mg/kg at days 1–5 and at day 10. The patient defervesced and clinically improved. Because of a positive (20mm) tuberculin skin test (TST), an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (1,04 IU/ml) (QuantiFERON-TB Gold, Cellestis, Ltd., Carnegie, Australia) was performed and confirmed immune reactivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). A computed tomography of the chest demonstrated the presence of numerous nodules in the right upper lobe, images of micronodulia as “tree-in-bud”, and interstitial thickening in the right middle lobe and in the left apical-dorsal segments. These findings were suspicious for pulmonary TB, so bronchoscopy was performed. A bronchoalveolar lavage specimen was positive for Mtb PCR, and cultures grew Mtb which was susceptible to rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. She was started on standard 4-drug TB therapy. The newborn was investigated for Leishmaniasis, the serological test was positive and consistent with the result obtained from the mother, but PCR for leishmania-DNA on peripheral blood resulted negative. The infant also was evaluated for tuberculosis with TST test and chest radiography, according to CDC guidelines, and resulted negative. ",0
552,S2211419X16300854,Focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated tuberculosis (FASH) case series from a Rwandan district hospital," Introduction Over six million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) were diagnosed worldwide in 2014, 1  and approximately 15–20% of all TB cases are extra-pulmonary (EPTB). 2  HIV-infected persons are up to twenty-six times more likely to develop TB compared with those who are HIV-negative. The majority of these HIV-TB co-infection cases (78%) is reported in sub-Saharan Africa. 1   In the setting of advanced HIV, the diagnosis of TB may be more difficult due to atypical clinical presentations, undiagnosed HIV infection, and disease involvement of occult sites, where sputum testing is often negative for mycobacteria. 2  The risk of developing extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) increases as immune deficiency progresses, with studies showing 45–56% prevalence of EPTB in AIDS cases. 1  This combination of factors results in a high proportion of undiagnosed TB found in autopsy studies of HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa. 1   Clinicians trained in ultrasound use are often scarce in low-resource settings where EPTB may be more prevalent. However, when available, ultrasonography can be a helpful adjunct in identifying and treating abnormal EPTB-associated findings using the focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated TB (FASH) protocol. 3  EPTB commonly manifests as abdominal TB, pleural or pericardial effusions. This ultrasound protocol evaluates for the presence of pathological fluid collections in the pleural, pericardial and peritoneal spaces, abdominal lymphadenopathy, and hypoechoic lesions in the spleen or liver (concerning for abscess) which may be seen in HIV and TB co-infected patients. 4  A definitive diagnosis of TB can only be made by culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms from a specimen obtained from the patient, and EPTB treatment includes anti-TB medications as well as addressing focal findings as clinically indicated, such as draining pericardial or pleural effusions. Suspected cases of EPTB should also be assessed for concomitant pulmonary TB. The three cases described herein add to the literature by demonstrating the further clinical information that can be obtained by incorporating point-of-care ultrasound and the FASH protocol into the evaluation of HIV patients with concern for EPTB. These cases were managed by a Rwandan emergency physician with training in point-of-care ultrasound working at a district hospital reporting an average of 100 cases of TB per year. 5  All patients verbally consented to inclusion in this case series. Masaka District Hospital is an urban 150 bed mid-level hospital in Kicukiro District, Kigali. It serves a population of 320,000 people, 6  and is staffed by general practitioner physicians and registered nurses. There is one emergency medicine trainee with an on-site rotation at this hospital for a period of one year. Available resources include an emergency centre, basic laboratory testing, X-ray in radiology area (but not portable to the emergency centre), and point-of-care ultrasound if a trained clinician is present. There is no dedicated sonographer or radiologist for the hospital, and no on-site CT capacity. GeneXpert testing for TB is only available as a send-out test. ",0

FNA cytology revealed granuloma with multinucleated cells in all patients and AFB stain was positive in 2 of them (40%) (Figures 1 and 2  ). TB PCR was sent for only one patient (Sr No 4) and was positive. All of them had remarkable clinical improvement after standard ant tuberculosis treatment (Table 1 ).  Procedure-EUS Guided FNA In all the cases, informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. Midazolam and pentazocine was used for sedation. Blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen saturation was monitored throughout the procedure. A linear array echoendoscope (GFUCT180; Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was used for endosonography. EUS probe was localized to stomach and surrounding omentum was surveyed. Thickened omentum was identified. Trans gastric FNA via the anterior wall of stomach, was obtained with the help of a 22G needle (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). Four passes of two suspected deposits, with 20 to and fro movements during each pass without negative pressure, were used to aspirate the tissue (Figures 3 and 4  ). Slides were both alcohol fixed and air dried. Cytology evaluation was done by cytopathologist at pathology unit.  ",0
584,S221255311630053X,Genital tuberculosis: Unusual presentations," Discussion Genital tract tuberculosis (TB) is usually secondary to extragenital TB. The upper genital tract is usually involved in genital TB, affecting fallopian tubes and endometrium. Cervical TB is uncommon, responsible for 0.1–0.65% of all cases of TB and 5–24% of genital tract TB [1]. TB of the vulva is even rarer and is seen in only 1–2% of cases of genital tract TB [2]. The incidence of genital TB is higher in developing countries. With the rising incidence of HIV infection, associated genital TB incidence is on the rise. Approximately 9% of all extrapulmonary TB cases are genital tract TB [3]. Fallopian tubes and ovaries are commonly involved, with other pelvic organs such as the vagina, vulva, myometrium, and cervix less commonly so. Spread to these sites is either by hematogenous, lymphatic dissemination, or direct extension. About half of the patients are asymptomatic. Besides constitutional symptoms, symptomatic cases usually present with abnormal vaginal bleeding, menstrual irregularities, abdominal pain, and local ulcers [4]. TB of the uterine cervix may present as papillary or vegetative growth with or without ulceration mimicking invasive cervical cancer. Agrawal et al. [5] and Elkattan et al. [6] reported two such cases of cervical TB that simulated cervical carcinoma. Vulval TB was first described by Bates and Rucker [7]. Lesions are usually ulcerative. Kaur and colleagues [8] described such a case of vulval TB that presented as an ulcerative lesion. A hypertrophic variety of vulval TB is very uncommon; such a case was described by Tiwari et al. [9]. Suppuration and ulceration of the inguinal lymph nodes may occur. The diagnosis of the cervical and vulvovaginal TB is usually made by histological examination of cervical and vulvovaginal biopsy specimens, respectively. Isolation of mycobacterium is the gold standard for diagnosis. Presence of typical granulomata is sufficient for diagnosis. Culture may not be very useful as about a third of cases turn out to be negative. Also, staining for acid-fast bacilli may be unyielding [10]. Newer diagnostic tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction may help in earlier detection of TB. Concomitant HIV testing should also be done, especially in areas with high HIV prevalence. There should be a high index of suspicion of genital TB in women from areas where HIV and TB are common. One such case was reported by Lamba et al. [11] where a patient who attended a genitourinary clinic was found to have cervical TB in association with HIV infection. The differential diagnosis for granulomatous disease of the cervix includes amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, brucellosis, tularaemia, sarcoidosis, and foreign body reaction [12]. Few ulcerative lesions may simulate invasive cervical cancer. A vulval tubercular ulcer may also be misdiagnosed as syphilis or chancroid, and rarely as vulval malignancy. ",0
588,S1297319X02004591,Hip dislocation revealing hip tuberculosis. A case report," Case report The first symptom in this 18-year-old woman was isolated inflammatory pain in the right hip with no functional impairment. A radiograph was considered normal (figure 1) . She came to our clinic 4 months later. She reported gradual loss in limb length and a decline in general health. The femoral head was felt in the right buttock, denoting posterior dislocation of the hip. The limb length difference was 10 cm. A node 2.5 cm in diameter was found in the right groin. An effusion of moderate abundance was present in the right pleural cavity. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 120 mm/h and the leukocyte count was 27,250/ mm3 with a predominance of lymphocytes. An intradermal tuberculin test produced a blister. Serological tests for the human immunodeficiency virus were negative. The anteroposterior radiograph of the hip showed an empty acetabulum with ascension of the femoral head, locoregional demineralization, and a cyst within the femoral head (figure 2) . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidenced fluid distending the joint cavity by fluid and femoral head ascension with bony lesions (figures 3 and 4) . A small pericardial effusion was detected by echocardiography. A synovial specimen collected under computed tomography guidance, a pleural specimen obtained by fine-needle biopsy, and a specimen taken from the surgically removed groin lymph node showed epithelioid and giant-cell granulomatosis with caseous necrosis. Cultures of the joint fluid grew cauliflower-like colonies from which the tubercle bacillus was isolated. Streptomycin, rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide were given for 2 months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid for 7 months. The organ lesions resolved. However, an attempt to reduce the hip dislocation 7 months into antituberculous therapy was followed by necrosis of the femoral head. ",0
595,S0090301998001013,Atypical forms of spinal tuberculosis: case report and review of the literature," Case report A 30-year-old man was initially evaluated for a 6-month history of pain in the low back and sacrum. While still being investigated, the patient developed paraesthesias in perineum and both legs along with intermittent urinary incontinence and some bowel difficulties. Neurologic examination on admission revealed diminished sensation in the saddle area, patchy hypoaesthesia in the back of legs and soles of feet, and bilaterally absent ankle jerks. Rectal examination revealed a firm palpable mass that replaced the front of the sacrum. Plain radiographs of the lumbosacral spine were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the sacrum showed an area of bone destruction and a large presacral soft tissue mass with extension of the sacral tumor into the spinal canal (Figure 1).  CT myelogram of the lumbosacral spine showed a complete block below S1 caused by an extradural mass filling the sacral canal, as well as extension of the tumor into the pelvic cavity (Figure 2).  Technetium-99 and Gallium-67 bone scanning was undertaken but was found to be unremarkable and nondiagnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine (Figure 3A, B)  showed abnormal signal intensity of the S1–S3 segments with a modest degree of gadolinium enhancement. The ventral and dorsal cortical outline of these sacral segments was eroded and interrupted. Rudimentary discs between S1/S2 and S2/S3 were spared (Figure 3). The presacral soft tissue mass with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images showed some septations and contiguity with the destructive sacral lesion (Figure 3). An enhancing intraspinal component that compressed the dura was consistent with an extradural tumor in the sacral canal (Figure 3). Axial images with gadolinium showed erosive changes and bony destruction of the front of the sacrum. CT-guided needle biopsy was inconclusive and transrectal biopsy of the presacral mass also failed to establish a diagnosis. Based on the CT scan and MRI findings of sacral tumor eroding the bone and extending into the pelvic cavity and spinal canal and in accordance with the radiologist’s report, a provisional diagnosis of chordoma or chondrosarcoma was made. While the therapeutic options of surgical resection and irradiation were being discussed, the patient developed upper cervical pain and spastic tetraparesis. Plain X-rays of the cervical spine were normal. Cervical myelogram revealed a complete block caused by an extradural mass that extended from C2 to C4 on the left side (Figure 4).  CT scan following myelogram showed compression and displacement of the cord by an extradural tumor occupying the left half of the spinal canal (Figure 5).   An emergency upper cervical laminectomy revealed erosion of the left side of the lamina and adjacent transverse process of C3 and a solid tumor-like extradural mass occupying the left half of the spinal canal from C2 to C4. The spinal cord was compressed and pushed to the right. This “tumor” was debulked piecemeal. Histopathology showed tubercular granuloma. AFB were found in and cultured from the biopsy specimen. Antitubercular chemotherapy was started postoperatively. Follow-up 6 months later showed complete resolution of symptoms and neurological deficits. CT scan of the sacrum was also normal. ",0
622,S2405579416300171,Intraocular manifestations of mycobacterium tuberculosis: A review of the literature," Conclusion Intraocular TB is a difficult diagnosis, as it can mimic many other more common etiologies of intraocular inflammation or uveitis. A high index of suspicion for TB and cooperation with infectious disease specialists are paramount, because timely diagnosis and treatment may prevent irreversible vision loss [96]. ",0
636,S1047279716303751,"Individual- and neighborhood-level contextual factors are associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission: genotypic clustering of cases in Michigan, 2004–2012"," Methods  Study population and data collection Our study subsample included only those cases with complete genotype data, both spacer oligonucleotide (spoligotype) and 12-locus-mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat typing (MIRU-VNTR) results, and address information. The genotyping data are part of the CDC-based National Tuberculosis Genotyping Service [18]. Cases were excluded if they had incomplete genotyping data and/or were missing address information. The state of Michigan employs universal genotyping such that greater than 90% of TB cases reported to the state of Michigan were genotyped. At the state level, genotyping was done on the first isolate of a given episode. Isolates from subsequent episodes that were at least 12 months apart were subjected to the same criteria for determining genotypic clusters as described in the following. Demographic characteristics, risk factor information, and clinical characteristics of each case, as well as residential address, were drawn from TB surveillance data collected by MDHHS using the “Report of a Verified Case of TB” form developed by the CDC [14]. Thus, the variables included were defined on the basis of the CDC classifications. Addresses were geocoded and linked with block group–level characteristics derived from the American Community Survey, 5-year estimates for 2012 [19]. The unit of analysis for neighborhood effects was the block group, which serves as a useful proxy for both household-level features such as degradation and vacancy, as well as access to neighborhood resources, both of which are dimensions likely to affect TB transmission. In addition to neighborhood population density and age composition, neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage was captured using a mean index of six census indicators at the block group level: percent black, percent with less than a high school education, percent unemployed, percent using public assistance, percent of vacant properties, and percent with an income-to-poverty level ratio below 2 (The U.S. Census defines an income-to-poverty ratio below 2 as being “poor or struggling.” Thus, we used 2.0 as our cut point to determine the proportion of the block group with an income-to-poverty ratio below 2.0; factor loadings ranged from 0.55 to 0.83, alpha reliability = 0.82). We also sought to examine county-level differences in urban and rural status; however, 94% of cases were identified in a metropolitan region, and thus, we did not include county-level urban/rural status in our investigations.   Genotypic cluster definition Following previously established methods, genotypically clustered cases were considered a proxy for recently transmitted infections, as defined by those sharing an identical spoligotype and 12-locus-MIRU-VNTR result with at least one other case in the sample, and having a count date within 1 year of one another [5,20]. We used the count date as a proxy for date of diagnosis. Unique (“nonclustered”) cases were those that either did not share an identical spoligotype and 12-locus-MIRU-VNTR result or did not have a count date within the 1-year time period and were considered a proxy for reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI). Genotypic clusters could span more than 1 year if the cluster involved two cases with identical genotypes that had at least one other matching case within a 1-year time frame. Genotypically clustered cases defined as such do not necessarily occur in spatial clusters.   Statistical analysis We analyzed individual- and neighborhood-level predictors of recent transmission in relation to variables of four types: demographic factors, known TB risk factors (as defined by the CDC [14]), clinical factors, and neighborhood characteristics at the block group level. Demographic factors included nativity, race/ethnicity, age, and gender. Known TB risk factors included HIV status, alcohol use, diabetes, injecting drug use, noninjecting drug use, long-term care facility stay, and homelessness. Clinical risk factors included immunosuppression, sputum-smear status, sputum-culture status, site of TB disease, and initial chest radiography results. Block-group characteristics included population density, proportion of the population over 64 years of age, and the neighborhood disadvantage index, all of which were modeled in quartiles. See Appendix A for details on how each variable was measured. Univariate, modified Poisson regression models were used to examine the influence of each risk factor individually on recent transmission. For data reduction, we then used stepwise regression to determine which variables, when considered together, were the most significant predictors of recent transmission. Finally, we constructed a final set of multivariable modified Poisson models that included the variables determined to be significant based on the stepwise regression model as well as a priori knowledge. Modified multivariate Poisson regression models were estimated using generalized estimating equations to account for nesting of cases within block groups [21]. Such models allow for accurate parameter estimation and robust variance estimates by accounting for the correlated observations existing among cases in the same block group. The prevalence ratio of recent transmission and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a Poisson regression model with a log-link function. Because previous research has suggested that the factors influencing transmission are different for U.S.-born and foreign-born populations [9,15,22], models were stratified by nativity, and results for U.S.-born and foreign-born persons are reported separately. For final analyses, a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For the stepwise regression, we used alpha = 0.2 to select variables for inclusion in the model, and alpha = 0.05 for retention in the final stepwise regression model. Analyses were undertaken using SAS (version 9.4), Cary, NC. This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board for Social and Behavioral Sciences and by the MDHHS Institutional Review Board.  ",0
638,S1201971208000052,Paraplegia due to non-osseous spinal tuberculosis: report of three cases and review of the literature," Case 1 A 20-year-old man was admitted with a 10-day history of back pain and vomiting, followed by marked weakness of the lower limbs and confusion during the three days prior to admission. On admission he was febrile (38°C) and confused. Physical examination was normal except for the neurological signs of stiff neck, bilateral positive Babinski sign, and urinary retention. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed no abnormalities of the cerebral parenchyma except for a low degree of hydrocephalus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed xanthochromic fluid that contained 59 cells/ml, 60% lymphocytes, protein 6.5g/l, glucose 40mg/dl (blood glucose 94mg/dl), and chloride 590mg/dl. Acid-fast stains were negative, as well as India ink and Gram stains. Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures were later positive. Other investigations were normal. HIV serology was negative and the chest X-ray was normal. There was no evidence of active or inactive extrameningeal TB. Anti-tuberculous therapy consisting of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RMP), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) in addition to IV dexamethasone 24mg/day were initiated on the second hospital day. By the fourth hospital day, the patient had paraplegia, which was associated with asymmetric sensory loss to pinprick at the level of D9 on the right and D4 on the left, and loss of sphincter control. Deep tendon reflexes were absent and bilateral Babinski sign was found. A presumptive diagnosis of meningomyelitis was entertained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed an obliterated subarachnoidal space in the thoracic and lumbar segments, a subarachnoid block with enhancement of nerve roots, and thickening of the ‘filum terminale’. There was gadolinium (Gd) enhancement of the lumbar meninges, suggesting extensive arachnoiditis, and a hypersignal T2 of the spinal cord from the fourth to ninth thoracic vertebra. IV dexamethasone was continued for two weeks, followed by oral prednisone 1mg/kg body weight daily. Twenty-four weeks from the onset, the CSF protein level remained markedly elevated, with a peak of 59.8g/l at 8 weeks. However, by 48 weeks the CSF protein was 0.8g/l. The patient was given four doses of intrathecal methylprednisolone, 40mg, at 10-day intervals starting at week eight. Prednisone was tapered over eight weeks and the patient was maintained on anti-tuberculous therapy for a total of 18 months. At that time, the patient had paraparesis, right hemihypoesthesia below D9, and imperative micturition, but could walk when supported. ",0
640,S2221169116306062,Tuberculosis in the mines of Zambia: A case for intervention," 2 TB among miners in Zambia  2.1 Full text publications Publications specifically focusing on TB among Zambian miners proved to be scarce. Only two online publications were identified based on the study aims. One was a cross-sectional study and the other was a retrospective study. The retrospective study conducted by Mulenga and colleagues examined the cases of silicosis and TB before (1960–1970) and after (1992–2002) the arrival of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. They found that out of 2114 cases of silicosis and TB from 1945 to 2002, 22.7% were silicosis, 65.4% were TB and 11.9% were silicotuberculosis [14]. They also found that during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, silicosis cases decreased from 28.6% to 12.4% and silicotuberculosis increased from 37.1% to 86.1% while TB increased from 37.1% to 86.1%. The authors concluded that although silicosis was an occupational health issue for miners in Zambia, TB was the most significant problem. Exposure to respirable silica dust which can be generated in underground mines has been associated with TB. The risk of TB is even higher among patients who are affected with silicosis, another silica-related disease [15]. Silica-related TB is a serious condition since the risk of TB is life-long even after exposure ceases [16]. A cross-sectional study was conducted by Hayumbu et al. in the copper mines of Mufulira and Nkana to measure silica exposure [17]. This was part of an epidemiological study to determine the risk of respiratory diseases (silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and TB) among Zambia miners. Their results showed that 76% of the samples collected at Mufulira mines were above the limit of quantification and had a mean respirable dust concentration of 0.992 mg/m3 while Nkana mines had 69% of samples above limit of quantification and a mean respirable dust concentration of 0.868 mg/m3. Although these concentrations were below the Zambian legal limit of 1.75 mg/m3, it was higher than the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration's recommendation of 0.5 mg/m3. In addition, their findings showed that Mufulira mines and Nkana mines had mean respirable quartz, a form of crystalline silica, of 0.143 mg/m3 and 0.060 mg/m3, respectively, which were higher than the mean respirable quartz of another study in South Africa whereby the prevalence of silicosis among the gold miners was 18.3%–19.9%. They concluded that weak dust monitoring may increase the risk of nonmalignant diseases including TB among the miners. They recommended collaboration between mining companies and the Zambian government in establishing a national laboratory to provide data to develop effective dust control strategies.   2.2 Reports and grey literature According to the Occupational Health and Safety Institute, the regulatory body established under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 2010, of Zambia [18], the weighted average of the incidence rate of PTB among current mines 1994–2014 was 658 per 100000 populations. Figure 1  shows descriptive data of a sample of the incidence rate of PTB among current copper miners. The incidence rate increased from 1994 to 2005 but since 2005, it has steadily decreased. In 2014, the incidence rate of PTB among miners in Zambia was 288 per 100000 populations. The TB notification rate as reported by the Zambian Ministry of Health through the National TB Control Program may be used as an indicator to determine the magnitude of the burden of TB in a specific location. The two main provinces where the mines are concentrated had the highest TB notification rates. The Copperbelt Province which holds the most copper mines in the region had a notification rate of 415 per 100000 people in 2013 which was more than 10-fold the national TB notification rate [19]. The national prevalence survey also showed the Copperbelt Province to have the highest prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB of 1211 per 100000 people in the general population [1].  ",0
641,S1383576911002029,Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia misdiagnosed as miliary tuberculosis: A case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 32-year-old man, shopkeeper by occupation with a history of smoking presented with a six-week history of low-grade fever, dry cough with exacerbation at night and dyspnoea at rest. He denied any history of chest pain, hemoptysis, night sweats but mentioned about decreased appetite and weight loss. He consulted with general practioner and was told to have pulmonary tuberculosis on the basis of chest symptoms and micro-nodular opacity seen over chest radiograph. He was advised antitubercular treatment, which he took for three weeks. Having no clinical or radiological improvement he stopped all medications and reported at our institute. The past medical history was unremarkable. On clinical examination he was febrile; pulse rate was 110/min and respiratory rate 28/min. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral basilar polyphonic wheezes and crackles along with normal breath sounds. Abdominal examination revealed mild nontender hepatomegaly and just palpable spleen. No clinically palpable peripheral lymphnodes were detected. Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin of 14.5g/dL and total blood leukocyte count of 29,700/mm3. DLC revealed eosinophils 60% and absolute eosinophils count was 17,500/mm3. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated (60mm/1st hour). Other biochemical parameters like blood sugar, blood urea and serum creatinine were within normal limit. However, liver function test showed mildly raised bilirubin (2.8mg/dL) and elevated alkaline phosphatase level (707IU/L). Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was also significantly elevated (1227U/L). The sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli though it contained predominantly eosinophils. Tuberculin test was negative. Chest radiograph showed micro-nodular infiltrates (miliary shadow) with almost uniform distribution in both lung fields and involving middle and lower zones (Fig. 1A). High resolution CT scan of chest showed a fine micronodular pattern in both lung field and radiologists were in favour of eosinophilic lung condition (Fig. 1B). Bronchoscopy was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid demonstrated more than 25% eosinophils. The BAL fluid culture findings (for bacteria, fungus, and acid-fast bacilli) and cytology for malignant cells were negative. Patient underwent a bone marrow aspiration study to rule out any primary eosinophilic process. It revealed increased eosinophilic myelopoiesis. Pulmonary function showed mixed obstructive and restrictive ventilatory impairment. Serum total IgE level was >2500IU/ mL (reference range <100IU/mL). Results of stool examination were negative for ova and parasites. We proceed to filarial serological test and serum filarial antibody (IgG) was positive in high titer (1:1024). There was absence of microfilariae in both day and night blood samples. Result of Strongyloides serological test was negative. The patient was diagnosed to have tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Treatment was initially started with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) (6mg/kg per day) in divided doses and prednisolone at a dose of 0.75mg/kg body weight. Combined DEC and prednisolone therapy continued for three weeks. A slow tapering started after 3weeks and we discontinued steroid by next three months. Within three days after starting combination therapy, patient noted a dramatic improvement in his symptoms, with marked radiographic resolution by the end of treatment. The eosinophil count decreased to 1500 eosinophils/mm3 at the completion of therapy. The serum LDH level and liver function parameters recovered gradually to the near normal range. Improvement was also evident in chest skiagram (Fig. 2B) and pulmonary functions. At the six-month follow-up visit, patient continued to be asymptomatic, and his absolute eosinophil count became normal with a near normal chest skiagram (Fig. 2C). ",0
643,S0377123717305683,GASTRIC TUBERCULOSIS: A Case Report," Discussion The ileo-cecal region is the most common site of involvement of gastrointestinal tuberculosis. GTB is a rare clinical entity. Good reported an incidence of 0.03% in routine autopsies and 0.3% in the autopsies of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [2]. The relative sparing of the stomach has been explained by the paucity of lymphoid tissue, low gastric pH and the rapid emptying of gastric contents [3]. GTB usually develops secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. In a review of literature, Broders found evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in 34 out of 49 cases of GTB [4]. Besides direct mucosal invasion of swallowed bacilli, the other routes of infection include retrograde spread from celiac lymphnodes, haemato-genous spread, direct extension or super – infection of a pre-existent gastric ulcer. There are very few reports of primary gastric tuberculosis i.e., without evidence of tuberculosis elsewhere [5,6]. The gastric antrum and the pre-pyloric area are the most common sites of involvement. Ulcerative lesions are by far the most common (80%) followed by hypertrophic which present with linitus plastica. Other pathological types include ulcerative-hypertrophic, erosive gastritis and nodular. The clinical manifestations of GTB are varied. The patient may present with dyspeptic symptoms, gastric outlet obstruction, prolonged pyrexia or upper GI bleeding in various combinations. The diagnosis of GTB can be confirmed by demonstrating caseating granulomas and/or acid fast bacilli in the mucosa and sub-mucosa of the stomach. Conventional endoscopic biopsies may not provide adequate tissue for diagnosis, especially in the hypertrophic and nodular varieties of GTB. Endoscopic fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) may be a better option as it can reach deeper tissues and is an effective modality in the diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis. GI tuberculosis responds well to chemotherapy. Although six months duration of therapy has been shown to be effective for GI tuberculosis, the duration of therapy is best individualised and guided by the response to treatment [7]. Surgery is usually required if gastric outlet obstruction is present. ",0
645,S1472979211001788,Co-morbidities associated with tuberculosis in an autopsy case series," 2 Study design and methods This study is a retrospective review of MTB cases examined by the UTMB Autopsy Service between the years 2000 and 2010. The purpose of this case series was to review the observations and anatomical diagnoses made at autopsy, confirm the diagnosis and extent of MTB infection, and to identify and confirm any co-morbid conditions. Reports containing the terms ‘tuberculosis’, ‘MTB’, ‘TB’ and ‘mycobacterium’ were retrieved using the Systematic Nomenclature of MEDicine (SNOMED) system. Autopsy reports and histologic slides were reviewed to determine the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, HCV, HBV, and other co-morbidities, and to exclude other mycobacteria-related diseases. Also determined was whether tuberculosis or the pre-existing disease(s) was the immediate or underlying cause of death, contributory, or an incidental finding. Statistical analysis to calculate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was conducted using the SPSS software, v.17.0. ",0
650,S0008874914000550,"Analysis of Th1, Th17 and regulatory T cells in tuberculosis case contacts"," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Individuals and IGRA tests Nineteen TB case contacts detected by the Health Department of Zacatecas, Zac., México, from 2008 to 2010 were included in the study. Fourteen were females and five were males, with a mean of age 41.0years. A TB case contact was defined as a household contact with the TB patient by at least three times per week, 6h each time. The time of exposition with the TB case was 10.16±17.06months. All case contacts were apparently healthy, with no clinical manifestations of TB. In order to determinate the absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the criteria for the diagnosis of this condition of the American Diabetes Association were employed, including the presence of polyuria, polydipsia or polyphagia, and random plasma glucose levels (?11.1mmol/l) [24]. Additional demographic and clinical data of patients included in the study are shown in Table 1 . Quantiferon-TB-Gold I-Tube test (QFT) (Cellestis Limited, Chadstone, Vic., Australia) was carried out in all cases, and at three different times (0, 12, and 18months). A value >0.35IU/mL was considered as positive. According to the results of the three IGRA tests performed, case contacts were classified into two groups: persistently positive or persistently negative. An additional blood sample was obtained at month 18 from all these case contacts to perform the cell cultures and flow cytometry analyzes described below. Furthermore, in all cases a candidin skin test was performed at month 18, and a value ?5mm of induration was considered positive. This test was used to assess the immunological cellular competence of case contacts, and those individuals with a negative result were excluded of this study.   2.2 Cell cultures Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), analyzed for viability (always >95%), and resuspended at a density of 1×106 cells/mL in complete RPMI 1640 culture medium (Hyclone, Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO BRL, Rockville, MD, USA), 2mM l-glutamine, 50U/mL penicillin, and 50?g/mL streptomycin (Sigma). PBMCs (1×106) were placed in 48-well plates and incubated with mouse anti-human CD3 and CD28 (10?g/mL) (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) plus a rabbit anti-mouse IgG (4?g/mL) (AbDseroTec, Killington, UK) as a cross-linker. Moreover, 1ml of heparinized whole blood was cultured for 24h at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity in the presence of a peptide cocktail containing the ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB7.7 (p4) antigens from M. tuberculosis (Quantiferon-TB-Gold IT kit). Brefeldin (1?g/mL, Sigma) was added 3h before the end of the incubation period. Finally, PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and analyzed by flow cytometry [25,26].   2.3 Flow cytometry analysis Stimulated PBMCs were incubated with an anti-human CD4-FITC mAb, followed by fixation and permeabilization (4% p-formaldehyde and 0.01% saponin) and addition of an anti-human-CTLA-4-PE, anti-human Foxp3-PE (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), anti-human IL-17-PE, or anti-human IFN-?-PE (eBioscience) for 20min at 4°C. Then cells were washed and fixed with 1% PFA, and analyzed in a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). Results were expressed as the percentage of positive cells.   2.4 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed by using the InStat Graph Pad software (InStat Graph Pad Inc., v. 3.0. San Diego, CA, USA). Differences between groups were determined via parametric and non-parametric analysis using the un-paired T test and Mann Whitney U test. The association between cell numbers and IFN-? release levels was determined by using the Spearman’s correlation analysis.  ",0
653,S2444340917000516,A case-series analysis of tuberculosis in pediatric patients treated in a tertiary level hospital," 2 Methods This study carried out at a third level of attention medical unit that receives patients referred from the states of Morelos, Guerrero, Chiapas, Querétaro and the south region of Mexico City. A retrospective cohort from January 2010 to December 2013 was followed. The study was descriptive and observational. We included consecutive cases from newborns to adolescents aged sixteen years 11 months who had the diagnosis of “disease by M. tuberculosis” according to the definitions from the NOM-006-SSA-2013 and whose clinical file information was complete. We created a database with demographic, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic information. No informed consent letter was issued. We performed a descriptive statistical analysis with frequency measures for qualitative variables and mean or median (according to its distribution) for quantitative variables. We used SPSS® Statistics 20 software for the analysis. The project was approved by the local Committee for Health Research 3603 of the Hospital de Pediatría, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Mexico City, with the number R-2012-3603-12. ",0
680,S0379073810003567,Progressive primary pulmonary tuberculosis presenting as the sudden unexpected death in infancy: A case report," 2 Case report A 4.5-month-old male infant was found dead in bed by his mother. The mother was a 22-year-old G2P2A0 whose first pregnancy was complicated by mild pre-eclampsia but the antenatal course of this pregnancy was uneventful. The mother did not smoke or drink and sought prenatal care at 12 weeks gestation when routine prenatal tests, including those for syphilis and HIV, were negative. Ultrasonography performed at 22 weeks established a gestational age and excluded major congenital abnormalities. Fetal growth as assessed by symphysis pubis-fundus measurements was normal as were the umbilical artery flow velocity waveform and non-stress tests at 29 and 35 gestational weeks. The infant was born at 38 gestational weeks by uncomplicated vaginal delivery, weighing 3440 grams with Apgar scores of 9, 10 and 10 at 1, 5 and 10min, respectively. At birth the hemoglobin of the newborn was 17g/dL and the glucose 49mg/dL (2.7mmol/L). The infant stayed with the mother after delivery and both were discharged from hospital 1-day post-delivery. Neonatal course and well-baby checks were unremarkable; immunizations were up-to-date, including BCG given before discharge from hospital. At the 2-month follow-up visit, the infant's weight was between the 3rd and 50th centiles for the local population. For the 2 weeks prior to his death, the infant had mild upper respiratory symptoms with suspected (but not proven) fever, which improved symptomatically upon treatment with home remedies; the mother regarded the illness as trivial and did not think it necessary to attend the nearby hospital. The day of his demise, the infant was “crying and fussy” in the early morning hours but eventually fell asleep. He was found deceased 5h later in a prone position with his head turned to the side. The case was referred for forensic autopsy and the parents gave permission for additional tissue procurement for research in the Safe Passage Study. A death scene investigation was performed within 14 days of death by the authors according to the SUDI/SIDS protocols of the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA [1]. At the time of death, the infant was bed sharing with his parents and two other children in a double bed, typical of the family sleeping arrangements. The bedding was firm with no pillows or heavy blankets. There was no evidence or history of wedging, asphyxial positioning or overlay by any of the bed occupants. Pediatric autopsy was performed on a male infant, length 65.5cm (60–66cm), weighing 6.0kg (5.8–7.8kg). The surface of the liver demonstrated numerous white nodules, 1mm or less (Fig. 1A) which microscopically showed non-caseating granulomas (Fig. 1B). A 2.5cm caseating mass with cavitation was present in the upper lobe of the right lung, with large, matted hilar and tracheobronchial nodes which appeared to partially occlude the airway (Fig. 2 ). Histology of the lung and nodes confirmed granulomatous inflammation with amorphous necrosis and giant cells (Fig. 2); Ziehl–Neelsen stains were positive for acid fast bacilli consistent with TB. The parotid gland showed evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (Fig. 3 ) but there was no evidence of systemic CMV infection. The examination of the brain and spinal cord was negative for TB meningitis. The death scene, historical, and autopsy findings were reviewed by all authors and a consensus diagnosis reached of progressive primary pulmonary tuberculosis with caseation and cavitation, complicated by intrathoracicadenopathy, compression of the airway, and miliary spread to the liver. Testing for HIV was negative. Investigation of family and contacts excluded TB in the father and mother but identified TB in a cousin, a close contact of the deceased infant. ",0
681,S2213398416300410,Mutations in katG and inhA genes of isoniazid-resistant and -sensitive clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and their association with minimum inhibitory concentration of isoniazid," 2 Materials and methods Totally, 50 INH-resistant and 20 INH-sensitive M. tuberculosis isolates from previously treated cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were consecutively enrolled from TB laboratory, King George's Medical University, Lucknow. The resistance pattern of first-line anti-tubercular drugs, 12  including streptomycin (S), isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) and ethambutol (E), were recorded. Laboratory quality control for drug susceptibility testing (DST) against SM, INH, RIF and EMB is provided by the National JALMA Institute of Leprosy & Other Mycobacterial Diseases, Agra (India).  2.1 Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing All isolates were tested for INH-MIC by absolute concentration method on Lowenstein–Jensen (LJ) slants from 0.1?g/ml to 16?g/ml (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16?g/ml). 13  The standard strain of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was tested as control (sensitive at <0.1?g/ml). Resistance to INH was defined as MIC of ?0.2?g/ml.   2.2 DNA extraction A rapid DNA extraction procedure was performed for M. tuberculosis colonies on Lowenstein–Jensen slants. A loopful of fresh organism colonies were suspended in 200?l sterile distilled water, vortexed for 1min and lysed by boiling for 15min at 95°C. Then, 200?l of chloroform was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 12000× g for 10min and supernatant was used as a DNA template for amplification. 14     2.3 Amplification of katG and inhA genes A segment of 435bp katG gene was amplified with a set of primer F-GCAGATGGGGCTGATCTACG and R-AACGGGTCCGGGATGGTG in a single fragment. 15  The entire inhA gene was amplified with two overlapping fragments by two sets of primers: 700bp by using F-CTACATCGACACCGATATGAC and R- GACCGTCATCCAGTTGTAG primers and 677bp by F-GCATCAACCCGTTCTTCGAC and R-TAATGCCATTGATCGGTGATAC primers. 9  PCR amplification for both the genes (katG and inhA) was conducted in a total volume of 20?l reaction mixture with the following reagents: 5?l of genomic DNA, 2.5?l 10× buffer, 10mM dNTPs and 1.0U Taq polymerase and final concentrations of 20pmol of each set of primers. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation of 95°C for 3min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 45s, annealing at 64°C for 45s (katG) and 55°C for 45s, extension of 72°C for 1min and final extension of 72°C for 5min (for both fragments of inhA). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel under ultraviolet light.   2.4 Sequencing of katG and inhA genes PCR products of the KatG and inhA genes were purified using exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The purified PCR products were sequenced by using forward and reverse primers on an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) using Big Dye Terminator chemistry (version 3.1). 16  Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the amplified products were analyzed by using BLAST with reference strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv.   2.5 Analysis of sequencing data The obtained sequencing data were analyzed by sequencing analysis software v5.2 (Applied Biosystems, CA, 94404, USA) and freely available web-based software NCBI BLAST (assessable at: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The sequencing data of mutations have been deposited in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under Genbank accession number KC844268 to KC844289, KC800647 to KC800661 and KF704009 to KF704041 for katG gene, KJ652027 to KJ652085 and KJ545536 for inhA gene.

682,S2213007116301253,Pulmonary tuberculosis followed by sarcoidosis in an HIV-infected patient: A case report and a simplified diagnostic flowchart for diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis," 2 Case presentation CF, a 26-years-old man of North African origin, was hospitalized for persistent cough on July 2003. Chest x-ray showed at this moment bilateral hilar adenopathy and tenuous infiltration of the upper right lobe. HRTC showed multiple irregular parenchymal opacities of alveolar interstitial type at the upper lobes and bilateral hilar enlargement. Diagnosis of pulmonary TB was made after bronchoscopy on July 2003, for positivity of M. tuberculosis DNA and RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Culture of sputum and BAL fluid were negative. Tuberculin skin test was negative. Anti TB therapy was started on July and continued for six months until January 2004. HIV infection had been diagnosed just one month before this hospitalization, on June 2003, with a CD4+ count of 371/mmc (19.6%), HIVRNA 139,000 cp/ml (wild type) and HCV coinfection (HCV type 1a). Antiretroviral therapy with (azt + 3tc) + nvp was also started on June 2003. During the first year he attained a good viro-immunological response, but later he became less compliant, and on November 2004 he was lost to follow up. On April 2006 he was readmitted at day service during a period of jail detention: CD4+ were 374/mmc (26%), HIV viremia was 3055 cp/ml and HCV RNA titre was 3,097,802 cp/ml. ART therapy was switched to tdf + 3tc + lpv/r. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary apical bilateral infiltrates without pleural effusion, but the patient was lost to follow up for a second time before doing further investigations. After two years, on March 2008, he was conducted to the service for consultation: he was in good conditions, but since 2007 he was developing chronic cutaneous maculopapular lesions at the right arm. Adherence to ART therapy was suboptimal and he was highly viremic, with 166,469 cp/ml of HIVRNA on July 2008. Therapy was modified to (tdf + ftc) + lpv/r. During the following year he developed multiple symmetric lymphadenopathies (neck, axillae and groin). Chest x-ray showed: bilateral fibronodular apical-subclavian lesions with hilar enlargement and prominence of the left second cardiac arch. CT-scan revealed mediastinal and intra-abdominal periaortic severe adenopathy (4 cm diameter). Biopsy of the forearm cutaneous lesions showed granulomatous infiltration of sarcoid type without caseous necrosis. BAAR or fungi were not detected by specific stains of the tissue. He was hospitalized in another institution for dyspeptic symptoms on October 2009. Total body CT-scan showed enlarged intra-abdominal lymph nodes (max 2.5 cm in diameter), hilar bilateral adenopathy (3 cm in diam.) and apical pulmonary fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrates of lymphatic origin (galaxy sign). Biopsy of an axillary lymph node showed foci of chronic granulomatous epithelioid inflammation with giant multinucleated cells. No mycobacteria spp, fungi or other parasites were demonstrated by molecular or histological techniques. Bronchoscopy was also performed with BAL and the research of malignant cells and mycobacteria spp was negative (MTB and atypical mycobacteria) by PCR and culture. He was dismissed on November 2009 with the diagnosis of: “Chronic granulomatous lymphadenitis, Chronic Active Hepatitis HCV-related, Duodenitis in patient with HIV infection C3, Opioid addiction undergoing pharmacological therapy”. Afterwards he continued ART therapy with better adherence, but after few months he presented general malaise, weight loss, persistent nausea and anorexia with emesis, increasing groin adenopathy and was newly hospitalized for the clinical suspect of lymphoma. Node biopsy showed: “Chronic granulomatous non necrotising epithelioid gigantocellular lymphadenitis with confluent foci as observed in sarcoidosis”. PCR for M. tuberculosis DNA and for atypical mycobacteria from node sections was negative. Culture for M tuberculosis and other mycobacteria was also negative. IGRA test (Quantiferon-TB test) was negative. Functional respiratory tests were also performed: Walking test was normal, Spirometry showed moderate-severe obstructive disease, with reduction of CO diffusion. Salivary glands echography showed parenchymal disomogeneity with ectasic ducta. Eye examination was normal. Steroid therapy was started on July 2010 with prednisone at the dose of 1 mg/kg/die: after one month lymph nodes were considerably reduced; the patient was gaining weight; he had neither fever nor constitutional symptoms. He continued ART therapy with (azt + 3tc) + lpv/r. Corticosteroid therapy was continued for 6 months (including one month of voluntary auto-suspension), but on March 2011 AST/ALT values were increased (446/315 mU/ml). Liver biopsy was decided, but the patient was definitely lost to follow up for personal reasons. ",0
692,S105488071200018X,Case report of left atrial appendageal tuberculosis," 1 Case report A 48-year-old housewife had been symptomatic for the past 6 years. At the onset, she had left-sided chest pain on exertion, which was relieved by rest. For the last 2 years, she had progressive shortness of breath (Grades III–IV), palpitation, and chest pain. Chest radiograph had shown marked cardiomegaly. A work-up with two-dimensional echocardiography revealed a dilated left atrium (5.6 cm), severe mitral regurgitation, moderate mitral stenosis (mitral valve area of 1.2 cm2), mild aortic regurgitation, and stenosis with moderate pulmonary hypertension (54 mmHg) and left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. With a clinical diagnosis of rheumatic mixed valvular disease, mitral valve replacement with biatrial maze procedure was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. The native mitral valve and LAA (Fig. 1 ) were sent for histologic examination. The valve, received in two pieces, showed moderately thickened calcified leaflets, markedly fused commissures, and marked shortened, thickened, and fused chordae tendineae. The appendage measured 2×1.5 cm, weighed 3 g, and was covered by thick opacified epicardium. Serial cross sections showed hypertrophy of the myocardium, marked endocardial thickening, and partial luminal occlusion by organizing thrombi. On histology, the appendageal wall in all its layers showed an abundant chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate accompanied by multiple epithelioid cell granulomas, some of which showed central caseous necrosis. Organizing/recanalizing thrombi were present over the endocardium. Results of special stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were negative; polymerase chain reaction result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also negative. Review of the chest radiograph, echocardiography, and operative notes did not reveal any pericardial pathology or myocardial dysfunction. On further questioning, the patient gave a history of low-grade fever off and on with dry cough for the past 7 months. Subsequent high-resolution chest computed tomography was performed and showed pre-tracheal lymphadenopathy and patchy consolidation of both lower lobes, raising the suspicion of tuberculosis. Due to the high incidence of tuberculosis in this part of the world, the patient was discharged on anticoagulant therapy and antituberculous therapy. Clinical and radiological improvement was noted after 8 months of follow-up with disappearance of the opacities and decrease in lymphadenopathy, and so a diagnosis of LAA tuberculosis was made. ",0
694,S1752928X1100031X,HIV-negative drug addict diagnosed with AIDS and tuberculosis at autopsy: A case report and brief review of literature," 2 Case report A 27- year-old Chinese man was taken to the local hospital due to high fever, oral ulcers, diarrhea and persistent cough. Those symptoms occurred repeatedly for the past few months. During the previous admission to the same clinic four months back, HIV testing was warranted because of suspicion that he was an intravenous drug addict, but the relatives denied the addiction and did not give consent. However, during this last admission, a test for HIV antibodies was performed after painstakingly convincing the relatives of its importance. The HIV-test result came out negative, to the relief of both relatives and treating physicians. The medical records mentioned that he had warts, fever, pneumonia, diarrhea, oral ulcers and that he was treated symptomatically. However, during the same night, the patient’s health condition deteriorated, he developed Cheyne-Stokes breathing, became unconscious and died despite resuscitation attempts. The relatives requested a forensic autopsy on the ground of inadequate medical care by the hospital. ",0
697,S1201971207000379,Evidence of ‘amplifier effect’ in pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: report of three cases," Patient histories  Patient 1 A 23-year-old female was diagnosed with TB by smear microscopy (new case) in January 2001 at Gikondo Health Center (Table 1 ). She was HIV-1/2 seronegative, had no family ties with patients 2 and 3, but was hospitalized for 1 month in the same room as patient 2 during the first treatment phase of category II (2(SERHZ)7/1(ERHZ)7/5(ERH)3) (July 2001). She received the World Health Organization (WHO) category I treatment regimen (2(ERHZ)7/4(RH)3) but remained smear positive after 5 months after which the patient was retreated with a category II regimen (Table 2 ). In March 2002, the patient received the same retreatment regimen with the addition of ciprofloxacin.   Patient 2 This female, aged 22 years, was first hospitalized in July 2001 at Gikondo Health Center, in the same room as patient 2, for malaria (Table 1). She was later diagnosed with TB by smear microscopy (new case) in September 2002 at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Kigali (CHUK) and was seronegative for HIV-1/2. She was transferred to Gikondo Health Center where she begun treatment with the category I regimen. However, the patient remained smear positive after 5 months of treatment, and was started on the category II regimen in March 2003; she was hospitalized several times (Table 2). Three months after starting the category II treatment (June 2003), the patient was confirmed to be an MDR case, with the isolate being resistant to isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), ethambutol (E) and rifabutin. She began another retreatment with streptomycin (S), isoniazid, ofloxacin and clofazimine, but this patient remained smear positive in November, and her treatment was consequently changed to second-line drugs (clofazimine, ofloxacin, prothionamide and pyrazinamide). However, the patient died four months later.   Patient 3 Patient 3 was a younger sibling of patient 2. She was 16 years old and seronegative for HIV-1/2 (Table 1). She took care of her sister while in hospital and later accompanied her to receive treatment from a DOT center. In September 2003, she was diagnosed with TB (new case) and begun treatment with the category I (2(ERH)7/4(RH)3) regimen. However, the patient remained smear positive after three months of treatment. The M. tuberculosis isolate cultured from this patient was found to be resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and rifabutin like the one initially cultured from her older sister after the first regimen. In April 2004, she was transferred to France where she is still undergoing treatment with second-line drugs.  ",0

On clinical examination, she was healthy looking person and she was apyrexic (Temp.; 36.2°C). On local examination of her right ankle there was a 3cm×4cm fluctuant, painless swelling at the lateral malleolus. The ankle had full range of movements without any pain. About 2 weeks ago, she sprained her ankle while walking on uneven grounds. There was no history of systemic upset including loss of appetite, swinging pyrexia or rigors. Laboratory findings were all normal except an elevated CRP test [22] at time of presentation. Laboratory tests; WBC: 9.2 (4.0–11.5), CRP: 22 (normal <3). Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the right ankle showed an extensive irregular lytic lesion of the right distal fibula bone, without the involvement of the talus, calcaneus or distal tibia.      MRI of the right ankle showed the oedema within the distal 4.5cm of the fibula associated with periosteal new bone formation and cortical destruction on its lateral and inferomedial aspects. Chest X-ray was abnormal. Abnormal chest X-ray of the patient—Normal heart size. There is widening of the right mediastinal contour, in association with a right pleural effusion. Gram stain and culture (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) were negative. Acid-fast stain was positive for tuberculosis bacterium. Histological examination of the biopsy sample showed granuloma and caseating necrosis. Formal incision and drainage was carried out and the patient responded well to anti-tuberculosis therapy. ",0
724,S2212553116300620,More than half of presumptive multidrug-resistant cases referred to a tuberculosis referral laboratory in the Tigray region of Ethiopia are multidrug resistant," Methods  Study design and setting This was a health facility-based retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in the Tigray Regional Research Laboratory located in Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray region. This regional research laboratory is the only laboratory that provides MDR testing service in the Tigray region and is a referral site for presumptive MDR cases from all parts of Tigray (North Ethiopia).   Study population and sampling technique Relevant data were recorded conveniently for all presumptive MDR cases (treatment failure and relapse cases, defaulters, and a few new cases) referred to the Tigray Regional Research Laboratory for MDR testing between January 2013 and August 2014, using a structured recording format. MDR testing was performed in the regional laboratory by the genotypic method (Genotype MTBDRplus test, Hain Lifescience) following the manufacturer’s instructions and standard operating procedures. Data on the sociodemographic characteristics, INH and RIF resistance outcome, previous history of treatment, and previous treatment subcategories were then extracted from a total of 262 presumptive MDR cases.   Data analysis Data were entered using Epi Data entry version 3.1 (?DenmarkInfo @ EpiData.dk) software and analyzed using SPSS version 21 (?Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Differences between the MDR and non-MDR cases with respect to the patients’ baseline characteristics were assessed using the chi-square test. A p value?.05 was considered statistically significant.   Ethical issues This study was approved by the ethical review committees of the College of Health Sciences, Mekelle University. A letter of cooperation was written to the Tigray Regional Research Laboratory authority. Furthermore, confidentiality of patient information was safeguarded throughout the research activities.  ",0
725,S0399077X17307102,Contribution of brain imaging to the diagnosis of intracranial tuberculoma and other brain lesions in patients presenting with miliary tuberculosis," 2 Materials and methods This study was conducted in a teaching hospital of 954 beds in the north of Paris, France. The infectious disease department accounts for 60 beds. This department, with an ethnically diverse population of patients, treats more than 100 TB patients per year and cares for more than 4000 HIV-infected people. Patients were identified using TB-related keywords on the French hospital discharge database (French acronym PMSI) from 2008 to 2014. Those who had at least one brain imaging performed were selected for the study. Among 154 patients who had TB-related diagnosis with cerebral imaging performed, 34 patients were identified as having a miliary TB pattern upon chest X-ray or CT scan. Miliary TB pattern was characterized by diffuse small interstitial pulmonary nodules of soft tissue density [9]. Other presentations of pulmonary TB were excluded. The following demographic characteristics and underlying conditions were collected: age, place of birth, date of entry in France, previous exposure to TB, date and type of first symptoms, time between symptom onset and diagnosis, and death. Neurological symptoms were reviewed and categorized at the initial evaluation corresponding to the first consultation for miliary TB and during treatment and follow-up. HIV status, antiretroviral therapy (ARV), and CD4 lymphocyte count at diagnosis were collected. Microbiological characteristics, including acid-fast bacilli smear in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or in respiratory samples, culture and susceptibility to antituberculosis drugs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, were collected after validation by the local microbiological laboratory. Brain imaging by computed tomography scan (CT scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture for CSF analysis were performed during the course of the disease without systematic time point for imaging evaluation. Decision to perform a brain imaging or a lumbar puncture was taken by the clinician owing to the local experience. Routine interpretations were made by expert radiologists. Intracranial lesions were classified as tuberculomas, tuberculous abscesses, hyperintensity, pachymeningitis, leptomeningitis, or nodular lesions with positive gadolinium contrast enhancement (Table 1 ). Miliary TB with cerebral involvement was defined as the presence of abnormal brain imaging at baseline and/or during follow-up, irrespective of the presence of neurological symptoms. Twenty-two patients underwent a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid tests at baseline and/or during follow-up, irrespective of the presence of neurological symptoms. The type and duration of antituberculosis (anti-TB) regimens were reported as well as the adjunction of a corticosteroid therapy as soon as daily dosage was ?0.5mg/kg. Clinical and/or radiological worsening during anti-TB treatment despite control of the infection was defined as a paradoxical worsening. Results were expressed as median and range (minimum and maximum). Demographic, clinical, and biological features were compared between intracranial localization groups using a Kruskal–Wallis rank test for continuous variables and either Pearson's test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. All tests were two-sided with a type-I error set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using the R software [10]. Ethical approval was not required for this retrospective study. ",0
727,S1090023316300028,Herd-level risk factors for bovine tuberculosis and adoption of related biosecurity measures in Northern Ireland: A case-control study," Materials and methods  Study area For logistical reasons and in order to decrease variability, a defined study area was chosen in an area of high bTB incidence. This area consisted of parts (area 27/37/39) of two divisional veterinary office (DVO) areas with an annual bTB herd incidence for 2010 of 4.92% in DVO Newry and 7.86% in DVO Newtownards 1   1 See: https://www.dardni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/dard/tb-stats-december2010.pdf (accessed on 22 March 2016).  (Fig. 1 ).   Study population There were 2281 active herds in the study area based on the fact that they were subjected to the single intradermal comparative cervical skin test (SICCT) in 2008 and/or 2009. Inclusion of herds into the study by location was based on point map references of the main farm house since, for practical purposes, this is the best geo-referencing method (Durr and Froggatt, 2002). As the SICCT used to disclose bTB infected animals is not 100% specific (Clegg et al., 2011), case herds were selected on the basis of the presence of confirmed or multiple reactors. The case definition was therefore ‘herds in the study area that, during 2008 and/or 2009, had multiple reactors to the SICCT, or a confirmed bTB breakdown (based on either one or more confirmed reactors to the SICCT, or one or more confirmed animals that were detected at post-mortem examination during routine slaughter)’. Confirmation was based on having positive histopathology or bacteriology findings (O'Hagan et al., 2015). The control selection definition was ‘herds in the study area without restricted herd tests or reactors to the SICCT from 2007 to 2009’. Herd size is a known risk factor in relation to bTB breakdown (Griffin et al., 1996; Olea-Popelka et al., 2004; Green and Cornell, 2005; Abernethy et al., 2010). Background analysis assessing the distribution of active herds in the study area by herd size and case-control status confirmed that large herds were more likely to be cases. Therefore, cases were selected by stratified random sampling based on herd size category (see Appendix: Supplementary Table S1) and DVO area. Small herds (<10 animals) were excluded from the study. Subsequently, controls were selected on a group-matched basis (1:1 match).   Data collection Data were gathered from face-to-face questionnaires and from surveys of badger setts and farm boundaries, with answers referring to the 12 months prior to the bTB breakdown for case farms and the 12 months prior to the survey taking place for control farms (see Appendix: Supplementary Questionnaire). Staff involved in data collection were trained in completing the questionnaires, conducting badger sett surveys, reading farm maps, use of camera/global positioning system (GPS) and recording of field boundaries. The majority of farms were visited by two members of staff to ensure consistency. Two surveys of badger setts were conducted per farm; one survey evaluated the existence of badger activity within the farm boundary and a similar survey assessed the area within a 250?m radius around the farm buildings (see Appendix: Supplementary Badger Survey Form). Badger setts were classified according to Thornton (1998) (see Appendix: Supplementary Table S2). Farm boundaries were defined as any place of contact with a contiguous neighbour; they were described by the participating farmers and boundary surveys were conducted for verification purposes. This resulted in an assessment of the possibility of nose-to-nose contact with cattle from the neighbouring farm, taking into account the farmer's statement on whether cattle were grazed on both sides of the boundary over the 12 month period either prior to the bTB breakdown (cases) or over the 12 months prior to the survey taking place (controls) (risk assessment score 1 to 5; Table 3). If more than one boundary type was present between the study farm and a contiguous farm, they were recorded separately. In November 2010, a pilot study was conducted on eight farms, resulting in minor alterations to the questionnaire. The field study commenced in December 2010 and finished in June 2011.   Data handling and statistical analyses Data were checked and entered on a SQL Server database. Data analyses were conducted using R (2.15.0; The R foundation for Statistical Computing) and SPSS Statistics version 19 (IBM). A comparison between farms that participated and the rest of the study population was conducted by location and herd size in order to assess response bias. There was no significant difference between participating case and control farms in relation to DVO area (?2?=?5.5703; P?=?0.061), but there was a significant difference in relation to herd size (two-sample t test; P?=?0.012). Therefore, a univariable logistic regression model, with herd size added as an a priori confounder, was used to determine whether each variable was significantly associated with case-control status (dependent variable) for progression to multivariable analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted, with variables with P values?<?0.20 in the univariable analysis (based on the likelihood ratio test) being considered for inclusion (Mickey and Greenland, 1989; Katz, 2011). The decision whether to treat independent variables as continuous or categorical was determined by plotting each variable against the dependent variable. Collinearity between variables was assessed using correlation matrices (cut-off point 0.8; Katz, 2011). Final model selection was based on assessment of Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), model fit was assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (P???0.05 indicating significant lack of fit to the data) and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Variables with low numbers in any of the categories (and where it was not possible to combine categories) were excluded (Katz, 2011). Biologically plausible two-way interactions between variables were added to the model and tested for significance (P?<?0.05). A forward stepwise approach was used to build the final multivariable model. This approach is preferred for relatively small data sets containing large numbers of variables (Dohoo et al., 2009; Katz, 2011).  ",0

735,S0968016008000495,Reactivation of ancient joint tuberculosis of the knee following total knee arthroplasty after 61 years: A case report," 2 Case report The patient was a 75-year-old woman. At the age of 14 years she had isolated tuberculosis arthritis of the left knee that was initially treated with a cast. Ten years later a resection arthroplasty and patellectomy, with an interposition of the fascia lata was performed, because of severe pain. Wound healing was by first intention and without complication and she remained free of physical complaints. However, in 1989 the patient visited our clinic with complaints of increasing pain over time, especially during walking and weight-bearing. Physical examination revealed a healthy looking, slim woman with 10–50° of knee motion. Radiographs at that time showed severe knee joint destruction after a resection arthroplasty (Fig. 1A and B). An arthrodesis was suggested but refused by the patient. In 2002 she was seen again with coxarthrosis on the right side. A total hip arthroplasty (THA) was performed without any problems. After this successful procedure, the patient opted for a total knee arthroplasty. In March 2004, a hinged total knee prosthesis was implanted. During this procedure a massive allograft was used because of an Anderson [6] F2B bone defect of the distal femur. No signs of infection were encountered intraoperatively and the patient regained a good range of movement (more than 90 degrees flexion), and the wound healed satisfactorily. Cultures of tissue and fluid showed no growth. Three months later, the patient returned with a painless swelling on the lateral side of her left knee. The scar itself did not show signs of infection. There was no discharge from either the scar or the lateral side and the patient was apyrexial. Laboratory results showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 40; the C-reactive protein level was 19 mg/l and there were no leucocytosis. Radiographs showed no differences from those taken immediately postoperatively (Fig. 2A and B). Additional ultrasound showed signs of a fluid collection on the lateral side. An arthrotomy revealed a small portion of fluid and debris on the lateral side. Samples were taken from the debris and sent for microbiological laboratory analysis. The components were well fixed and after removal of all tissue laterally, the joint was irrigated with a povidine-iodine and saline solution. Gentamicin beads were left intra-articularly and in the lateral gutter for 2 weeks. The postoperative prophylactic antibiotic regimen was 1000 mg of cefazoline three times daily. Fourteen days after surgery, the cultures revealed M. tuberculosis susceptible to all anti-tuberculosis drugs. The patient was then treated with a combination therapy of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. The drug regimen was continued for 9 months postoperatively. During this period, serious side effects, i.e. decreased liver function, arose and so the dosage was adjusted accordingly. At a recent follow-up, the patient was doing well with a good range of movement (flexion/extension 120-0-0) of the left knee and a KSS score of 174 out of 200. The X-rays showed no adverse signs in the left knee. ",0

Symptoms were appeared in a postpartum. Examination of the spine did not show any misalignment, lumbar stiffness was noted, neurological examination found increase of osteotendinous reflexes in the lower limbs and somatic examination was normal. Routine laboratory exams showed high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high C-reactive protein. As part of the infectious assessment, chest radiography showed a miliary appearance confirmed by chest scan (Fig. 1 ) and fusiform paravertebral shadows suggesting abscess formation in the dorsal floor. Computed tomography (Fig. 2 ) of spine confirmed the presence of Pott’s disease. Examination of pus of paravertebral abscess confirmed the presence of Acid-fast bacilli. anti-tuberculosis treatment was expected for 18months with dorso-lumbar spine immobilisation during 4months.

757,S2212553112000891,Unusual presentation of isolated metacarpal tuberculosis," Case presentation A 28-year-old female patient with no medical history presented at an orthopedic outpatient clinic after sustaining an injury to her left hand as a result of falling down some stairs. She had subsequent pain in the hand and difficulty moving it. Upon examination of the injury, a lump was discovered at the base of the fifth metacarpal, with swelling of the dorsal lateral border of the left hand. Wrist movements were normal, but limited by pain. There was warmth of the overlying skin, without rash (Fig. 1 ). An X-ray survey was performed and showed no signs of fracture. Symptomatic treatment was given by her general practitioner. Two months later, the patient had persistent hand pain and a non-healing wound. At the time of admission, the patient presented with a draining sinus from the dorsum of the ulnar border of the left hand, overlying the previous injury area (Fig. 2 ). Paradoxically, she felt generally well. No abnormalities were detected in other bones, and systemic examination was normal with no lymphadenopathy or fever and unremarkable respiratory, cardiovascular and abdominal examination. She had a slightly raised CRP of 12, a normal ESR of 10, and radiographs of the left hand and wrist showed lytic lesions over the base of the fifth metacarpal bone (Fig. 3 ). She reported no contacts with tuberculosis (TB), and on direct questioning had no respiratory symptoms, fevers, night sweats or weight loss, and no other past medical history. The patient had a positive Mantoux test, and her chest X-ray was normal. The overall appearances were suggestive of either osteomyelitis with associated septic arthritis, bony tumor or mycotic lesions. The Ziehl-Neelson test and fungal stains were negative. An open biopsy with curettage confirmed TB. A Lowenstein culture revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Histology of the bone specimen demonstrated multiple granulomas, with ‘a hint of caseation’. Debridement and anti-tuberculosis treatment resulted in complete recovery of the lesion. Thus, the patient was treated with anti-tuberculin medications for 9months and conservative management of the bony lesions with a complete resolution of symptoms. She was started on quadruple anti-tuberculous therapy for 2months, which included: isoniazid (300mg/d), ethambutol (15mg/d), rifampicin (600mg/d) and pyrazinamide (2g/d). She was given prophylactic vitamin B6 (pyridoxine 10mg). Daily therapy with isoniazid and rifampicin was continued for an additional 7months. Within 4months, the patient was pain free, the swelling disappeared and the sinus healed on the affected hand (Fig. 4 ), and X-rays showed no further bony destruction (Fig. 5 ). ",0
777,S1876034113000373,Drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis in new and previously treated cases: Experience from Turkey," Methods The rates of resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E) and streptomycin (S) were analyzed in 387 male patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis who were treated between 1999 and 2004 at the Izmir Training Hospital for Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery. The cases were retrieved from the patient files in the hospital archive and laboratory records and were categorized into three groups: new, re-treated and chronic cases. Sputum and other respiratory secretions (induced sputum, bronchial aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) were examined through smears and culturing for MTB. The duration of basal conversion and the length of stay in the hospital were evaluated. Basal conversion was investigated by examining microscopic smears from the patients on a weekly basis and cultures on monthly basis during hospitalization. After discharge, culture and smear controls were performed on a monthly basis. The case definitions were in accordance with the national TB and WHO guidelines [5,9]. Cases of relapse, treatment failure and treatment after interruption were evaluated in the re-treatment group. Microscopic smears were stained using the Kinyoun method. N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NALC) plus sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was employed for decontamination and homogenization. Lowenstein–Jensen (L–J) Medium and the BACTEC 960 system were used for the isolation of TB bacilli. TB drug susceptibility testing was performed following the critical proportion method and critical concentration method, which is an economic variant of the proportion method conducted on L–J, using a BACTEC 460 semi-automatic system [11,12]. Anti-TB drug susceptibility tests (DSTs) were repeated for each isolate for confirmation of DST results. Between 1999 and 2003, internal quality control was performed using the M. tuberculosis H37 Ra and H37Rv strains for culture and daily DST. The external quality control system has been employed since 2004 by the UK National External Quality Assessment System (NEQAS) for smear and culture confirmation. The EQ for drug susceptibility testing was begun in 2005 through “Lot Quality Assurance Sampling” (LQAS) in a national third-level TB laboratory. Drug regimens were designed for both the new and re-treatment cases following WHO recommendations [9]. The drug resistance classifications were determined according to the WHO guidelines as given below:  Total resistance – any resistance to an anti-TB drug alone and combined with other drugs.   Mono-resistance – resistance to one of the first-line drugs (INH, R, E or S).   Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) – resistance to at least INH and R.   Poly-resistance (other patterns) – resistance to two or more first-line drugs, not including the INH and R combination [5].    The chi-square test in the SPSS program on a personal computer was used for statistical analysis [13]. This study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. ",0
784,S0301211598001122,Genital tuberculosis in a HIV infected woman: a case report," 2 Case report A 24 year old black woman presented with acute abdominal pain on March 1997. She originated from an African country, but she had been in Greece for about one year. Her previous history was unremarkable. The patient reported no weight loss, fatigue, lack of appetite, elevation of temperature or other previous systemic symptoms. The menstrual type was normal, but she complained for vaginal discharge and dyspareunia during the last 2–3 months. Her symptoms had started a few hours earlier and included acute abdominal pain, nausea and fever (38.6°C on admission). Physical examination revealed rebound tenderness and a fixed painful mass on the right of the uterus. On sonographic examination the mass measured 8 cm in diameter, had mixed echogenic and cystic morphology and was located at the right andexae. No peritoneal fluid was observed. The chest X-ray study was negative and the blood cell count revealed Hb 13.7 g/100 ml. Ht 37.7%, white cell count (WCC) 20?100/mm3, 82% neutrocytes, 15% lymphocytes and 5% monocytes. CRP was negative and sedimentation rate was 115 at first hour. The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease and intravenous antibiotic treatment was administered, which included Ampicillin, Clindamycin and Metronidazole. Two days later a laparotomy was decided since there was no improvement of the pain and the WCC had risen to 23?400/mm3. During laparotomy a right tubo–ovarian abscess with adhesions to the intestine and pelvic wall was found and a right salpingooophorectomy was performed with difficulty. No post-operative complication was noticed and the patient improved steadily. Histopathologic examination revealed a granulomatous chronic inflammation, with the positive finding of mycobacteria stained by the Ziehl–Neelsen method, characteristic of tuberculosis [5]. After that, the patient was transferred to the pathology clinic in the same hospital. A new clinical and laboratory investigation followed in order to detect another possible pulmonary or extragenital tuberculosis manifestation. Lung auscultation and abdominal palpation were normal, except for a lower abdominal pain during palpation. The tuberculin test was positive and HIV infection was found by Western Blot hybridization. Computed tomography of thorax and abdomen, as well as IV pyelography did not reveal another extragenital manifestation of tuberculosis and the patient was given treatment both for HIV infection and tuberculosis.

785,S0028384314603212,Central nervous system tuberculosis masquerading as primary dementia: a case report," Case report A 64-year-old woman working in a consulate presented with complaints of forgetfulness, loss of memory and confusion for the past 3 months. She was progressively experiencing difficulty in remembering and recalling important telephone numbers. Soon she was unable to handle the tasks of her daily work, increasingly depending upon her subordinates. She was a non-smoker and had no microvascular or macrovascular risk factors, namely hypertension, diabetes or coronary artery disease. There was no prior history of tuberculosis. Examination revealed an afebrile normotensive woman disoriented to place and time. She was unable to perform simple arithmetic tasks, had constructional apraxia and scored 18/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Right-sided homonymous hemianopia was noted, though there was no papilloedema. Motor examination was normal except for mild incoordination noted on the right finger to nose test. Taking into consideration her age and the predominance of cognitive deficits with paucity of motor and cranial nerve signs on presentation, a presumptive diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia was entertained even though the duration of symptomatology was less than 6 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed ring enhancing solitary lesions in the left frontal lobe and conglomerate ring enhancing masses in the left and right temporo-occipital region with surrounding vasogenic edema (Fig. 1 ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple necrotic lymph nodes in the paratracheal region (Fig. 2 ). Blood tests revealed no evidence of an immunodeficiency state. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was normal. Repeated sputum cultures came back negative for acid fast bacilli. Mantoux tuberculin skin test was positive with induration of 7 mm. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was deferred for fear of precipitating herniation due to mass effect in the brain. Since tuberculosis is endemic in India, the presence of multiple intracranial lesions along with multiple necrotic lymph nodes in the chest was felt to be highly suggestive of disseminated tuberculosis. She was treated with anti-tubercular therapy for one year along with a tapering course of steroids. Brain MRI one year later showed near complete resolution of the ring enhancing lesions with resolution of the surrounding vasogenic edema (Fig. 3 ). The patient was able to return to her work fully functional with no residual memory deficits. ",0

802,S147330991630384X,Effect of new tuberculosis diagnostic technologies on community-based intensified case finding: a multicentre randomised controlled trial," Methods  Study design and participants We did a pragmatic, randomised, parallel-group trial with individual randomisation stratified by country. The study was done in two southern African communities: the Langa informal settlement, in Cape Town, South Africa, and the Mabvuku suburb, in Harare, Zimbabwe. Both have high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence, a high density of informal dwellings, and high unemployment rates. Each day during the week, a research nurse and local community health-care worker travelled to a community location to perform community-based screening in a vehicle. In South Africa, the vehicle was equipped with an awning for shelter, fold-up tables, and capability for rapid HIV testing (Determine HIV-1/2 [Alere] and HIV 1/2 3·0 [Standard Diagnostics, Yongsin, South Korea]), LAM lateral flow, and point-of-care PIMA CD4 cell count testing (Alere). The vehicle also included facilities to securely house and operate a GeneXpert IV machine (Cepheid) and a small portable collapsible tent for privacy during sputum and urine acquisition. For patients unable to spontaneously produce sufficient sputum, facilities for sputum induction with an ultrasonic nebuliser and hypertonic saline using a standard protocol 15  were also available in the tent. In Zimbabwe, a similar set up was used for intensified case finding but eligible participants were driven to the local Mabvuku Community clinic where the same diagnostic tests, including rapid HIV testing and Xpert, were done by a qualified technologist (in keeping with local regulations). A description of each site, and details on the selection of the sites of community sampling, methods used to advertise to the community, and inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the appendix (pp 5–8). The weekly location for the screening was chosen after consulting community leaders, and was systematically clustered around community congregate settings or suspected transmission hot-spots such as shops, hostels, or transit hubs. The vehicle was parked at these locations, and passers-by were encouraged to participate using a loudspeaker, by advertising banners displayed next to the vehicle, and by local advertising at schools, churches, supermarkets, and social clubs. After obtaining informed consent, participants were counselled, and their HIV status confirmed by fingerprick tests using two commercially available assays. The screening protocol depended on HIV status: we consecutively enrolled HIV-positive patients aged 18 years or older with at least one symptom of tuberculosis according to predefined WHO criteria but enrolled all adult HIV-positive patients irrespective of symptoms in line with the WHO recommendation to screen all HIV-positive individuals for tuberculosis. 16,17  Patients who declined HIV testing were screened as though they were HIV-positive. We excluded all patients who had previously self-presented to a tuberculosis community clinic in the past 60 days, had received tuberculosis treatment in the past 60 days, or who were unwilling or unable to give informed consent. This study was approved by the local ethics committees at each site and all patients provided written informed consent.   Randomisation Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo either a novel package of tuberculosis diagnostics (Xpert, urine LAM, and culture) or routine testing (smear microscopy and culture) using computer-generated allocation lists. Once an eligible patient was identified, a nurse masked to these lists contacted a central server in each respective country by text message (in South Africa) or by telephone (in Zimbabwe) to obtain the assignment for each patient (stratified randomisation by country). Central and research laboratory personnel were masked to van-based or clinic-based results using unique participant identifiers that concealed study group assignment.   Procedures In South Africa, the diagnostic tests were done at the point-of-contact at the mobile van using a generator to power the Xpert machine, whereas in Zimbabwe, screened and eligible participants were transported to Mabvuku Clinic and the investigations were done there. We envisioned use of a mobile van for on-site testing at both sites, but the poor road infrastructure and need for regulatory approvals meant this was not feasible in Zimbabwe. At least two spot sputa were obtained sequentially from each participant at recruitment, either spontaneously or by sputum induction as described earlier. One specimen, selected arbitrarily, was sent to a reference laboratory for liquid culture for M tuberculosis using the BACTEC MGIT 960 system (BD, NJ, USA). 18  The other was used for smear microscopy or Xpert, according to allocation. Xpert was done directly on sputum by a health-care worker who had received a 1 day training session at study initiation. Regular unannounced visits by a senior study coordinator assessed the proficiency of health-care workers who did the Xpert tests using a standardised form and surveyed user opinion. In South Africa, specimens for smear microscopy were sent to a reference laboratory, and results were available the following day. In Zimbabwe, smear microscopy was done on the same day at the laboratory clinic. If possible, additional sputum specimens were collected for later analysis. In South Africa, Xpert was done on extra paired sputum specimens in a research laboratory at the end of the study to assess the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of the test in the mobile van. We also collected data for study days lost because of technical problems with the van or the GeneXpert machine. Additionally, HIV-positive patients in the novel diagnostic group were asked to produce at least 15 mL of urine for the LAM lateral flow assay, done at point-of-contact. All cases of tuberculosis diagnosed by point-of-contact tests in the novel diagnostic group were given a referral to their local clinic to commence treatment immediately. Participants in the routine diagnostic group with positive smears, and those in both groups with positive cultures, were contacted by telephone or by home visits, and referred accordingly. All participants in either group with negative initial tests and ongoing tuberculosis symptoms were referred to the local clinic. There, empirical treatment decisions, and the timing thereof, were at the discretion of the attending clinician, and not affected by the study staff. Chest radiography facilities were available at referral centres in both countries, but not at the local clinic. In South Africa, the decision to pursue radiological investigations or non-sputum sampling was at the discretion of the local clinician. In Zimbabwe, the local practice was to refer all patients with negative point-of-contact tests (MTB/RIF, smear microscopy, urine LAM) for a chest X-ray.   Outcomes The primary outcome was the proportion of culture-positive tuberculosis cases initiating tuberculosis treatment in each study group at 60 days. Secondary outcomes were time-to-treatment initiation in each group, the proportion of patients with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis on treatment at 60 days, proportion of participants who completed treatment at 6 months, and measures of feasibility of Xpert in a mobile van.   Statistical analysis The sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF in intensified case finding is unknown. In our sample size calculation, we assumed that the absolute sensitivity of smear and Xpert MTB/RIF would be lower than that previously reported in patients in a South African population 5  because of presumed lower mycobacterial load in ambulatory, less symptomatic patients not seeking diagnostic services, but hypothesised that the approximately 30% relative difference in sensitivity would remain. A previous study involving the use of a mobile van for intensified case finding in Cape Town found that almost all patients diagnosed successfully initiated treatment, and so we did not adjust our presumptive effect size for differences in treatment initiation between groups. Also, in Harare, smear microscopy and Xpert were done at the same clinic, so no difference in time-to-treatment initiation for patients with a positive result for either test was anticipated at that site. With an ? value of 5% (two-sided) and a desired power of 80%, we calculated that we required approximately 80 culture-positive patients to show a significant difference between groups. Assuming the tuberculosis prevalence in screened participants at our study sites to be roughly 3% (a meta-analysis of intensified case finding in HIV-positive patients found a prevalence of tuberculosis of 0·7% and 8·5% in the general population and in HIV clinics, respectively), 19  we aimed to screen approximately 2600 participants. We powered the study for the primary outcome. Sputum culture positivity for M tuberculosis complex was the reference standard. We used the ?2 test for comparisons between proportions at 60 days and other timepoints. We did a sensitivity analysis to compare the per-protocol approach and the modified intention-to-treat approach for the binary outcome of treatment initiation by 60 days. A post-hoc false discovery rate controlling procedure (Simes method) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. 20  The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare time to treatment initiation at each timepoint. A time-to-event outcome analysis was also done, with time-to-event curves compared using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The proportionality of hazards was tested by inspection of Schönfeld residuals for each variable included. We analysed univariate and multivariate associations between time-to-treatment initiation using clinically important variables selected a priori for the model. We assessed inter-rater agreement between van-based and laboratory-based Xpert using the kappa statistic (?). 21  Statistical analyses were done with OpenEpi, GraphPad Prism, and Stata.

The patient denied fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. He had a history of alcoholism. The patient was not homeless and was never tested for HIV. Five months before presentation he was diagnosed as having pulmonary TB on sputum examination for acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear and in the initial cultures was susceptible to all anti-TB medications. The patient was not under directly observed therapy (DOT), and because of financial reasons he had discontinued therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide 3 weeks earlier. Physical examination showed a cathectic, alert, and oriented patient who was in mild respiratory distress. His pulse was 130 beats per minute, his respiration rate was 42 breaths per minute, his temperature was 37.2°C (99°F), and his blood pressure was 132/90 mm Hg. Oral thrush was present. Lung examination revealed bilateral basal rales and decreased breath sounds over apices. Neurologic examination was normal. Chest radiograph showed pulmonary infiltrates, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and right shift of the heart shadow. Sputum for Gram stain examination and AFB smear and culture and blood culture were sent. Serum electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were normal. His white blood cell count was 3.71 109/L (normal range, 4.7-6.1), polymorphonuclear neutrophils were 93% (segs 82%, bands 11%), monocytes were 4%, and lymphocytes were 3%. Arterial blood gas, while receiving 100% fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2), showed a pH of 7.419 (normal range, 7.35-7.54), PCO2 of 40 torr (normal range, 35-45), PO2 of 74 torr (normal range, 80-100), and oxygen saturation 95%. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia at 127 beats per minute. CD4 cell count was not done. A request by staff to perform an HIV test was denied by the patient. The patient wanted a “do not resuscitate or intubate” status because of his chronic debilitated illness. He was placed in respiratory isolation and immediately treated with intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, for a presumptive diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, oral fluconazole, isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Corticosteroid was not given. The patient developed severe respiratory distress and profound hypoxemia with oxygen saturation of 75% while receiving an inspired oxygen of 100%. During preparation to insert a left chest tube for a possible tension pneumothorax, the patient developed bradycardia and then cardiac arrest and expired 8 hours after admission. Autopsy examination showed bullae of the upper lobes, bronchopneumonia, bronchiectasis, abscesses of the lower lobes, empyema, fibrous pleural adhesions, pneumomediastinum, and loculated left pneumothorax. Caseating necrotizing granulomas and AFB, on smear examination, were present in hilar, peribronchial, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the spleen, and the lungs. Cultures grew only Mycobactirum tuberculosis, which was susceptible to all medications. Examination of other organs for AFB smears and cultures was negative. Papanicolaou and silver stains for Pneumocystis carinii were negative. Postmortem examination for the HIV was positive. ",0

Radiographs showed talar head destruction. An MRI scan was arranged to clarify whether this was an infective process or Charcot's arthropathy and the radiological features are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The swelling was biopsied under image guidance and the histology confirmed granulomatous caseating necrosis consistent with tuberculosis. The patient was started on multimodal anti-tuberculous therapy and over the next year his symptoms improved. However, the patient was never pain free and needed periods of splintage in an aircast boot. The patient completed his anti-tuberculous treatment and was discharged by the infectious disease unit. After 18 months, the patient was still struggling to mobilise and radiographs confirmed advanced collapse and degeneration in the talonavicular joint. It is planned for him to have a talonavicular joint arthrodesis when he returns to the UK.   2.2 Case 2 A 50 year old Asian woman with psoriasis presented with an 18 month history of right ankle pain to the rheumatologists. The patient's inflammatory markers were normal as well as a quantiferon test. She was treated for presumed psoriatic arthropathy of the ankle joint. The patient had two steroid injections in the ankle joint and was on methotrexate and leflunomide when she was seen in the foot and ankle clinic. The patient was noted to have a swollen and warm right ankle with reduced range of movement. Radiographs showed bony destruction in the tibia and talus and erosion of the fibula as illustrated in Fig. 2 . An urgent arthrotomy and biopsy was arranged. Macroscopically, thick grey synovium was found in the joint space and advance joint degeneration was present. The histology showed granulomatous inflammation with epitheloid granuloma including multinucleate giant cells and a peripheral rim of lymphoid cells. The patient was started on multimodal therapy and is on a second course of treatment due to recurrence of the disease. Her last radiographs showed advanced degeneration and deformity in the ankle joint and the patient is likely to require an ankle arthrodesis in the near future.  ",0
837,S2451993616301815,Choroidal neovascularization secondary to tuberculosis: Presentation and management," 2 Findings  2.1 Case 1 A 57-year-old Korean female was diagnosed with “tuberculous uveitis” in both eyes (OU) by an outside ophthalmologist based on a positive tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay. The patient was started on quadruple anti-tuberculosis therapy and oral prednisone 10mg daily, but pyrimethamine and ethambutol were discontinued after two weeks due to intolerable side effects. The patient received an intravitreal triamcinolone injection in the left eye (OS) for distorted central vision. Three months later, she presented with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/30 in the right eye (OD) and 20/40 OS. Exam was notable for vitritis OU, macular CNV, subretinal tissue, cystoid edema, and peripheral chorioretinal scars OS (Fig. 1 ). Fluorescein angiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and indocyanine green revealed a Type 1 choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) parafoveally OS (Fig. 1). Autofluorescence (AF) was notable for peripapillary hypoautofluorescence with hyperfluorescence at the edges of the chorioretinal lesions OS. The patient was continued on anti-tuberculosis therapy and corticosteroids. After three intravitreal bevacizumab injections with persistent sub- and intraretinal fluid OS, the patient was switched to aflibercept with notable improvement. Six weeks later, the fluid recurred, and the patient's oral prednisone was increased to 20mg daily for one week, followed by 15mg daily thereafter. There was a slight improvement in the macular edema, and after nine months of anti-tuberculosis treatment with an ongoing oral prednisone taper, the patient has remained quiescent.   2.2 Case 2 A 76-year-old Indian male with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate was referred for “tuberculous serpiginoid chorioretinitis” diagnosed two years ago based on a positive interferon-gamma release assay. The patient underwent triple anti-tuberculosis therapy for six months, after which he developed CNV OS then OD. He received multiple intravitreal bevacizumab injections OU with limited response. Upon referral, the patient's BCVA was 20/100 OD and 20/200 OS. Examination revealed vitritis and scattered hypopigmented chorioretinal scars throughout the macula and periphery OU (Fig. 2 ). AF and FA showed active inflammation OU and a large macular CNVM OS. OCT revealed Type 2 choroidal neovascularization and extensive subretinal fibrosis. Because of concern for resistant mycobacteria, the patient was placed on quadruple therapy and oral prednisone 20mg daily and received an intravitreal bevacizumab injection OS. After six months of anti-tuberculosis treatment and continuing on a slow prednisone taper, there persisted an area of subretinal fluid OS. Given the poor visual potential and lack of active inflammation, the patient elected to observe.   2.3 Case 3 A 39-year-old Vietnamese female without past medical history who immigrated to the United States at an early age presented complaining of a “blind spot” and photopsias OD for three weeks. She reported a similar blind spot OS which never resolved. On initial presentation, BCVA was 20/30 OU. Examination revealed trace vitritis OU, hypopigmented peripapillary lesions OD, and scattered old chorioretinal scars OS (Fig. 3 ). FA did not demonstrate any leakage. Based on a positive tuberculin skin test, she was diagnosed with tuberculous multifocal choroiditis and started on a nine-month course of triple therapy and oral prednisone 40mg daily. Ethambutol was discontinued two weeks later due to dizziness and nausea. The intraocular inflammation subsequently subsided, but six months into the course of treatment, macular CNV developed OD (Fig. 3). This responded well to a single intravitreal bevacizumab injection, after which she received two more as a loading dose. Four years later, she developed intermittent CNVMs OU, which were treated with bevacizumab eight times OD and two times OS. New active chorioretinal lesions were seen on autofluorescence OU, and the patient was re-started on rifampin, isoniazid, and oral prednisone 40mg daily. Anti-VEGF injections were switched to aflibercept, of which she received four injections OD and two OS. After completing one year of anti-tuberculosis therapy, the patient has since remained quiescent with BCVA 20/30 OU.   2.4 Case 4 A 65 year-old Indian male with history of a positive tuberculin skin test in 1986 for which he underwent one year of quadruple therapy presented with a history of tuberculous chorioretinitis OU. Based on review of outside records, the patient had developed a recurrent macular CNVM OS for which he received five ranibizumab injections, most recently two years ago. On presentation, BCVA was hand motions OD and 20/100 OS. Exam was notable for extensive subretinal scars, chorioretinal atrophy, and pigmentary changes OD greater than OS (Fig. 4 ). There was currently no evidence of active uveitis on evaluation, and OCT images did not demonstrate the presence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid. He has remained quiescent for the past year.

849,S097656621630087X,Tuberculosis – ‘The great masquerader’ presenting as a dumb-bell-shaped intradural extramedullary tumor in a 20-year-old female," 2 Case report A 20-year-old female presented with complaints of insidious onset gradually leading to progressive weakness of both lower limbs along with decreased sensations below the waist for over the past two months. There was no associated history of back pain, deformity in the spine, fever, loss of body weight/appetite, and bladder or bowel complaints. She did not give any history of trauma, any urological procedures, recent vaccination, or any history suggestive of a recent viral infection. The general and systemic examination was within normal limit. There was no tenderness or deformity in spine. On neurological examination, higher mental functions and upper limbs were normal. On the other hand, there was clasp-knife spasticity in lower limbs with bilateral ankle clonus. Muscle power of lower limbs was grossly 2/5. Superficial abdominal reflexes were absent in lower abdominal quadrants and Babinski's sign was present bilaterally. The Beevor's sign was also present. Sensory examination revealed more than 80% subjective sensory loss below L1 dermatome with loss of bladder and bowel sensation. A provisional diagnosis of compressive myelopathy at vertebral level of D7 and spinal level of D10 was made. Hematolgical investigations were essentially normal. Plain radiographs of spine were normal. MRI scans showed an ill-defined, dumb-bell-shaped homogenous T1 iso- to hypointense and T2 iso- to hyperintense, intradural, extramedullary soft tissue lesion at the level of D7-D8 vertebral body causing anterolateral displacement of cord (Figs. 1 and 2 ). A provisional, clinic radiological diagnosis of nerve sheath tumor was made and the patient was planned for surgical decompression. Because of progressive neurological deterioration with loss of bladder and bowel control, the patient required absolute surgical decompression. A T-shaped incision was made centering over D9 spinous process; posterior approach was used; and after laminectomy at D9 and D10 vertebrae, the dural surface was found to be thickened and irregular, and there was a 0.5cm×0.5cm raw surface. On slitting the dura, CSF was not reached. Hence, further, the laminae were cleared using high-speed oscillating burr. On further slitting the dura, a bead of pus came out (Fig. 3 ). This was immediately sent for G. stain, AFB stain, TB PCR, culture, and sensitivity. There was associated granulation tissue surrounding the pus, which was removed to decompress the cord, and this was sent for frozen section biopsy. Dural repair with 4-0 nylon continuous suture was done. The results showed acid-fast bacilli on smear and granulomas consistent with the diagnosis of tuberculosis (Figs. 4 and 5  ). The patient was started on antitubercular therapy, now consisting of 4 drugs (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol). She was given intensive-phase therapy for 3 months and continuation phase of the therapy for 9 months (Rifampicin and Isoniazid). There was complete neurological recovery 6 months post-surgery. The chemotherapy was stopped 12 months back and there are no clinicoradiological signs suggestive of recrudescence of disease. ",0

856,S1047279799000113,"An Evaluation of the Completeness of Tuberculosis Case Reporting Using Hospital Billing and Laboratory Data; Wisconsin, 1995"," 2 Methods  2.1 Wisconsin TB Registry The Tuberculosis Program, Bureau of Public Health, Wisconsin Division of Health maintains a registry of all verified TB cases among Wisconsin residents. During 1995, reported cases were verified based on the 1990 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) clinical case definition or laboratory criteria for diagnosis (5) and included in the 1995 calendar year case count based on the United States Public Health Service recommendations for counting reported TB cases (6). Cases were also included if the health-care provider diagnosed TB in a patient and treated the patient with two or more anti-TB medications. However, for this analysis cases that were diagnosed by the provider but did not meet the CDC/CSTE clinical case definition or laboratory criteria for diagnosis were excluded. Suspect TB cases which are not verified are not included in the registry but are recorded in separate files.   2.2 Hospital Discharge Data Records of persons who were discharged during 1995 with a TB code [an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of 010–018 (7)] as any of the diagnoses (up to nine were possible) were obtained from the Wisconsin Office of Health Care Information which maintains a billing database of all hospitalizations in acute-care non-federal Wisconsin hospitals. Using date of birth, sex, the encrypted name code, race, ethnicity, and zip code, records of repeat hospitalizations of the same person and of persons with addresses outside of Wisconsin were manually identified and deleted. The hospital discharge records were compared with the TB registry and the suspect TB case records. For patients not reported as case-patients or suspects, hospital discharge records were requested from the hospital identified in the discharge record. Determining whether the person had illness that met the verification criteria for TB was made by a physician in consultation with Tuberculosis Program staff by using the hospital discharge summary, laboratory data, and in some cases, additional medical records.   2.3 Laboratory Data A list of all Wisconsin laboratories registered as performing mycobacteriology was obtained from the regional Health Care Financing Administration Office. Letters were sent to these 63 laboratories, laboratories of Wisconsin Veterans' Administration hospitals, and 11 out-of-state referral laboratories identified by Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene and Tuberculosis Program staff as possibly used by Wisconsin clinics and laboratories. The letters requested laboratories to list persons who had clinical specimens from which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) complex was isolated during 1995, the person's date of birth, dates of specimen collection, type of specimen, and name and address of submitting hospital, clinic, or physician. If no mycobacteriologic identification was done at the laboratory, their referral laboratory was contacted. Medical records of unreported patients with a M. tuberculosis isolate were obtained to determine if the person had illness that met the verification criteria for TB.   2.4 Statistical Analysis The unit of analysis was the person. The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity for TB of the data source were defined as PPV = [(r + u)/p] *100 and sensitivity = [(r + u)/(R + U)] *100, where r = number of persons with reported verified TB in the data source, u = number of persons with unreported verified TB in the data source, p = number of persons identified in the data source as potentially having TB, R = total number of persons with verified reported TB cases from all data sources, and U = total number of verified unreported TB cases from all data sources. Statistical analysis ws done by using SAS Version 6.08 (Cary, NC).  ",0

871,S0022519316300145,Mathematical modeling and systems pharmacology of tuberculosis: Isoniazid as a case study," 2 Material and methods The general model framework was similar to that of our prototype model for rifampin (Goutelle et al., 2011). The full model was based on three submodels: a pharmacokinetic (PK) model, a pharmacodynamic (PD) model, and a pathophysiological immune response model.  2.1 Pharmacokinetic model A three-compartment, 10-parameters model with an oral depot compartment was used as the PK model for INH. In a previously published population pulmonary PK study, this model adequately described plasma, epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and alveolar cells (AC) concentrations of INH in 89 subjects, including a majority of healthy volunteers and a few TB patients (Lalande et al., 2015). This modeling study was based on PK data from a previous work which determined INH concentrations in plasma, ELF and AC, with macrophages accounting for the majority of the cellular sample content (Conte et al., 2002). The PK model was based on the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODE):  (1)   d   X   a   / d t = ?   k   a   ?   X   a         (2)   d   X   1   / d t =   k   a   ?   X   a   –   k   e   ?   X   1   –   k   12   ?   X   1   +   k   21   ?   X   2         (3)   d   X   2   / d t =   k   12   ?   X   1   –   k   21   ?   X   2   –   k   23   ?   X   2   +   k   32   ?   X   3         (4)   d   X   3   / d t =   k   23   ?   X   2   –   k   32   ?   X   3         (5)     k   e   =   k   i   +   A   S   ?   k   s      where Xa , X 1, X 2 and X 3 are the amount of INH in the absorption (or depot) compartment, the central compartment (plasma concentrations), the ELF compartment and the AC compartment (all in mg), respectively; ka  (h?1) is the absorption rate constant, ke  (h?1) is the elimination rate constant from the central compartment and it is function of the acetylator status (AS); AS is a binary variable whose value is equal to 0 for slow acetylators and 1 for fast acetylators; and k 12, k 21, k 23 and k 32 (h?1) are the between-compartment transfer rate constants. The other PK parameters are the three volumes of distribution from the following output equations:  (6)     C   P L A S M A   =   X   1   /   V   P L A S M A         (7)     C   E L F   =   X   2   /   V   E L F         (8)     C   C E L L   =   X   3   /   V   C E L L      where CPLASMA , CELF  and CCELL  are the INH concentrations in the central compartment, the ELF compartment, and the AC compartment (in mg/L) respectively; VPLASMA  represents the volume of distribution in the central compartment, VELF  in the ELF compartment and VCELL  in the AC compartment (all in L).   2.2 Pharmacodynamic model The PD model links INH concentration at the effect site with its antibacterial effect. The effect of INH on drug-susceptible bacteria was described by the following equation:  (9)     dN    dt     =    K   gmax    N   (   1 ?    N     N   max      )   (   1 ?      C     ?   g         C    50   g      ?   g      +    C     ?   g        )   ?    K   kmax    N      C     ?   k         C    50   k      ?   k      +    C     ?   k            In this equation, N is the number of bacteria, Kgmax  is the maximum growth rate constant of M. tuberculosis (in h?1), Kkmax  is the maximum killing rate (h?1), Nmax  is the maximum number of bacteria, C is the INH concentration at the effect site (in mg/L), ?g  and ?k  are the Hill coefficients of sigmoidicity (no unit) for the effect on growth and killing, respectively, and C 50g  and C 50k  are the median effect concentrations (in mg/L) for the effect on growth and killing, respectively. This equation was derived from the model used by Gumbo et al. to describe the effect of INH and other anti-TB drugs on both drug-sensitive and resistant M. tuberculosis in an in vitro hollow-fiber system (Gumbo et al., 2007b). The parameters of the equation are defined in  Table 1. Of note, the effect of INH on resistant subpopulations of M. tuberculosis was not included in the present model. The bacterial dynamics is assumed to result from logistic bacterial growth and drug-mediated killing. The drug also inhibits the bacterial growth, so the antibacterial effect of the drug results from both killing and growth inhibition.   2.3 Tuberculous pathophysiological model The immune response model published by Kirschner?s group was used to simulate bacterial dynamics from the first day of TB infection (Marino and Kirschner, 2004; Wigginton and Kirschner, 2001). Briefly, the lung and lymph node model is a system of 17 ODE which describes the time-course of the human immune response in the lung and lymph node during TB infection (Marino and Kirschner, 2004). Each ODE describes the dynamics of the 17 variables included in the model. In the lung compartment, the 13 variables included are: resident (MR), activated (MA), and infected (MI) macrophages; interferon gamma (IFN?) and interleukins IL12, IL10, and IL4; T-lymphocyte precursor (Th0), Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes; immature dendritic cells (IDC); and extracellular (BE) and intracellular (BI) M. tuberculosis bacilli. For the lymph node compartment, there are four variables: naïve T-cells (T), T-lymphocyte precursors (Th0ln), IL12 (IL12ln), and mature dendritic cells (MDC). In the next sections, we only describe the incorporation of the PK-PD model of INH into the pathophysiological immune response model and the implementation of the full model. Further details on the disease model itself can be found in the original publications from this group (Marino and Kirschner, 2004; Wigginton and Kirschner, 2001).   2.4 The final model The final full model was built by connecting the PK-PD model of INH with the TB pathophysiological model resulting in a system of 21 ODE. Actually, only two equations of the bacterial dynamics were altered in the immune response model, as shown below. The other 15 equations of this model have remained unchanged from the original publication (Marino and Kirschner, 2004). The PD equation (Eq. (9)) was incorporated into the dynamics of the extracellular bacteria (BE ) in the lungs as follows:  (10)      d    B   E     dt    =    K    gmax   (  E  )       B   E     (    1  ?      B   E       B    E   max       )   (   1 ?      C   ELF     ?   g         C    50   g      ?   g      +    C   ELF     ?   g        )   ?    K    kmax   (   E   )       B   E        C   ELF     ?   k         C    50   k      ?   k      +    C   ELF     ?   k        ?    k   15      M   A     B   E     ?    k   18      M   R     B   E     +    k   14      N   1     M   1     (        T   T       M   I           T   T       M   I      +    c   4      )   +    k   17     N    M   I    (       B   I   m       B   I   m    + (      N    M   I     )    m        )  ?    k   2    (    N   2    )     M   R     (      B   E        B   E     +    c   9      )   ?    d   12      B   E    IDC        The dynamics of intracellular bacteria (BI) in the lungs was modified as follows:  (11)      d    B   I     dt    =    K    gmax   (  I  )      B   I    (   1 ?      B   I   m       B   I   m    +    (   N    M   I    )   m      )   (   1 ?      C   CELL     ?   g         C    50   g      ?   g      +    C   CELL     ?   g        )   ?    K    kmax   (  I  )      B   I       C   CELL     ?   k         C    50   k      ?   k      +    C   CELL     ?   k        ?    k   17    N    M   I    (      B   I   m       B   I   m    +    (   N    M   I    )   m      )   +    k   2    (    N   2    )    M   R    (      B   E       B   E    +    c   9      )   ?    k   14     N   1     M   I    (        T   T       M   I           T   T       M   I      +    c   4      )       In the presence of INH, we assumed that drug concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (CELF ) and alveolar cells (CCELL ) drove the antibacterial effect of INH on extracellular and intracellular M. tuberculosis, respectively. Those concentrations are provided by the PK model (Eqs. (1)–(8)). The PK-PD parameters of Eqs. (10) and (11) are defined in Table 1. The parameters of the physiological model are: the infection rate of MR by BE (k 2), MI killing rate by T-cells (k 14), BE killing rate by MA (k 15), MI death rate due to bacterial overload (k 17), BE killing rate by MR (k 18) and IDC uptake rate of BE (d 12).   2.5 Parameter values and simulation settings All simulations with the final model were performed using the Matlab software (version 8.2, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The 21 ODE-system was solved by use of the ode15s solver implemented in Matlab. All simulations of INH therapy were set as two successive time periods, as previously described for our rifampin model (Goutelle et al., 2009). In the first period, the model was used to simulate the development of active TB disease. The initial conditions used for the simulations were as follows: 5×105 resident macrophages per mL, 4×103 naïve T-cells per cm3 of lymph node tissue, 5×104 immature dendritic cells per cm3 of lymph node tissue, 100 extracellular bacteria per mL. Initial conditions for the other variables were set to zero. In this period, there was no drug administration and so, no drug effect was simulated. Since all parameters had fixed values, only one trajectory was simulated. In the second period, INH therapy was arbitrarily introduced after 6 months, when a high bacterial load had been achieved in lungs (approximately 9.5×108 extracellular bacteria per mL). Various INH regimens, in terms of doses, were simulated for 30 days. The simulations duration was much shorter than the standard treatment duration (6 months) as we specifically wanted to address the bactericidal activity of INH during the first days of therapy. PK variability was introduced in the modeling framework using the individual PK parameter values (Bayesian posterior estimates) describing the plasma and lung disposition of INH in 89 subjects, estimated in a recently published PK study (Lalande et al., 2015). A summary of the individual PK parameter values used in the simulations is presented in  Table 2. As a consequence of PK variability, 89 individual trajectories for PK and PD (including BE and BI) variables were displayed in period 2. Also, because INH displays a well-known genetic polymorphism influencing its inactivation by acetylation, two acetylator status were considered in the simulations (slow and fast acetylators). All simulations were performed in both slow (43 subjects) and fast (46 subjects) acetylators identified in the PK study.   2.6 Simulations of isoniazid therapy and sensitivity analysis We first simulated different INH dosage regimens to assess the ability of the full model to predict, qualitatively and quantitatively, the antibacterial effect of the drug. Then, the full model with INH was used as a tool to study the influence of host and drug parameters on drug effect. We performed a global sensitivity analysis using the GUI-HDMR Matlab toolbox developed by Ziehn and Tomlin (2009). This approach uses high dimensional model representation (HDMR) to assess the input-output relationships of complex models. Briefly, the method quantifies the relative contribution of selected model inputs to the variance of a chosen model output. The software provides a sensitivity index quantifying this contribution for each input and permits to rank inputs according to their contribution, i.e. their relative influence on the output. In the analysis of our model input-output relationships, the input parameters were PK-PD and pathophysiological parameters of Eqs. (10) and (11). The input parameters are detailed in  Table 3 along with the ranges used. We randomly generated a set of 10,000 values for each parameter, assuming uniform distribution of all parameters within the defined ranges, using the Matlab software. Because of computational issues, we did not investigate the influence of other parameters of the immune response model. Two sets of output parameters were considered: the bactericidal activity calculated as the decline in extracellular bacteria (log10/mL) between day 0 and day 2 (corresponding to early EBA) and the bactericidal activity between day 2 and day 14 (extended EBA). The number of samples used for the HDMR analysis was 10,000. The variance reduction method applied was the correlation method and a threshold value for parameter screening was set to 0.1%.   2.7 Units INH concentrations in plasma and lungs were measured in milligram per liter (mg/L) (Conte et al., 2002). For the other variables in the lung and lymph node compartments, we assumed that 1cm3 of tissue equals 1mL. All quantities were expressed per mL of volume.   2.8 Analysis of the results The analysis mainly focused on the bacterial dynamics predicted by the full model. Results from simulations were compared with clinical data of EBA. The EBA is usually measured during the first two or five days of therapy. However, measurements up to 14 days may be performed and have been called “extended EBA” (Donald and Diacon, 2008). From the simulations, we calculated a model-based surrogate of EBA as follows: [log10BE(t 1) – log10BE(t 2)]/(t 2–t 1), where BE(t 1) and BE(t 2) are the numbers of extracellular bacteria calculated just before the administration of an INH dose, at time t 1 and t 2, respectively. Thus, it was assumed that the decrease in the number of extracellular bacteria reflects the EBA, which is the decrease in the count of viable bacteria measured in sputum samples from patients. This decrease in BE was calculated between day 0 and day 2, day 0 and day 5, day 0 and day 14, and between day 2 and day 14. The bactericidal activities were compared with published values of EBA calculated for the same time intervals (Chambers et al., 1998; Chan et al., 1992; Dietze et al., 2001; Donald et al., 2004, 1997; Gosling et al., 2003; Hafner et al., 1997; Jindani et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2006; Pletz et al., 2004; Sirgel et al., 2000, 1997, 1993).

TB can affect the orbit and external eye in a wide variety of ways, and accurate diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preventing permanent damage. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, and ophthalmologists and infectious disease specialists should work together in the treatment of ocular TB. ",0
880,S0732889306004780,Mycobacterium tuberculosis sternal wound infection after open heart surgery: a case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 57-year-old Chinese woman who had undergone CABG by median sternotomy for triple-vessel disease 8 months ago presented to our hospital with 2 discharging sinuses over the sternotomy wound for 2 months. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy requiring continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 3 years. She made an uneventful recovery after the CABG surgery and was discharged from the hospital 3 weeks after the operation. She then noticed to have purulent discharge from a nodular lesion over the sternotomy wound 6 months after the operation, which failed to improve with wound dressing and antibiotic for 8 weeks. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 37.0 °C, with two 1 × 1.5-cm nodular lesions discharging serosangious fluid with mild erythema over the lower half of sternotomy wound. A chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) of thorax showed worn-out wire loop over the sternum with osteomyelitic changes and multiple rim-enhancing fluid collections in the sternal region (Fig. 1 ). No parenchymal lung lesion or lymphadenopathy was observed. Her total white blood cell count was 5900 cells/mm3 (83.4% neutrophils, 13.2% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes), with hemoglobin level and platelet count of 8.3 g/dL and 155000 cells/mm3, respectively. The erythrocyte sediment rate was greater than 130 mm/h. Her liver function tests were all within the normal ranges, and the creatinine level remained stable at 700 to 1000 ?mol/L, with good CAPD output and clear CAPD dialysate. Culture of wound swab yielded methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient was given intravenous cloxacillin. Wound debridement was performed 4 days after admission. During the operation, necrosis of xyphoid cartilage and surrounding soft tissue was noted. The lower one-third of the sternum was partially dehisced with fibrous union, and the rest of the sternum was stable. Gram stain of the debrided tissue was negative, but Ziehl–Neelsen stain identified the presence of acid-fast bacilli, which was compatible with the histologic finding of acid-fast bacilli with Langhans giant cells and necrotizing epithelioid granulomas. Routine aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures of the debrided tissues remained negative after 48 h of incubation at 35 °C in 5% CO2. However, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the tissue was positive for M. tuberculosis complex. Three expectorate sputum samples were collected, and all were negative for acid fast bacilli and M. tuberculosis PCR. Protocol for the detection of M. tuberculosis nucleic acids by PCR has been described previously (Yuen et al., 1995). In view of the histologic and PCR results, antituberculous chemotherapy was thus initiated. Because of the problems of end-stage renal failure, gastrointestinal upset, and thrombocytopenia, her antituberculous regimen had to be adjusted, and she was subsequently stabilized on a regimen of isoniazid 200 mg daily, pyrazinamide 1 g daily, levofloxacin 500 mg, and ethambutol 1000 mg 3 times per week. The culture of the debrided tissue on Lowenstein–Jensen medium was positive for mycobacteria after 5 weeks of incubation and was identified to be M. tuberculosis. The expectorate sputum remained culture negative for mycobacteria after 8 weeks of incubation. CT thorax was repeated 3 weeks after surgery and antimycobacterial treatment, which revealed the resolution of rim-enhancing collections and reduced inflammatory changes along the sternotomy wound (Fig. 1). At the time of writing, the patient received 3 months of antituberculous treatment and showed no evidence of relapse. ",0
892,S1007570414003001,Optimal control for a tuberculosis model with undetected cases in Cameroon," 2 Modeling intervention methods  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) spreads through the air from an infectious person to a susceptible person. Two kinds of tests are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria: the tuberculin skin test and TB blood analysis. A positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria and does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection or has progressed to TB disease [12]. Other tests, such as a chest X-ray and a sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease. Some TB treatment and prevention options are carried out in some rural and urban hospitals in Cameroon. However, the treatment of mild infections, classified as latent infections in our model, is not effective in Cameroon. On the other hand, infective individuals classed as infectious in our model, require a hard treatment of six months in the hospital. As preventive measures, population can be diagnosed, and latent TB infections can be treated to reduce the bacterial load in their body. This last approach effectively reduces the risk that TB infection will progress to TB disease. Certain groups are at very high risk of developing TB disease once infected. Every effort should be made to begin appropriate treatment and to ensure completion of the entire course of treatment for latent TB infection [12]. A finite (non-constant) total population at time t, denoted by   N ( t )  , is sub-divided into the following mutually exclusive sub-populations:  S susceptible: healthy people not yet exposed to TB;   E latently infected: exposed to TB but not infectious;   I diagnosed infectious: have active TB confirmed after a sputum examination in a hospital;   J undiagnosed infectious: have not yet been to a hospital for diagnosis but are active for confirmation by a sputum examination;   L lost sight: people who have been diagnosed as having active TB, begun their treatment and quitted before the end;   R recovered: people cured after treatment in the hospital.  In Africa, reliable TB tests [23] are often missing or too expensive. Hence, TB diagnosis based on a single sputum examination can often only be classified as “probable” or “presumed”, and cannot detect cases of less infectious forms of TB [40]. Therefore, the model is based on the following assumptions, established from behaviors of people in different epidemiological classes.  1. Mtb transmission from diagnosed infectious to susceptible population, due to education on the infection is limited. it is therefore modeled using a standard mass action or frequency-dependent force of infection.   2. Mtb transmission from undiagnosed infectious to susceptible population, due to their level of education on the disease is modeled by a density-dependent force of infection.  These arguments abide on the fact that diagnosed infectious people are in most cases hospitalized for at least 2months or are advised to lessen their infectiousness in their residing neighborhood. Their distribution in the population is not necessarily homogeneous. Since undiagnosed infectious remain inside the population, there is an unlimited possibility of contacts with the susceptible population [3]. We therefore assume a density dependent force of infection for hospital inmates [4]. All recruitment is into the susceptible class and occurs at an average scale   ?  . The fixed rate of non-disease related death is   ?  , thus   1 / ?   is the average lifetime. Susceptible individuals acquire TB infection from individuals with active TB and lost sight at a rate   ? ( I , J , L )   is given by  (1)  ? ( I , J , L ) =   ?   1     I   N   +   ?   2     L   N   +   ?   3   J ,   where     ?   i   ,  i = 1 , 2 , 3  , are the effective contact rates of diagnosed, lost sight and undiagnosed infectious sufficient to transmit infection to susceptible people. The effective contact rates     ?   i     in a given population for tuberculosis are measured in effective contacts per unit time. This may be expressed as the product of the total contact rate per unit time (    ?   i    ) by the risk of infection (    ?   i    ) given contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual,     ?   i   =   ?   i     ?   i    . This risk is called the transmission risk. A proportion p of the latently-infected individuals develop fast active TB and the remainder   ( 1 - p )   develop latent TB and enter the latent class E. Among latently-infected individuals developing active TB, a fraction f is assumed to undergo a fast progression directly to the diagnosed infectious class I, while the remainder   ( 1 - f )   enters the undiagnosed infectious class J. We set     p   1   = pf  and    p   2   = p ( 1 - f ) .   Once latently infected with Mtb, an individual will remain so for life unless reactivation occurs. Latently infected individuals are assumed to acquire some immunity as a result of infection, which reduces the risk of subsequent infection but does not fully prevent it. Due to endogenous reactivation, a fraction   1 -   r   1     of latently infected individuals who did not receive effective chemoprophylaxis become infectious with a constant rate k, and reinfect after effective contact with individuals in the active TB classes or lost sight at a rate     ?   e   =   ?   1   ? ( I , J , L ) ,   where     ?   1     is the factor reducing the risk of infection as a result of acquiring immunity for latently infected individuals. Among latently infected individuals who become infectious, the fraction h is diagnosed and treated under the “Stop TB” program, while the remaining   1 - h   is not diagnosed and becomes undiagnosed infectious J. We assume that after some time suffering from TB, some undiagnosed infectious decide to go to hospital with a rate   ?  . Also, we assume that among diagnosed infectious who had begun their treatment therapy, a fraction     r   2     of I has taken all the dose and has made all the sputum examinations and will be declared cured from the disease. Some diagnosed infectious who have not finished their dose of drugs and sputum examinations or whose treatment was unsuccessful, will not return to the hospital for the rest of sputum examinations and check-up. They will enter the class of lost sight L at a constant rate   ?  . Lost sight can return to the hospital at a constant rate   ?  . As suggested by Murray et al. [29], recovered individuals can only have partial immunity. Hence, they can undergo a TB reactivation or relapse with a constant rate   ?  . The remainder can be reinfected (exogenously) after an effective contact with individuals in the active TB classes and lost sight at a rate     ?   r   =   ?   2   ? ( I , J , L ) ,   where     ?   2     is the factor reducing the risk of infection as a result of acquiring partial immunity for recovered individuals. Due to their own immunity, traditional medicine, natural recovery and drugs bought in the street (practised in sub-Saharan Africa), a fraction of lost sight and undiagnosed infectious can spontaneously recover at constant rates   ?   and   ?  , respectively and enter the latent class E and recovery class R respectively. A description of the parameters is summarized in Table 1  in appendix. Controls are represented as functions of time and assigned reasonable upper and lower bounds. In [27,28], it has been shown that undiagnosed infectious population plays a fundamental role on TB propagation through sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the optimal control strategies aim to minimize the number of undiagnosed infectious and lost sight in the population. First,   u ( t )   represents the effort on education which allows people to go to the hospital, to be diagnosed early and treated from the disease (to reduce the number of individuals that may be undiagnosed infectious). Second,   v ( t )   measures the rate of treatment of TB latent infections in each time period. The whole model flow diagram with control is shown in Fig. 1 , and given as ODE system (2) below.

( 1 + u ( t ) )  and    A   5   = ? + ? ,      subject to the initial conditions  (3)  S ( 0 ) =   S   0   ,  E ( 0 ) =   E   0   ,  I ( 0 ) =   I   0   ,  J ( 0 ) =   J   0   ,  L ( 0 ) =   L   0    R ( 0 ) =   R   0   .      Table 1 (in appendix) presents parameter values and descriptions. The control functions   u ( t )   and   v ( t )   have to be bounded and Lebesgue integrable functions.   u ( t )   represents supplementary time dependent efforts of education campaigns, applied during a time interval   [ 0 , T ]   to the whole population. The control function   v ( t )   measures the time dependent efforts on the preventive treatment of latently infected individuals to reduce the number of individuals that may be infectious. This control will have an impact on the output flow of people from the latently infected class to infectious classes. The coefficient   1 - u ( t )   is a decreasing factor for fast route flow to undiagnosed population as result of education. This factor aims to reduce the number of people becoming fast undiagnosed infectious and developing cavitation. The coefficient   v ( t )   represents the effort that prevents the inflow to the undiagnosed infectious classes to reduce the number of undiagnosed individuals developing cavitation. Our control problem involves the number of individuals with latent and active tuberculosis infections and the cost of applying chemoprophylaxis education and treatment controls   u ( t )   and   v ( t )   to be minimized subject to the differential Eq. (2). A description and the estimated values of the parameters is summarized in Table 1 such that the model fits with TB dynamics in Cameroon from 1994–2013. Note that in Eq. (2) the control   u ( t )   moves infectious individuals from classes J and L to class I and decreases the evolution to J and L classes. However, the control   v ( t )   reduces the progression rate from the latently infected class to the infectious classes. Since treatment effectively decreases the number of infectious individuals in the population, the control functions may provide a model of the impact of education and chemoprophylaxis of both latent and active infection.  Comparison to measurement data Numerical simulations of model system (2) are carried out using a linearly implicit Euler scheme in Matlab, version R2009. The total population of Cameroon in 1994 is given by   N = 13 , 240 , 337   [31]. Using measurable data, model (2) gives a very good fit to the Cameroonian data for the period 1994–2010 [39], as depicted in Fig. 2 . Estimated transmission parameters are performed using a state of the art Gauss–Newton Method as presented in [27,28] and the deterministic model appears to capture all the qualitative properties of the observed pattern. Hence, model (2) can be used to gain realistic insight into tuberculosis transmission dynamics at least for a limited period.  ",0
916,S2214250917302378,TB or not TB? Mycobacterium celatum mimicking Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A case of mistaken identity," Case presentation A 68-year-old Caucasian male presented for an infectious disease consult with intermittent fever, night sweats, atrial flutter, and a productive cough of 6-month duration. His sputum was clear/white in the morning and improved during the day although he reported that his sputum sometimes became gray during the day. The patient’s weight decreased from 210 to 130 pounds over the last year, which he described as intentional. Past medical history included a 55-year history of cigarette smoking (2 ppd), a 50-year history of marijuana use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and basal and squamous cell skin cancer. The patient reported no recent sick contacts and no one in his family had similar symptoms. The patient was born and raised in Illinois and currently lives in a rural area of Michigan with his wife, children, dogs, a parrot, and canaries. The birds are kept in cages, which he cleans without wearing a mask. He served in Vietnam from 1966 to 1968 and denied exposure to M. tuberculosis during that time. He was employed as a nurse with his most recent employment in a prison in Allegan, Michigan where he worked for 2 years before retiring 6 years ago. His PPD (purified protein derivative) tests were negative during his employment, and no inmates had a positive PPD while he worked at the prison. He indicated a remote history of close exposure to tuberculosis while working as a nurse in the 1970s when he performed CPR without a barrier on a patient with active tuberculosis. Serial chest x-rays and four PPD skin tests in the following year were negative. On examination, he appeared alert and well-oriented with decreased breath sounds bilaterally on auscultation. Chest x-rays revealed bilateral upper lobe caviation with coarse interstitial markings, parenchymal distortion, hilar retraction, and pleural thickening consistent with possible infection with M. tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, or a fungus. Computed tomography angiography of the chest demonstrated a single small embolus in the right upper lobe artery and severe emphysematous changes bilaterally, with extensive cavitation in each upper lobe consistent with a mycobacterial infection (Figs. 1–3   ). The patient was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of reactivation pulmonary tuberculosis based on his history of employment as a nurse in several hospitals and a prison, and his history of direct contact with a patient with active tuberculosis. Quadruple anti-tuberculosis therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was initiated. Sputum samples were collected for microscopic analysis and culture, and blood was collected for labs and testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C. Lab results for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were negative, however two separate acid-fast bacilli smears of sputum demonstrated numerous acid-fast bacilli. During the second week of admission, the quadruple anti-tuberculosis therapy was discontinued due to elevations in alanine aminotransferase (305?U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (185?U/L) levels, and a negative interferon gamma release assay (Quantiferon-TB Gold) for tuberculosis. Despite discontinuing the anti-tuberculosis therapy, the patient improved and was released from the hospital. The discharge plan was thoroughly discussed with the patient and a follow-up visit was scheduled. During initial outpatient follow-up two weeks later, the patient was clinically improved and reported feeling “much better.” However, repeat acid-fast bacilli stains continued to demonstrate numerous acid-fast bacilli and the patient’s chest x-ray remained unchanged. Sputum cultures were negative when examined with a direct M. tuberculosis complex gene probe (AccuProbe, Hologic), and broth cultures (Middlebrook 7H9 broth) were sent to the Michigan Department of Community Health Bureau of Laboratories and subsequently identified as M. celatum by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and chemistries. The patient was started on clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ethambutol. Four weeks later, the patient reported no fever, no sweats, diminished cough, and a sputum with decreased viscosity and coloration. The patient has continued follow up in the outpatient setting, and six months after discharge, both acid-fast bacilli smears and cultures for M. celatum have continued to be negative. ",0
917,S0028384314603698,Tuberculosis of the spine masquerading as a spine lymphoma. A case report and discussion of diagnostic and therapeutic traps," Case report A 59-year-old man, a very heavy smoker, began to complain of girdle-like thoraco-lumbar pain. He developed hyperthermia, loss of appetite and loss of body weight, and at 6 weeks from the onset of his symptoms he began to complain of leg weakness. Disability index on the Oswestry Scale was 98% (crippled). He was admitted to the neurosurgical division for investigation and treatment. His laboratory investigation revealed an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 90 mm after one hour. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a glucose level of 30 mg/dL, and increased protein concentration (5 g/L). Histological examination revealed a polymorphic image, i.e. large number of lymphocytes, single macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the involvement of the vertebra, the pedicles of T12 and the intervertebral disc between T12 and L1. There was also a large area of involvement of the surrounding soft tissues (Figs. 1 and 2  ). The oncologists diagnosed an isolated vertebral lymphoma with a very poor prognosis. The patient was put on complete bed rest and over the ensuing weeks received 6 chemotherapeutic interventions and two radiotherapy treatments in the Th 12/L1 area. The clinical condition of the patient showed a sudden and unexpected improvement and the weakness of his lower extremities disappeared. His girdle-like pain also disappeared and he began to walk. His ESR fell to 20 mm after one hour. A repeated lumbar puncture and examination of the CSF showed disappearance of the lymphocytes. New MRI showed a marked decrease of fluid in the disc and adjacent vertebral bodies. At the same time, there was an increase in the destruction of the pedicles and base of the lamina of T12 and L1. The decision was made to continue with the radiotherapy of T12 and L1. The condition of the patient deteriorated. His pain increased and he began to lose weight and he developed an allergic ring-like skin reaction over T12. A third MRI showed a pathological fracture of T12 and L1 with collapse of the vertebrae and the formation of a typical kyphosis with a marked increase in the amount of pus in the soft tissues. These findings suggested a revision of the diagnosis and the attending doctors began to consider tuberculosis as a distinct possibility (Fig. 3 ). At this point, the patient was transferred to the division of bone and joint tuberculosis of the orthopedic department. The diagnosis of tuberculosis of the spine with neurological compromise of the lower extremities was quite clear at this point. The new and appropriate treatment consisted of 10 weeks of complete bed rest and antimycobacterial drug therapy. Antimycobacterial drug therapy included: rifampicin (600 mg/daily for 12 months with ongoing control of liver function), hydrazide (300 mg daily for 12 months), pyrazinamide (1 tablet t.i.d. for 3 months with ongoing monitoring of liver function), and ethambutol (5 capsules daily for 6 months under ophthalmologist surveillance). Obviously, a definite diagnosis of tuberculosis of the spine can be risky, because a similar picture occurs in non-specific inflammation. Antimycobacterial drug therapy applied ex juvantibus and rapid improvement confirmed ongoing tuberculous infection. Within 4 weeks the patient's pain disappeared and his lower extremity function showed marked improvement. The patient was then given a Jewett brace and ambulated. A follow-up at 2 years revealed that he was pain-free and able to walk without limits. His disability score on the Oswestry scale was 16% (minimally disabled) and he scored 9 points on the Rolland-Morris scale. His skin rash had not retreated. An X-ray showed a spontaneous fusion of T12 and L1 (Fig. 4 ). ",0
945,S1198743X14603669,Splenectomy correlates with increased risk of pulmonary tuberculosis: a case–control study in Taiwan," Materials and Methods  Data sources This case–control study was designed to analyse the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Programme. Details of the insurance were described in previous studies [8–10]. Briefly, the National Health Research Institute cooperates with the Bureau of National Health Insurance to establish several data files annually using the National Health Insurance claims data for administrative use and research. The National Health Insurance Programme was implemented in 1995, covering approximately 99% of the whole population of 23.74 million people [11]. This study used two data sets of 1 000 000 individuals randomly selected from all insured claims data from 1998 to 2011. Diseases were coded based on the International Classification of Disease Diagnoses, 9th Revision of Clinical Modification (ICD-9 codes). The accuracy and validity of disease diagnosis in the National Health Insurance Research Database, such as tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus and chronic liver diseases, were demonstrated in previous studies [9,12–14]. The National Health Research Institute encrypts a patient's personal information for privacy protection and provides researchers with anonymous identification numbers associated with the relevant claim information, which includes the patient's sex, date of birth, registry of medical services and medication prescriptions. Patient consent is not required for accessing the National Health Insurance Research Database. The study was also approved by the Institutional Review Board of China Medical University and Hospital (CMU-REC-101-012).   Inclusion criteria In this case–control study, we selected subjects with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis as the case group during the period 1998–2011 based on ICD-9 codes (010, 011, 012 and 018), who were aged 20 years or older at the date of diagnosis. The index date for each case was the date of diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were identified at least twice from principal/secondary diagnoses in outpatient visits or at least once from hospitalization. For each case, four control subjects were selected for the control group, who were matched for sex, age (per 5 years) and index year of pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis. Subjects with previous diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, any cancer or HIV/AIDS before the index date were excluded.   Potential co-morbidities associated with pulmonary tuberculosis A number of co-morbidities before the index date were examined for their possible association with pulmonary tuberculosis. These were splenectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumoconiosis, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus and chronic liver diseases including cirrhosis, alcoholic liver damage, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and other types of chronic hepatitis. They were diagnosed using ICD-9 codes.   Statistical analysis Pulmonary tuberculosis cases were first compared with non-pulmonary tuberculosis controls on their proportional distributions of demographic status and co-morbidities by chi-square test for categorical variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the OR and 95% CI for association between pulmonary tuberculosis and splenectomy, after controlling for age and other co-morbidities. In addition, we evaluated the interaction effect between splenectomy and other co-morbidities on risk of pulmonary tuberculosis by using the multivariable unconditional logistic regression model. All analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical software (version 9.2 for Windows; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and all statistical tests were performed at the two-tailed significance level of p 0.05.

978,S1529943010013380,Tuberculosis of spine with neurological deficit in advanced pregnancy: a report of three cases," Patients and methods  Case I A 24-year-old Asian woman presented at 30 weeks of gestation with back pain of 4-months duration, progressive loss of motor power in the lower limbs (1/5 Medical Research Council Grading, Frankel Grade C: nonfunctional motor power below affected level) for 10 days [10,11]. The radiographs revealed a collapsed T4 vertebra with localized gibbus and a paravertebral abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated paradiscal vertebral destruction, compression of the dural sac because of granulation tissue, and edematous changes in the spinal cord [12,13]. The hematological investigations included complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and liver function tests. These investigations revealed anemia, an increased total leukocyte count with predominance of lymphocytes, and raised ESR (90 mm at the end of 1 hour), raising a strong suspicion of TB [14]. Because of strong maternal concern for fetal prematurity, subsequent neonatal survival in the available facilities, and high anesthetic and surgical risk in view of patient’s poor general condition (ie, malnutrition, anemia, and TB), urgent surgical intervention was initially deferred. The aim was to attain appropriate fetal maturity for neonatal survival in the available circumstances and also to improve maternal health. Conservative treatment with four-drug antitubercular therapy comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrizinamide on weight-adjusted doses, bed rest, and measures to improve the general condition were initiated [15]. The patient, however, had a spontaneous abortion within a week, following which an urgent anterolateral decompression through a posterior left paramedian approach by excising the posteromedial portion of the third and fourth ribs was performed [16]. Postoperatively, there was no neurological recovery at 6 weeks. At 3 months, the neurological status was unchanged although the plain radiographs demonstrated progressive increase in the kyphosis, as indicated by increase in angle A from 40° to 60°, thus indicating an unstable lesion [17]. Also noted was worsening of the back pain (visual analog scale [VAS] for pain increasing from 7 to 9)[18] and drop in the ESR to 40 mm. A magnetic resonance imaging at this stage indicated spinal cord compression because of gibbus and myelomalacia [19]. A repeat decompression through a transpedicular approach, bone grafting, and stabilization with stainless loop rectangle and sublaminar wires was performed [20].   Case II A 32-year-old Asian woman who presented at 33 weeks of gestation with back pain of 5-months duration and progressive weakness in the lower limbs for 10 days with bowel and bladder dysfunction (0/5 Medical Research Council Grading, Frankel Grade B: sensory function present and motor function absent). The radiographs showed localized gibbus at T7–T8 level (Fig. 1  and Fig. 2 ). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a paravertebral abscess, paradiscal destructive lesion with collapse of the adjacent vertebral bodies, and significant cord compression (Fig. 3 ). Hematological investigations similar to those in the first case revealed anemia, leukocytosis with lymphocyte predominance, and raised ESR (80 mm at the end of 1 hour). Four-drug antitubercular therapy, as in Case I was initiated. At 33 weeks gestation, a good fetal outcome was expected with the available neonatal care facilities. Taking the fetal outcome and neurological deficit into consideration, an urgent surgical intervention was contemplated [21]. Lower segment Caesarean section was performed, and a neonate weighing 2.4 kg and Apgar score 8 was delivered [22]. After this, the patient was repositioned in a right lateral position and a thoracotomy through the seventh intercostal space was performed. Anterior decompression through a transpleural approach and bone grafting with a left iliac crest tricortical strut was performed in the trough created between adjacent normal vertebrae. Postoperatively, the patient was confined to bed for 6 weeks till the plain radiographs indicated early incorporation of the graft. At this stage, the VAS for pain improved from 8 to 2 and the ESR dropped to 35 mm.   Case III A 30-year-old Asian woman presented at 32 weeks of gestation with neck pain of 4-months duration and progressive weakness in both the upper and the lower limbs with bowel and bladder dysfunction for 2 weeks. On admission, she had spastic quadriplegia (0/5 Medical Research Council Grading, Frankel Grade A: absence of all sensory and motor functions). The radiographs revealed destruction of C3 body along with lower half of C2 vertebra. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated paradiscal destruction of C2 and C3 vertebral bodies and significant cord compression because of the granulation tissue. The hematological investigations as described earlier revealed anemia, leukocytosis with lymphocytic predominance, and raised ESR (102 mm at the end of 1 hour). At this stage, four-drug antitubercular therapy was initiated. Taking in to account the gestational age and neurological deficit, urgent lower segment Caesarean section was performed. Neonate weighing 2.6 kg and Apgar score 9 was delivered. This was immediately followed by anterior cervical decompression through a high anterior cervical approach and bone grafting using a tricortical strut graft harvested from the left iliac crest. Postoperatively, the patient was nursed in supine position for 6 weeks till early signs of graft incorporation were noted on plain radiographs; the VAS for pain improved from 7 to 1, and the ESR dropped to 65 mm. In all the three patients, tissue obtained intraoperatively was cultured to confirm the diagnosis of TB [23,24]. The antibiotic sensitivity was ascertained to the standard antitubercular drugs comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrizinamide. The antitubercular therapy was continued for 1 year in all the patients, during which the hematological parameters such as ESR and leukocyte counts were monitored. All three patients tested negative for serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus infection. To avoid deep venous thrombosis, measures such as sequential compression devices, stockings, and passive limb mobilization were initiated, although the use of heparin or its variants was avoided because of the risk of postsurgical bleeding and issues related to monitoring and cost. Antepartum glucocorticoids were administered to the second and third patient to enhance fetal lung maturity. Fetal assessment was based on clinical obstetric evaluation and ultrasonographic studies.

979,S2452315116300315,Thailand's health screening policy and practices: The case of Burmese migrants with tuberculosis," Materials and Methods The purpose of study was to investigate the health care services system, the prevention and control of TB, and the relevant health policies of the Thai government. The ethnographic approach was used to investigate migrant workers attending health care services at Sinsamut Hospital (pseudonym used to preserve anonymity). The researchers made use of existing records and performed in-depth interviews and participant observation during health screening, TB treatment, and home visits. Research participants were purposively selected and consisted of: 13 migrant workers with TB, 4 members of a TB patient self-help group, 4 migrant health volunteers, and 17 family members of TB patients. Sinsamut Hospital operates an outpatient clinic (OPD) for TB treatment every Thursday. At the clinic, the researchers were able to recruit Burmese migrants with TB into the study and observe the process of health service provision to migrant TB patients, while developing a friendly relationship with them. Once the TB patients gave consent to participate in the research, the researcher asked for their permission to visit them at home. The researcher planned to visit migrants with TB about 3–5 times in order to conduct in-depth interviews with them and family members, including their care givers. Observation was also conducted during the home visits. In total, 13 Burmese migrants with TB (10 females and 3 males) were recruited for the research. Criteria for sample recruitment were: (1) being a TB patient; (2) being Burmese and having been treated or presently undergoing treatment; (3) being treated for more than two months; (4) living in Thailand for more than two years; (5) being a patient and migrant worker with or without health insurance; and (6) ability to communicate in the Thai language. The researcher analyzed the data using content analysis. Data compilation was conducted by verbatim transcript from audio tape. The researcher reviewed the content numerous times to ensure clear understanding of the context of migrant community life, the transnational migration experience, and the behavioral norms of different communities. Data of similar types were grouped under the same theme while data of different types were put into separate themes. A triangulation approach was employed in the whole analysis process. Information sources and data collection from in-depth interviews and observation were cross-checked, interpreted, and verified. This study was certified by the Ethics Committee, Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Mahidol University. ",0
1002,S0303846708003004,Spinal intramedullary tuberculosis: A series of 15 cases," 2 Materials and methods This is a retrospective study at our institute, conducted over a period of twenty one years (1985–2006). Fifteen patients of spinal intramedullary tuberculosis were treated at our institute during this period. Data pertaining to these patients were retrieved from patient records. Clinical, radiological and pathological data were reviewed along with final outcome at discharge. Investigations included routine hemogram (including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR) and serum biochemistry. Human immunodeficiency virus testing was done in 5 cases (negative in all). Chest X-ray, ultrasound abdomen and urine analysis were done to rule out source of infection. Six patients had non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) spine. Five patients underwent CT myelography and thirteen patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spine. Nine patients also had a NCCT/or MRI brain. Three patients were conservatively managed on antitubercular therapy (ATT) alone (given for 18 months while rest underwent laminectomy with decompression of abscess/tuberculoma with postoperative antitubercular therapy for 18 months. Biopsy was obtained on all surgically operated cases. Postoperatively all patients received a short course of steroids in the form of dexamethasone/methyl predniosolone, which was rapidly tapered off. All patients were started on antitubercular therapy to be received for 18 months duration (4 drugs (RHEZ, rifampicin 10mg/kg body weight, isoniazid 5mg/kg body weight, ethambutol 15mg/kg body weight and pyrazinamide 25mg/kg body weight) for 6 months and 2 drugs (Rifampicin and Isoniazid for 12 months).

1007,S0163445309000826,Alcohol use and clinical manifestations of tuberculosis," Methods This was a retrospective study of all adult (>14 years old) cases of tuberculosis reported to the North Carolina Tuberculosis Control Program between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2006. In North Carolina, data from confirmed cases of tuberculosis are routinely recorded by county public health nurses and entered into a central database. Available data elements include the following: demographics (gender, race/ethnicity, age group); occupation (healthcare worker, correctional facility, migrant worker, other, not employed); year of tuberculosis report; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status; homelessness during the previous year; residence in a correctional facility or in a long term care facility; excess alcohol use (yes/no/unknown); injection or non-injection illicit drug use (yes/no/unknown); disease site (pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or both); method of tuberculosis medication administration (self-administered or directly observed therapy); tuberculosis drug resistance (yes/no/unknown); disease verification criteria; history of previous tuberculosis; vital status; and whether tuberculosis treatment was completed. The database also includes clinical information including results of sputum smear and culture, tuberculin skin test results at diagnosis, chest radiograph results, the initial tuberculosis treatment regimen, and the reason for stopping therapy (successful completion, death, lost to follow-up). Although excess alcohol use is not defined quantitatively, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide general guidelines for public health staff to use when making this assessment. Suggested criteria for classifying tuberculosis cases as having excess alcohol use in the previous 12 months include evidence of participation in an alcohol treatment program, documented medical conditions associated with excess alcohol use (e.g. cirrhosis, pancreatitis), or a diagnosis of alcoholism in medical records. 5  Overall, 192 tuberculosis cases, or 3.5% of the study population, had missing status for alcohol use. The proportion of tuberculosis cases with missing status for alcohol use declined from 9.7% in 1994 to 0.6% in 2006. For purposes of this analysis, subjects with missing or “unknown” status for alcohol use were grouped with persons who did not use excess alcohol. An anonymised database including all cases reported from 1994 to 2006 was provided to the authors for analysis. The study protocol was approved by the North Carolina State Institutional Review Board and the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.  Statistical methods Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to describe bivariate associations between excess alcohol use and categorical independent variables. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess time trends. Because excess alcohol use was prevalent in our population, odds ratios would not accurately reflect the magnitude of risk associated with specific risk factors. 6  Log binomial modeling was therefore performed with SAS PROC GENMOD to estimate prevalence ratios for risk factors associated with excess alcohol use and with potentially more infectious (pulmonary, smear-positive, and cavitary) clinical manifestations of tuberculosis. 7  Unless otherwise specified, subjects with missing data for a given variable were excluded from multivariable models that included that variable. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  ",0

1028,S1297319X04000417,Salmonella typhi osteitis can mimic tuberculosis. A report of three cases," 2 Case reports  2.1 Case 1 This 37-year-old woman from Mali was admitted in June 2002 for pain in the left forearm with local edema and hyperpigmentation. Her medical history was unremarkable and she had been living in France for 5 years. She reported a 10-year history of pain over the proximal part of the left ulna with episodes of local edema but no fever or decline in general health. She denied injury to the limb. At admission, her body temperature was normal and her general health good. Findings were normal from auscultation of the heart and lungs, palpation of the abdomen, and palpation of the lymph node sites. Examination of the left forearm showed swelling, warmth, tenderness to palpation, and hyperpigmentation over the upper third of the ulna. Blood cell counts were normal, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 33 mm/h, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 12.3 mg/l, and liver and kidney function tests were normal. HIV serology and the TPHA-VDRL were negative. The chest radiograph was normal. An intradermal tuberculin test produced a 10-mm papule. A radiograph of the left forearm disclosed centromedullary osteolysis and a periosteal reaction of the ulna (Fig. 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a heterogeneous centromedullary lesion in the proximal third of the left ulna generating low signal on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images and enhancing after gadolinium injection; in addition, thickening of the cortex and inflammation of the adjacent soft tissues were seen (Fig. 2 ). A surgical biopsy specimen was composed of fibrous scar tissue with no granuloma or evidence of malignancy. Microbiological studies including tests for mycobacteria were negative. Surgical curettage of the lesion performed in November 2002 recovered pus resembling caseating necrosis. A wild-type S. typhi strain was recovered from cultures of the pus, whereas Loewenstein medium cultures remained negative. Cefotaxime was given for 10 days, followed by oral pefloxacin (400 mg bid) for 3 months. Plasma assays showed pefloxacin levels within the therapeutic range. The clinical course was favorable. At last follow-up 6 months after discontinuation of the antibiotic, she had no evidence of recurrent osteitis.   2.2 Case 2 A 35-year-old woman from Zaire, who was heterozygous for sickle cell disease, was admitted in July 1996 for chronic multifocal osteitis. She reported a stab wound in the left thigh 4 years earlier followed by chronic suppuration. Evaluation of the draining sinus tract led to a diagnosis of osteitis of the middle third of the femur, in October 1994. The radiographic findings suggested chronic osteitis, and there was evidence of moderate inflammation. Foci of osteitis then developed in the humerus, right femur and knee, and left radius. There was no fever or decline in general health. Multiple surgical specimens failed to yield microorganisms; however, S. typhi was found in a single blood culture in April 1995. Surgical curettage was performed at the left femur, humerus, and right knee. Brief courses of oral antibiotics (cefadroxil, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) were consistently followed by relapses. In July 1996, a relapse occurred in the right knee. Histological examination of a pus specimen showed a follicular granulomatous reaction with necrosis. A 1-month trial of antitubercular drug therapy had no effect. The patient was transferred to our department in late July 1996. She was in good general health, with no fever, but had inflammatory pain in all four limbs, a right knee effusion, and a fluid collection in the medial right thigh draining to the skin through a sinus tract. Laboratory tests showed inflammation (ESR, 68 mm/h; and CRP, 56 mg/l) and normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 9.5 g/dl). Serological tests for HIV infection were negative. Radiographs of the femurs and right humerus were suggestive of chronic osteitis, showing osteosclerosis, osteolysis, and a periosteal reaction. A radionuclide bone scan disclosed hot spots in both humeral and femoral shafts and in the right knee. Surgical excision of the sinus tract and bone sequestrum in the right femur was performed in August 1996. Two superficial specimens taken before surgery from the sinus tract and abscess and two deep specimens obtained intraoperatively grew a wild-type S. typhi strain. Ribotyping showed that the organisms recovered from blood in 1995 and the femur in 1996 belonged to the same strain. Following surgery, cefotaxime (12 g/d) and fosfomycin (12 g/d) were given intravenously for 6 weeks, followed by oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg tid) for 4  1 2  months. Plasma ciprofloxacin levels were within the therapeutic range (peak, 3 ?g/ml; and trough, 2 ?g/ml). The course was favorable, and at last follow-up 5 years after antibiotic therapy discontinuation, there was no evidence of a relapse.   2.3 Case 3 This 50-year-old man from Mali was admitted in 8 September 1997, for a fever, a decline in general health, and low back pain. His medical history was unremarkable. He had been living in France for 10 years but had stayed in Mali from February to July 1997. Two weeks before his admission, he started experiencing inflammatory low back pain, abdominal pain, asthenia, and a fever of 38–39 °C without chills. He lost 4 kg over the 2-week period. He denied diarrhea or urinary symptoms. Physical findings at admission consisted of a fever of 38.5 °C, a heart rate of 80/min, and reduced spinal mobility. The L2 and L3 vertebras were painful spontaneously and to palpation, and splinting of the adjacent paraspinal muscles was noted. There was no neurological loss or sphincter dysfunction. Laboratory tests showed moderate inflammation (ESR, 60 mm/h; and CRP, 30 mg/l) with normal blood cell counts and liver function parameters. Radiographs of the lumbar spine disclosed osteolysis on the right side in the lower L2 endplate and loss of L2–L3 disk height on the right (Fig. 3 ). MRI of the spine confirmed the diagnosis of discitis by showing high signal from the lower L2 and upper L3 endplates on T2-weighted images, with postgadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted images (Fig. 4A ). In addition, an image suggestive of a paraspinal abscess extending into the psoas muscle was seen on the right (Fig. 4B). Cultures of a biopsy specimen recovered a wild-type S. typhi strain; tests were negative for mycobacteria, and histology showed nonspecific osteitis. Blood cultures were negative and stool cultures showed no abnormal organisms. An intradermal tuberculin test produced an 11-mm papule. Hemoglobin was normal by electrophoresis, and serological tests for the HIV were negative. Ceftriaxone (2 g/d) intravenously and ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid) orally were started in combination on 18 September. On the fourth treatment day, the patient experienced severe abdominal pain related to necrotic changes about the psoas abscess. The two-drug therapy was continued for 3 weeks, after which the ciprofloxacin was prescribed for six additional weeks. The patient was reevaluated 6 weeks into treatment and found to have normal body temperature and tests for inflammation, with a weight gain of 2 kg. He was subsequently lost to follow-up.  ",0
1062,S2212553115000497,Reaching the underserved: Active tuberculosis case finding in urban slums in southeastern Nigeria," Methods  Study design A prospective, implementation study was carried out in three urban slums in south-east Nigeria from 1 January to 31 December 2012.   Study setting The study sites were three densely populated, low-income urban slum settlements in Abia and Anambra States, south-east Nigeria. Abia and Anambra States have an estimated population of more than 8 million people. In Anambra State, the study was implemented in two urban slums (Okpoko, Aba and Mammy market) with an estimated population of 670,000. The population density in the slums were estimated at 49.78 persons/hectare [19], and are inhabited by poor and lower middle class families. Residential and sanitary conditions are typical of any congested urban settlement. In Abia State, the study was implemented in a slum area regarded as the most densely populated slum in Nigeria, with a projected population of 471,516 [20]. The slum is comprised largely of a heterogeneous group of people, dump-sites and displaced populations, the majority of who are living in unstructured or informal temporary settlements. The slums were selected through purposeful sampling after consultation with the State Ministry of Health and local government area (LGA) authorities.   Target population The target population for the intervention was all individuals utilizing the general outpatient department (GOPD) and HIV clinics in health facilities in the study sites and contacts of TB patients.   Selection of health facilities The study was embedded in the existing health services in the study area. There were 19 healthcare facilities within the study area. These included 3 public and 16 private health facilities. The 3 public health facilities were providing TB services prior to the study and were selected for the study. Also, an additional 9 private health facilities were selected through purposeful sampling after consultation with the State Ministry of Health, LGA authorities and heads of the facilities. Overall, 12 health facilities participated in the study and provided both diagnostic and treatment services.   Intervention Prior to the study, sensitization meetings were held with community leaders, chairs and ministries of local government, directors of Primary Care, and relevant faith-based organizations in the study area and aimed at mobilizing community resources and support for the study. TB messages were disseminated through road shows, market shows and town criers. TB messages were produced in posters, leaflets and jingles, and focused on basic facts about TB and availability of the services. Three key sets of individuals were engaged to work on the project. These included 120 community volunteers (consisting of community members who indicated a willingness to take part in the project), 32 general health workers (who consisted of nurses, community health officers, community health extension workers) and 12 laboratory personnel from the study sites. To enhance the capacity of project staff to effectively participate in the project, the community volunteers (CVs) were given 1-week training on suspect identification and referral, monitoring of TB treatment, and recordkeeping, including completion of data collection tools. The general health workers (GHWs) were offered a one-week training course in TB and HIV services – suspect identification, DOT administration and HIV counseling and testing (HCT) – after which they were provided with data collection tools. Also, a 1-week training course was held for the laboratory staff. In the active case finding, screening of individuals for TB symptoms was carried out by GHWs and CVs using simple, standardized questionnaires. GHWs screened all individuals who visited the general outpatient department (GOPD) and HIV clinics in the selected health facilities for TB symptoms, while trained CVs visited homes of TB patients to screen all available household members for TB symptoms. TB symptoms assessed were cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats and lymph node/spine/bone/abdominal swellings. Individuals with a cough ?2weeks with or without other clinical presentations were identified as pulmonary TB suspects. A productive cough <2weeks with the presence of one or more TB-related symptoms was also considered as inclusion criteria for pulmonary TB. In the case of an absence of cough, if an individual had fever and the presence of one or more TB-related symptoms, TB was suspected. Individuals identified as TB suspects were referred to a TB clinic for further evaluation by a clinician. If no symptoms were reported, no further attempts were made. For the diagnosis of TB among the suspects, those coughing were requested to submit three sputum specimens (spot–morning–spot) at the health facility for microscopy. Trained laboratory staff guided patients on how to produce good quality sputum samples. Diagnosis of TB was made in line with the NTP guidelines [21]. Pulmonary smear-positive was defined as a positive sputum smear confirmed with one or more positive smear. Pulmonary smear-negative was defined by negative smear for AFB with radiology, clinical and/or histology findings consistent with active TB, followed by the decision made by a clinician to treat with a full course of TB chemotherapy. Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) was based on histological or strong clinical evidence consistent with active EPTB, followed by the decision made by a clinician to treat with a full course of TB chemotherapy. HIV counseling and testing was provided to all persons with suspected TB during submission of their sputum for microscopy.  TB treatment, support and care All newly-diagnosed TB patients were started on first-line anti-TB drugs in accordance with the NTP guidelines [21]. The GHWs and CVs followed up on patients who interrupted treatment and encouraged them to commence or complete TB treatment.    Data collection Three trained local government TB supervisors visited the health facilities weekly to supervise and retrieve collected data. Data on all individuals screened for TB were obtained from the screening forms/referral forms, while data on all TB cases found were extracted from the TB treatment cards and TB registers. This included: TB case registration, age, sex, HIV status, smear status, type of TB.   Statistical analysis Data were double-entered into a Microsoft access database by two independent data operators were validated for inconsistencies and were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0. Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics were described in terms of frequencies and percentages. Bivariate analyses were performed with ? 2 test. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.   Ethics approval The Ethics Committee of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria approved the study. Permission was also obtained from the National TB control program, Nigeria and from the respective heads of the study facilities.  ",0
1064,S1473309912701160,Engaging the private sector to increase tuberculosis case detection: an impact evaluation study," Methods  Study design We retrospectively assessed a multifaceted case-detection strategy that targeted private health-care facilities within a section of Karachi, by comparing the number of cases notified to the NTP in the intervention area with the number of cases notified in an adjacent section of Karachi, over a 1 year period. The adjacent geographical area was identified as a suitable control population by the NTP and an independent monitoring and evaluation agency, through the TB REACH initiative. The control area shared several characteristics with the intervention area, including population demographics, income levels, availability of historical data for comparison before and after the intervention, and the absence of any other significant interventions for tuberculosis case detection. Additionally, the geographical proximity of the two sites meant that the frequent political disturbances in the city affected the control area in a similar way.   Setting In 2010, the population of Pakistan was 173·6 million, with Karachi the largest city at 18 million; 16,17  the country ranked 128th on the Human Development Index, with an average per capita income of US$1050. 18,19  In the same year, Pakistan had an estimated annual tuberculosis incidence of 231 per 100?000, a prevalence of 364 per 100?000, and a case-detection rate of 65% (all forms). 1   The estimated 2011 mid-year population was 915?767 in the intervention area (Korangi and a part of Bin Qasim) and 1?213?226 in the control area (Landhi and Shah Faisal). 20  Both areas comprise lower-income households from all major ethnic groups of Pakistan. Annual case-notification data for Karachi from 2008–11 were accessed through the Provincial TB Control Program—Sindh (unpublished). In 2010, 1569 new tuberculosis cases were detected through eight NTP reporting centres in the intervention area (case-notification rate of 176 per 100?000), and 547 cases were detected through five NTP centres in the control area (46 per 100?000). Five of the eight NTP reporting centres in the intervention area are private facilities, including Indus Hospital, a 150-bed centre that provides free care. The hospital's outpatient department has around 300 general visits and 400 specialty clinic visits each day, and the tuberculosis clinic sees around 350 patients daily. Indus Hospital notified 641 susceptible tuberculosis cases to the NTP in 2010 (40·8% of all cases in the intervention area). In addition to three other large (>100 bed) private hospitals, more than 30 small private hospitals and birthing centres and 120 private family clinics were serving the intervention area at baseline.   Procedures To increase uptake of free services for tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment, we implemented a year-long mass communications strategy in the intervention area. We used billboards, cable television advertisements, posters, and flyers to encourage people with 2 or more weeks of productive cough to seek care at one of the family clinics or Indus Hospital, linking messages across all media platforms. Signboards at family clinics advertised free tuberculosis screening and treatment linked to Indus Hospital, and banners were placed at major street junctions near the clinics. Two local cable campaigns in March and October, 2011, included hourly 90–120 s informational videos highlighting the signs and symptoms of tuberculosis and the free diagnostic and treatment services available. 21,22  Self-referrals to Indus Hospital were surveyed about their motivation to come for screening. Local residents in family-clinic catchment areas were invited to apply as screeners. We did brief interviews to assess work experience, oral presentation style, and comfort with using a mobile phone. Candidates had training sessions on NTP guidelines for community health workers on tuberculosis awareness, screening, and treatment, 23  including sputum handling and counselling of patients. Screeners were stationed at 54 geographically dispersed family clinics that reported serving 50 or more patients per day. Screeners at these clinics worked on an incentive-based package, with varying schedules that focused their time at peak clinic hours. Four salaried screeners were stationed at Indus Hospital's outpatient department, from 0730–1600 h Monday–Friday. 12 project monitors (community health workers with at least 5 years of experience) supervised small groups of screeners, managed specimen collection and drug delivery, and ensured every reported tuberculosis case was unique by visiting homes and taking global positioning system coordinates. Patients and their escorts who attended family clinics and the outpatient department were assessed for tuberculosis symptoms by screeners. Screeners used an electronic form on a mobile phone that was linked to conditional cash transfers. Anyone with a cough of 3 weeks or more in duration (or 2–3 weeks of productive cough), a previous history of tuberculosis, or a family member currently diagnosed with the disease were suspected to have tuberculosis (figure 1 ). Individuals who came directly to Indus Hospital's tuberculosis clinic without first being screened at a family clinic or the outpatient department (self-referrals) and those suspected of having the disease who were referred to the tuberculosis clinic from other clinics at Indus Hospital or from outside facilities (referrals) are reported separately (table ). Patients suspected of having tuberculosis were requested to provide a spot sputum and an early morning sputum specimen. All laboratory testing was done at Indus Hospital in compliance with the National Reference Laboratory's external quality-assurance process for sputum microscopy. Monitors collected sputum containers from family clinics and transported them to Indus Hospital, recording collection and submission times on their mobile phones. Sputum test results were reported as text messages to family doctors and patients. A chest radiograph was requested for all patients suspected of having tuberculosis with negative smear results, and DNA testing (GeneXpert mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin [MTB/RIF] assay, Cepheid, Toulouse, France) was done for 388 in whom radiographs suggested tuberculosis. All patients with suspected tuberculosis who were younger than 15 years, those with negative smear results but suggestive radiograph, and those suspected of having extrapulmonary disease were referred to Indus Hospital for diagnosis by specialists. Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed if a patient had at least one positive acid-fast bacilli smear result, a positive MTB/RIF assay, or a chest radiograph suggestive of tuberculosis and clinical signs and symptoms as diagnosed by a specialist or family doctor. A single radiologist read all chest radiographs. Individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis were offered free treatment and all cases were notified to the NTP through Indus Hospital. Screeners at family clinics received a monthly stipend of $23·50 (exchange rate $1=PKR 85), plus cash incentives for submitting a daily phone report ($0·18), procuring an acceptable sputum sample ($0·88), and identifying a smear-positive case ($11·80) or other form of tuberculosis ($5·88). Additional incentives were provided for treatment initiation ($1·76) and follow-up visits ($0·58). Screeners at Indus Hospital's outpatient department received a fixed monthly salary ranging from $82·4–115·3. Two software programmers who custom designed the mobile phone software used by screeners to collect, submit, and retrieve data continued to improve performance and expand functionality throughout the year. The system operates on any Java-enabled phone with general packet radio service (GPRS) capability. We used Nokia 2710, Nokia 6700, and Nokia X2-05 phones. The system allowed data entry and retrieval to a central database at the time of screening, identification of patients suspected of having tuberculosis via an interactive algorithm (figure 1), and scheduling of sputum collection, treatment initiation, clinic visits, and drug dispersal. Screeners were required to attempt three phone calls and two home visits to patients who were identified as cases but never initiated treatment—ie, those about to default. Personal details—including name, address, phone number, and national identification card number (for adults)—were recorded in compliance with NTP requirements for preventing double counting or fraudulent case reporting, to permit mapping of patients to intervention or control areas and facilitate defaulter tracing. The system required a username and password for role-based access to forms and patient data. Submitted forms generated an electronic trail that allowed monitoring and ranking of screener performance and dispersal of financial incentives. The software code will be freely available under an open-source licence by November, 2012. The institutional review board at Interactive Research and Development approved the study. Patients suspected of having tuberculosis were required to provide verbal consent and could refuse screening and treatment at any time. All screening, diagnostic, and treatment algorithms were in accordance with NTP guidelines and were approved by the NTP at the start of the project.   Statistical analysis We measured the overall effect of the intervention strategy by comparing the percentage change in case notifications by NTP reporting centres (2011 relative to 2010), and in annual case-notification rates (2011 relative to 2008–2010) in the intervention versus control areas. By use of Poisson regression analysis for count data, we calculated the overall difference between the change in case notifications in the intervention area and the change in case notifications in the control area from 2010 to 2011. We used negative binomial regression for overdispersed count data to examine the association between the number of cases notified per quarter from 2008–11 at Indus Hospital, the intervention area (excluding Indus Hospital), and the control area, before and after the start of the intervention. A partial linear model using splines with knots at quarter 1, 2011, was used to assess the effect of the intervention on quarterly case-notification rates for these three groups. We used one-way ANOVA to compare mean age, a ?2 test for homogeneity of proportions across sites (ie, family clinics and Indus Hospital's outpatient department, tuberculosis clinic self-referrals, and tuberculosis clinic referrals), and a non-parametric test for trends to identify changes over time within a site. Analysis was done with Stata/IC, version 11.   Role of the funding source This study was funded by the TB REACH initiative of the Stop TB Partnership. The sponsor had no role in the study design or data collection. The sponsor was involved in monitoring overall project performance through quarterly reports. A member of the TB REACH secretariat (JC) was involved in the data analysis, interpretation, and writing the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.  ",0
1073,S0163445308002934,Alcohol use and clinical manifestations of tuberculosis," Methods This was a retrospective study of all adult (>14 years old) cases of tuberculosis reported to the North Carolina Tuberculosis Control Program between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2006. In North Carolina, data from confirmed cases of tuberculosis are routinely recorded by county public health nurses and entered into a central database. Available data elements include the following: demographics (gender, race/ethnicity, age group); occupation (healthcare worker, correctional facility, migrant worker, other, not employed); year of tuberculosis report; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status; homelessness during the previous year; residence in a correctional facility or in a long term care facility; excess alcohol use (yes/no/unknown); injection or non-injection illicit drug use (yes/no/unknown); disease site (pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or both); method of tuberculosis medication administration (self-administered or directly observed therapy); tuberculosis drug resistance (yes/no/unknown); disease verification criteria; history of previous tuberculosis; vital status; and whether tuberculosis treatment was completed. The database also includes clinical information including results of sputum smear and culture, tuberculin skin test results at diagnosis, chest radiograph results, the initial tuberculosis treatment regimen, and the reason for stopping therapy (successful completion, death, lost to follow-up). Although excess alcohol use is not defined quantitatively, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide general guidelines for public health staff to use when making this assessment. Suggested criteria for classifying tuberculosis cases as having excess alcohol use in the previous 12 months include evidence of participation in an alcohol treatment program, documented medical conditions associated with excess alcohol use (e.g. cirrhosis, pancreatitis), or a diagnosis of alcoholism in medical records. 5  Overall, 192 tuberculosis cases, or 3.5% of the study population, had missing status for alcohol use. The proportion of tuberculosis cases with missing status for alcohol use declined from 9.7% in 1994 to 0.6% in 2006. For purposes of this analysis, subjects with missing or “unknown” status for alcohol use were grouped with persons who did not use excess alcohol. An anonymised database including all cases reported from 1994 to 2006 was provided to the authors for analysis. The study protocol was approved by the North Carolina State Institutional Review Board and the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.  Statistical methods Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to describe bivariate associations between excess alcohol use and categorical independent variables. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess time trends. Because excess alcohol use was prevalent in our population, odds ratios would not accurately reflect the magnitude of risk associated with specific risk factors. 6  Log binomial modeling was therefore performed with SAS PROC GENMOD to estimate prevalence ratios for risk factors associated with excess alcohol use and with potentially more infectious (pulmonary, smear-positive, and cavitary) clinical manifestations of tuberculosis. 7  Unless otherwise specified, subjects with missing data for a given variable were excluded from multivariable models that included that variable. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  ",0
1080,S0953620599000412,Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis mimicking tuberculosis: a case report," 2 Case report A 36-year-old male from Surinam was referred to the outpatient clinic with a 4-month history of worsening nonproductive cough, night sweats, and an 8-kg weight loss. His past medical history revealed only a community-acquired pneumonia 4 years earlier, for which no specialist consultation was indicated. No family history of lung diseases was mentioned. The patient had been working as an office clerk since his immigration to the Netherlands 15 years earlier. He denied regular smoking habits and had no pet animals in his household. On physical examination, the patient appeared in good physical condition, without fever or abnormal clinical symptoms. Blood pressure was 135/80 mm Hg. A normal breathing rhythm was observed, with a resonant percussion and normal vesicular breath sounds. The extremities did not show cyanosis or clubbing and the skin appeared without lesions. Neurological examination was also normal. Laboratory findings showed a slight elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 16 mm/h, C-reactive protein 16 mg/l, a white blood cell count of 5.7?109/l. Eosinophilia was not found. Hemoglobin was 9.2 mmol/l, hematocrit 0.46%, mean corpuscular volume 87 fl, platelets 277?109/l. On serum electrophoresis, albumin was 36 g/l, alpha-1 globulin 2.9 g/l, alpha-2 globulin 8.7 g/l, beta globulin 7.4 g/l and gamma globulin 11.9 g/l. Serum calcium was 2.45 mmol/l, creatine 90 ?mol/l. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) concentration was increased at 196 U/l. The presence of ANCA or anti-DNA antibodies was not determined. Chest radiography (Fig. 1 a) showed an enlarged mediastinum, with bihilar lymphadenopathy and an increased interstitial and small nodular pattern in the lower lung field. A CT-scan confirmed the presence of lymphadenopathies in the mediastinum and the hilar regions. Pulmonary function tests showed no parenchymal alteration, FEV1=2700 ml (64% predicted), VC=4080 (76.6% predicted), TLC=6000 ml (82% predicted), and FEV1/VCmax=82%, compatible with combined slightly obstructive and restrictive lung disorder. A bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies were performed. Endobronchial abnormalities were not found. Acid stain rods were not observed in the BAL fluid. Material for culture of mycobacteria was taken. Histopathological analysis of the biopsies revealed the presence of lung tissue with chronic, granulomatous inflammation containing polynuclear giant cells of the Langhans type and foreign body (Fig. 2 a). Little central fibrinoid necrosis was observed and neither asteroid nor Schaumann bodies were present. Halberg staining appeared negative and no acid-fast bacilli were observed. At this point, the differential diagnosis included tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or pulmonary vasculitis. In view of the clinico-radiological features, the patient's ethnic background, and the initial histopathological findings, a diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis was made. The patient was treated with the following daily regimen against tuberculosis: 300 mg isoniazide, 600 mg rifampicin, 2000 mg pyrazinamide and 1600 mg ethambutol for a period of 8 months. Chest X-rays were repeated twice monthly during follow-up. No significant changes were observed until the 8th month of treatment by which time mediastinal and bihilar lymphadenopathies had progressively increased and diffuse reticulonodular opacities, compatible with miliair tuberculosis were seen (Fig. 1b). Bronchoscopy was repeated. Again, histopathological examination showed epithelioid cell granuloma with extensive central necrosis and pronounced fibrosis (Fig. 2b). However, the results of the first BAL cell culture appeared to be negative for mycobacteria; therefore, an infection by (atypical) mycobacteria was ruled out. After reviewing the patient's history, chest X-rays, and endobronchial biopsies, the diagnosis was changed to pulmonary vasculitis with extensive necrosis. The patient was treated with prednisone 30 mg/day. Within 6 weeks, a remarkable improvement in the roentgenological abnormalities was achieved (Fig. 1c). The rapid clinical response led to the final diagnosis of NSG. ",0

1087,S0188440915000120,Diabetes and Other Risk Factors for Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis in a Mexican Population with Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Case Control Study," Materials and Methods As of 1998, all patients with suspected MDR-TB in the state of San Luis Potosí (SLP) (total population 2,585,518 inhabitants according to the 2010 census) are referred to a multidisciplinary group for assessment, treatment, and follow-up (State Committee for MDR-TB). For this study, data from all cases ?18 years of age with confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB evaluated from 1998–2013 by this committee was analyzed (n = 36). Patient assessment included a careful past treatment history obtained by a standardized protocol, sputum culture for mycobacteria, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and drug susceptibility test for first line anti-tuberculosis drugs. HIV and general laboratory tests are performed in all MDR-TB cases as part of the initial evaluation. Drug susceptibility testing was done by the proportion method. All strains were tested at the Laboratorio Estatal de Salud Pública, a regional certified laboratory, for susceptibility to four first-line drugs as a policy of the Mexican Ministry of Health: the medium used was modified Middle-Brook 7H9–7H10-BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 (30,31) and tests performed were for isoniazid (0.2 ?g/mL), rifampin (2.0 ?g/mL), streptomycin (4.0 ?g/mL) and ethambutol (5.0 ?g/mL). Resistance was defined as the growth of >1% of the colonies in drug-containing media compared with the growth in a drug-free (control) medium. All patients classified as MDR-TB had a positive culture and positive PCR test for M. tuberculosis as well as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin. In addition, 60% of samples from MDR-TB cases were also processed at the Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos (InDRE), a supranational laboratory for quality control that used Middlebrook 7H10- BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 (30,31). As a comparison group, we included information from patients treated in SLP for pulmonary TB during a 6-year period under programmatic conditions. For this group, 139 patients were randomly selected from all patients reported to the TB program in SLP between years 2003 and 2008 with sputum samples in which acid-fast bacilli were identified by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, with clinical-radiographic data compatible with the diagnosis of pulmonary TB and in whom resistance to rifampin and MDR-TB were excluded (non-MDR-TB). In Mexico it is not a standard practice to perform culture and drug susceptibility tests to all recently diagnosed cases of TB. The control population was selected from patients treated from 2003–2008 because during this time period all pulmonary TB cases from SLP had drug susceptibility testing performed prior to first treatment as part of a project to determine primary MDR-TB frequency. All control subjects had sputum samples collected and M. tuberculosis was confirmed by culture and PCR; all controls were treated and followed according to WHO and Mexican guidelines (14,15). All clinical, laboratory, and treatment outcomes were obtained from patient files and the state TB database (former EPI-TB, since 2007 Plataforma Unica de Información), which has been used since 1995 in the National Program for Tuberculosis Control in Mexico. Definitions of outcomes including death were according to WHO (32), except default for which the definition of Norma Oficial Mexicana was used (15). Data from MDR-TB cases as well as the comparison group were collected in standard forms including demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and TB treatment-related variables. For all patients, DM cases were confirmed by two fasting serum glucose determinations (>126 mg/dL/>70 mmol/L) and/or at least two abnormal glycosylated hemoglobin measurements (>7%); these data were supported by confirmation of the diagnosis of DM by the patient during follow-up and/or regular oral intake of a sulfonylurea. In the MDR-TB group, patients with DM were treated and followed-up by endocrinology specialists. To determine death rates in both groups, the national death certificate database of the Ministry of Health was consulted. Results were updated until October 2013. Initially we aimed to include four controls per subject (1:4 case/control ratio). Taking into account the observation of a high DM prevalence in MDR-TB patients from a preliminary analysis (40%) and the reported prevalence of DM in the Mexican population (9.2%), this would provide >95% power to detect a significant difference between both study groups with 95% confidence (29,33,34). In a subsequent analysis, taking into account the actual DM prevalence in the final study population, we obtained a 58.6% power to detect differences with 95% confidence. Patients' characteristics between pulmonary non-MDR-TB and pulmonary MDR-TB subjects were analyzed. Continuous variables were compared using Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test according to data distribution. Categorical variables were compared using the ?2 or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS for Windows, version 14.0 and OpenEpi (35). A p value <0.05 was considered as significant. This study consisted of the review of existing databases and did not include any intervention. The study was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee at Servicios de Salud del Estado de San Luis Potosí. ",0
1100,S2213007113000154,"Multidetector computed tomography findings of central bronchopleural fistulas as sequelae of tuberculosis, chemo radiation and trauma: A report of three cases"," 2 Case reports  2.1 Case 1 A 72-year-old male farmer had been suffering with a cough, hemoptysis, sputum, fever, dyspnea, weakness, and chest pain for 20 days. His medical history indicated that he had been diagnosed with a pulmonary tuberculosis infection 40 years earlier. Furthermore, the patient had relapsed 30 years after the first infection and taken antituberculosis drugs. On clinical examination crackles and reduced breathing sounds in the right hemithorax were detected. Chest radiography showed volume loss, pleural thickening, and a hydropneumothorax on the right side. Also, a mediastinal shift to the right was apparent (Fig. 1 ). Computed tomography scans were performed with the patients in the dorsal decubitus position during maximum inspiration, and an eight-channel MDCT system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used. Contiguous axial slices with contrast-enhanced CT scans were undertaken at 5 mm intervals with 5 mm collimation at an automatically modulated amperage of 120 Kvp (120–225 mA). All images were obtained at window levels appropriate for the lung parenchyma (window width, 1500–1700 HU; window level, ?600 or ?700 HU) and mediastinum (window width, 250–400 HU; window level, 40–50 HU). The images were then reconstructed with a high resolution algorithm, and the multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images were interpreted in various planes. The MDCT revealed a collapsed right upper lobe with a mediastinal shift and air-fluid levels. A BPF was visualized in the right upper lobe bronchus on axial, coronal, and oblique coronal MPR images (Figs. 2 and 3  ). Pleural thickening, calcifications, and enhancement after the administration of contrast material with fluid collection were indicators of empyema (Fig. 4 (a)). In addition, a cavitary lesion was present at the superior segment of the right lower lobe (Fig. 4(b)). Peribronchial thickening and cylindrical bronchiectasis in both lungs were detected along with fibrotic changes in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe. The volume of the left lung was increased, and its density was reduced due to air-trapping (Fig. 4(b)). Sputum samples were collected from the patients, and sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were obtained as well; however, the samples and cultures were negative. Despite no bacteriological evidence of tuberculosis, the BPF was attributed to chronic inflammation due to tuberculosis and possible tuberculous pleuritis that had been occurring for years. Administration of empirical antibiotics and a mucolytic resolved the patient's symptoms, and he was discharged from the hospital. At the three-month clinical follow-up, his respiratory symptoms had regressed, and chest radiography revealed that the hydropneumothorax and increased volume of the right hemithorax (Fig. 5 ).   2.2 Case 2 A 62-year-old man was admitted to the oncology department with left chest pain and dyspnea. His past medical history revealed that he had been hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and been diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) five months prior to admission. A large irregular mass measuring 98 × 63 mm in diameter and enlarged lymphadenopathies of approximately 28 mm in diameter had been found on the left side of the mediastinum via CT at the time of diagnosis. A fiberoptic bronchoscopy had also revealed a mass at the left upper lobe bronchus, and SCLC was diagnosed at the pathological examination of the endobronchial mass. No distant metastasis was revealed via bone scintigraphy or brain and abdominal imaging. The disease was accepted as limited-stage SCLC, and two courses of cisplatin and etoposid were given concomitantly with radiation therapy. After completion, a third course of the same chemotherapy regimen was administered. The physical examination showed fine crackles on inspiration at the left hemithorax and the breathing sounds were decreased in the left lung. The white blood cell (WBC) count was 10.9 × 109 (neutrophils, 80.9%), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 120 mm/h, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 205 mg/dL. Chest radiography revealed a loss of volume in the left hemithorax with a mass lesion at the left hilum and an area of consolidation at the left upper and middle zones. There were also alveolar opacities and peribronchovascular thickening on both lungs (Fig. 6 (a)). By offering the best supportive care and providing an empirical wide spectrum of antibiotics for pneumonia, the symptoms were resolved, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. However, seven days later, he presented with dyspnea and fever, and chest radiography revealed a collapsed left upper lobe and a pneumothorax on the left side. Segmental and nodular pulmonary infiltrations along with air-fluid levels and pleural thickening were also observed (Fig. 6(b)). Chest MDCT confirmed the collapsed left upper lobe with air-fluid levels and revealed a mass lesion at the upper lobe bronchus. A BPF in the left upper lobe bronchus was also detected (Fig. 7 ). Furthermore, pleural thickening with enhancement and effusion were present at the left hemithorax. The area of consolidation (Fig. 7) at the left lung and a cavitary lesion at the superior segment of the left lower lobe were also observed. Additionally, nodular areas of ground glass opacity, cylindrical bronchiectasis with peribronchial thickening, and pleural effusion were identified at the left hemithorax (Fig. 8 ). The cause of the BPF was accepted as necrotizing pneumonia due to the radiation therapy. The patient refused the insertion of a thorax tube for pleural drainage. Ten days later, he was admitted to the emergency department with mental confusion and respiratory failure. He also had a fever and purulent sputum. The patient was uncooperative and disoriented, and auscultation showed crackles on both hemithoraces. Therefore, he was immediately admitted to the ICU. Despite oxygen inhalation, the use of bronchodilatators, and antibiotic therapy, his clinical course worsened. Cardiopulmonary arrest developed, and the patient died from respiratory failure 12 h after he was taken to the ICU.   2.3 Case 3 A 16-year-old female patient with an unremarkable medical history was admitted to our emergency department after a fall from three meters. She was conscious, alert, and hemodynamically stable but complained of pain with movement and 4/5 muscle strength in the lower extremities. Auscultation of the lungs showed decreased respiratory sounds at the right hemithorax. Head, spine, and chest MDCT examinations and an abdominal ultrasound examination were done. The head MDCT revealed a subdural hematoma 1 cm in thickness located approximately at the convexity level with no mass effect on the left side and a contusion approximately 2 mm in diameter at the left frontal lobe. There were multiple unstable fractures on the third and fourth vertebrae with compression of the spinal cord. Multiple fracture lines at the spinous and transverse processes, and the laminae of these vertebrae were also observed. In addition, there were hematomas on the right-sided psoas muscle and paravertebral muscles. A chest MDCT examination revealed diffuse, patchy airspace opacities, multiple traumatic hemopneumatoceles with air-fluid levels at the right lower lobe, and a BPF at the right lower lobe bronchus on more than one contiguous slice (Fig. 9 ). Moreover, a hemopneumothorax with air-fluid levels was detected on the CT scan. The radiological findings were attributed to the type I pulmonary laceration and the formation of a traumatic pneumatocele along with the BPF. The patient then underwent urgent surgery for the stabilization of the lumbar vertebrae fractures and spinal decompression, but the lung laceration and BPF were treated conservatively without any surgical intervention.

1107,S1201971208014094,Rapid diagnosis and successful drug therapy of primary parotid tuberculosis in the pediatric age group: a case report and brief review of the literature," The case A 13-year-old female presented to the Neuro-otorhinolaryngology Department of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow with a history of slowly growing swelling of the right parotid gland, low grade fever, mild pain, and gradually increasing difficulty in opening the mouth over a 3-month period. She had received multiple courses of antibiotics, which did not effect any improvement. She had no present or past history suggestive of tuberculosis. Ten years previously her father had received drug therapy for cervical lymph node tuberculosis. She had a non-tender, circumscribed, solitary, 6×4cm size swelling of the right parotid region. The swelling was firm and non-tender with ill-defined borders. The skin over the swelling was intact and the temperature was not raised. Clinical signs of facial nerve palsy were present. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. The rest of the head and neck examination was normal. A BCG vaccine scar was present. The hematological and biochemical profile was normal. Chest X-ray did not show any abnormality. A contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan of head and neck region showed a 5×4×3.6cm mass lesion with areas of fluid density, completely replacing the right parotid. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the most prominent part of the swelling yielded purulent material. A smear stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed caseous necrosis and degenerated mixed inflammatory cells. A Gram stain did not show any organism. A smear stained by Ziehl–Neelsen technique 3  showed no acid-fast bacilli (AFB).  Microbiology Thick pus (2ml) was aspirated. Two smears were made: one direct smear was prepared from the unprocessed specimen and the other was from a processed specimen (0.5ml of aspirated pus was mixed with 1ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5min at 3000rpm). Both the smears were stained by Ziehl–Neelsen technique 3 and were examined for AFB. The unprocessed specimen showed two AFB in the entire smear. The processed specimen showed 1–2bacilli/10 oil immersion fields.   Molecular methods DNA extraction 4  was done from the aspirated pus. Differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was done by PCR amplification using the IS6110 gene 4  (Figure 1 , inset).   Culture Aspirated pus was cultured on conventional Lowenstein–Jensen (LJ) slants 3  and in the radiometric BACTEC 460 TB system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, USA). 5  The slant was incubated at 37°C and inspected weekly for any growth. BACTEC culture showed growth of AFB after 10 days of incubation, whereas conventional culture was positive after 3 weeks of incubation. The culture isolate from LJ and BACTEC media was identified as M. tuberculosis complex by p-nitro-?-acetylamine-?-hydroxypropiophenone(NAP) 5?g disc (radiometric BACTEC 460 TB system identification method). 5  Susceptibility testing to four first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and streptomycin) was done. 5  The isolate was sensitive to all four drugs.   Treatment The patient was treated with World Health Organization (WHO) approved directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) category III regimen under the Revised National Tuberculosis Programme. 6     Follow-up The swelling and fever had subsided by 6 months. She was able to open her mouth to near normal status. Her appetite was normal and she had gained 7kg in weight. There was no evidence of disease at the end of one year.  ",0
1128,S000342661501077X,Thyroid tuberculosis: A new case and review of the literature," 2 Patient A 32-year-old male presented with a weight loss and a persistent cough over the previous few months. The patient was from Thailand and his family history was significant for tuberculosis in the parents, a brother, an aunt and his grandmother. His physical examination was unremarkable but a tuberculin skin test was positive (20mm). The chest computed tomography showed pulmonary nodes suggestive of miliary and cervicothoracic nodes. Gram stains on an expectoration were negative. A rapid PCR assay MTB/RIF GeneXpert® (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) on the expectoration was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Bacteriological cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antibiotic testing by PCR revealed sensitivity to rifampicin and isoniazid. The patient was started on triple-therapy comprising rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamid. Ethambutol treatment was not prescribed because the familial Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain was susceptible to the first line drugs. After 3-week treatment, the patient still suffered from an unproductive, dry cough without fever. He reported painful symptoms in his anterior cervical area. The clinical examination revealed a right intern sub-clavicular adenopathy and a painful hyperplasia of the right thyroid lobe. Laboratory testing showed hyperleucocytosis (10.7 G/L), with an increase of neutrophil polynuclear, elevated C-reactive protein (24mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (30mm at first hour). Serum TSH was 0.49 mU/L (normal range 0.3–4.2 mU/L). A chest X-ray showed apical segmentar atelectasia related to hypertrophy of the right inter-tracheobronchial node. Cervical ultrasound examination showed a 14×17×19mm cystic nodule of the right thyroid lobe and necrotic right cervical nodes. The contours were irregular, infiltrating the surrounding thyroid tissue. Echostructure was hypoechogenous without any vascular Doppler signal and no calcification (Fig. 1 ). Cytology examination on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) revealed necrosis and inflammation, with infiltration of neutrophil polynuclears and macrophages. The specimen did not show acid-fast bacilli (AFB) at microscopy. All standard bacteriological cultures were sterile. On the aspirated nodule, a Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific geneXpert RT-PCR assay was performed and showed a positive result confirming the thyroid tuberculosis. No resistance to rifampicin was detected by PCR assay. After 3 months of the triple-therapy regimen, the treatment was simplified to a bitherapy regimen of rifampicin and isoniazid for 6 months. Clinical monitoring showed a significant reduction of all initial symptoms. ",0
1139,S2210909914001246,Trends and Characteristics of HIV Infection among Suspected Tuberculosis Cases in Public Health Centers in Korea: 2001–2013," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study participants and data collection Study subjects were suspected TB cases that visited PHCs and agreed to take HIV tests. Among suspected TB cases, if doctors decided to offer HIV tests, the HIV tests were only conducted with the patient's agreement [12]. PHCs managed the test data with a computerized data processing system known as the Health Care Information System (HCIS). This system began to be installed in PHCs in 2000, and installation was completed in all PHCs in 2005. HIV test data were converted from the HCIS into Excel format and reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Before the installation of the HCIS, only the number of HIV tests were manually recorded and collected. The variables collected in KCDC consist of specimen code, gender, year of birth, the reason for HIV testing, test results, institution of first diagnosis, number of tests code, and confirmatory test code. In this study, we collected all data of suspected TB cases with an HIV test result available in KCDC.   2.2 National HIV testing system PHCs used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), particle agglutination (PA), and rapid tests for HIV screening; if positive in PHCs, the specimen was sent to Provincial Institutes for Health and Environment (PIHEs) for confirmatory testing. A total of 17 PIHEs confirm HIV positive specimen with ELISA, antigen ELISA, PA, and western blot tests. If PIHEs had difficulty in confirming HIV infection, the specimen was sent to the division of AIDS at the KCDC for confirmatory testing. If HIV infection was confirmed, the test results were reported to the division of HIV and TB control at the KCDC and registered as an HIV infection [14].   2.3 Statistical analysis Annual HIV seroprevalence at PHCs was defined as the number of confirmed HIV-infected individuals per 10,000 HIV-tested persons among suspected TB cases at PHCs each year. Trends in HIV seroprevalence were assessed through a series of cross-sectional annual analyses. The testing frequency of each individual in a single year is referred to as the repeated number. We analyzed suspected TB cases and HIV-infected individuals among them at PHCs by gender, age (<20, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, ?60), nationality (Korean, foreigner) and region (metropolis, smaller city or rural area).

There were no other systemic symptoms and no medical history of note. A complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were within normal limits. Routine urine analysis was normal. Testicular tumor markers including ?-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, and ?-human chorionic gonadotropin were normal. During physical examination, urologist found a tender mass within the left testis. Ultrasonography (US) of the scrotum was then performed, showing a correct size of both testes with 2 hypoechoic polycyclic nodules (diameter, 12 and 16 mm) in the area of the left epididymis. It was suggested to remove the left epididymis and to examine it histopathologically. Finally, the resection was not performed. The patient was treated with a course of ciprofloxacin (2 × 500 mg every 24 h for 10 days) and then with cotrimoxazole (480 mg bid for 10 days) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs with significant clinical improvement. He returned approximately 8 weeks later complaining of swelling and increased discomfort during ejaculation and blood in semen. A follow-up US examination was performed, showing nodular hypoechoic heterogeneous enlargement with focal slight calcifications and granulomatous inflammatory process of the tail of epididymis (Figs. 1 and 2  ). Color Doppler US demonstrated a higher degree of blood flow in the peripheral portion of the affected epididymis, which is suggestive of inflammation process. It was decided to test the patient for TB. To rule out pulmonary spread of the disease, we performed chest X-ray and the following microbiologic investigations: acid-fast bacilli (AFB), culture on the Löwenstein–Jensen (L-J) slants, and BBL MIGIT (Becton Dickinson, Warsaw, Poland), liquid medium of 3 subsequent sputum samples. The presence of M. tuberculosis in specimens from genitourinary tract, urine and semen, was verified using conventional methods such as AFB, culture on L-J, and BBL MIGIT, as well as INNO-LiPA Rif TB nested PCR (checked by the Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics, Glasgow 2002). The negative results of tested sputum and urine samples indicated no lung or renal involvement. Direct semen samples examination gave positive results only by nested PCR performed with adequate controls for each sample batch (negative with TE buffer -10mM Tris-Cl, ph 7.5 + 1mM EDTA, positive with reference strain H37Rv, inhibition positive control) (Table 1 ). The line probe assay revealed that the isolate was sensitive to rifampicin. The Mantoux test with the induration of 13 mm (<15 mm) was recognized as negative because the patient presented no risk factors for TB and because of the previous BCG vaccination (Cek et al., 2005). QFT IT performed 2 times within a month gave positive results (5.98 and 5.06 U/mL). Because of clinical and microbiologic findings, the patient was diagnosed with tuberculous epididymo-orchitis. Chemotherapy with antituberculous drugs was immediately initiated according to World Health Organization recommendations (overview in Cek et al., 2005; Treatment of Tuberculosis, 2003). The treatment was based on an initial 2-month intensive phase with 3 drugs daily: rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide. This was followed by a 4-month continuation phase with rifamazide, which is the combination of isoniazid and rifampicin. The patient clinically recovered, and US revealed significant improvement after the therapy. A repeated PCR from semen sample gave negative result. ",0
1166,S1871404811000827,Pediatric laryngeal tuberculosis: A case with significant diagnostic challenges," 2 Case report A 10year-old girl with Trisomy 21 living in Napa, California presented to an urgent care clinic with a 1-month history of hoarseness. Symptoms had developed over a period of 1–2days, with no precedent illness. Social history was notable for birth in California, with annual trips to Mexico for 2–3weeks at a time. Her only exam finding was hoarseness. She was discharged to home with supportive care instructions and a plan to return to the Head and Neck Surgery (HNS) clinic if symptoms persisted. One month later, she was seen by HNS. Her hoarseness had persisted for 2months. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL) revealed an edematous right vocal cord and extensive wart-like growths on the epiglottis and anterior false vocal folds clinically consistent with laryngeal papillomata (Fig. 1 ). There was no history of recent viral illness and her mother denied any genitourinary condylomata. The patient was taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy with microdebridement of suspected papilloma. No tracheal or bronchial lesions were noted. Biopsies were obtained and post operatively the laryngeal exam was improved. Histopathology revealed suppurative granulomatous inflammation without papilloma. Microscopically, multiple scattered granulomas with areas of central or adjacent suppurative necrosis were noted. Acid fast bacteria and fungal stains were negative on the specimen. No evidence of vasculitis was seen. Further investigation included CBC, ESR, VDRL, Bartonella henselae IgM and IgG, Brucella IgM and IgG, chest X-ray and tuberculin skin test (TST) placement. All testing was negative, aside from a positive Bartonella IgG. TST was placed a total of 3 times during the time course of this case, all with 0mm induration. One month follow up revealed resolution of hoarseness and FLL exam showed improved laryngeal exam without return of granuloma. The patient remained asymptomatic for a period of approximately 7months after initial follow up before she returned with hoarseness. Over the next 10months, the patient was seen multiple times for recurrent cough by HNS and again underwent direct laryngoscopy with debridement. Each procedure was followed by near resolution of symptoms, only to have her cough and hoarseness return 1–2months after debridement and course of oral steroids. Biopsies again showed suppurative noncaseating granulomas with no acid-fast or fungal elements identified. Pulmonary and Rheumatology services were consulted. Chest and neck computed tomographies (CT) were obtained, revealing severe laryngeal stenosis (Fig. 2 ), mediastinal lymphadenopathy, airspace opacities, and segmental infiltrate in the left upper lobe. Extensive serologic studies to identify potential causes of laryngeal stenosis (collagen vascular disease, sarcoidosis, etc.) were all normal. Because of the negative work up for tuberculosis, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was strongly considered because of her compatible clinical picture, the histologic evidence of noncaseating granulomas, and exclusion of other conditions with similar histologic or clinical features (multiple negative studies for TB). With the presumptive diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the patient was started on prednisone with dramatic improvement of cough and mild improvement in her hoarseness. Two years after her initial presentation, the patient was seen in clinic for increased stridor and work of breathing while still on oral steroids. She was admitted to the hospital and underwent a direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and tracheostomy. During the tracheotomy an enlarged pretracheal lymph node was encountered and biopsied. In addition, a brochioalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and cultures obtained. Candida albicans initially grew from the BAL. The infectious disease service was consulted, who felt infectious etiology was unlikely and that the clinical presentation remained consistent with sarcoidosis. Fluconazole was empirically started based on the candida growth. The lymph node specimen revealed acid fast bacteria and granulomatous lymphadenitis. Nine days after BAL, the microbiology lab reported that while the AFB stains were negative, AFB culture was now growing bacilli in broth. Subsequent tracheostomy tube aspirates also returned AFB stain positive. The AFB culture was later confirmed to be M. tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculoid therapy was initiated promptly. ",0
1194,S0278239117311904,"A Rare, Unusual Presentation of Primary Tuberculosis in the Temporomandibular Joint"," Report of Case A 49-year-old woman presented to the authors' hospital with the main complaint of swelling in front of the left tragus. The patient said she had noticed it 3 months previously, when it was 5 × 5 mm. It gradually increased to 3 × 3 cm. The swelling was associated with pain, which was continuous, throbbing, and severe in intensity and radiated to the temporal region. The patient also noticed a gradual decrease in her mouth opening in the past 3 months. The patient visited an otolaryngologist and a local dentist who had put her on a course of antibiotics and analgesics. She was relieved of pain but swelling did not subside. When no improvements were seen in the symptoms, the patient was referred to the authors' hospital for further management. On examination, a 3- × 3-cm round swelling was noticed in front of the left tragus, which was mobile, firm in consistency, and tender. The skin over the swelling was normal (Fig 1 ). Her mouth opening was 21 mm. On opening, a deviation of the mandible to the left side was noticed. The condylar movements were palpable on the 2 sides during protrusive and lateral excursive movements. Any history of trauma was ruled out. A bilateral ear examination was performed, with no notable findings. An orthopantomogram showed a decrease in the TMJ space on the left side (Fig 2 ). The patient underwent computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. CT scans depicted destruction of the left mandibular condyle with proximal sclerosis and erosion of the mandibular fossa (Fig 3 ). MRI scans displayed a well-defined collection around the condylar head and neck that extended to the masseter and lateral pterygoid muscles and TMJ space with destruction of the left mandibular condyle and erosion of the mandibular fossa (Fig 4 ). All routine blood results were within normal limits. The patient was seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus. A differential diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis of the left mandibular condyle or tubercular abscess of the left TMJ was made. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the lesion under general anesthesia. Through the preauricular and retromandibular approach, the joint was exposed, and the collection over the mandibular condyle and erosion of the condylar head were visualized. Therefore, a condylectomy and curettage of the joint space were performed (Fig 5 ). The excised lesion was subjected to histopathologic examination (Fig 6 ). The specimen showed numerous epithelioid granulomas with caseation and giant cells. The bony specimen showed bony trabeculae and marrow spaces with granulomas and focal necrosis and giant cells. The features were suggestive of a caseating granulomatous inflammatory lesion and osteomyelitis in favor of TB (Fig 7 ). The patient underwent the Mantoux test, which showed negative results, and chest radiograph showed no signs of TB. The condition was diagnosed as primary TB involving the TMJ. The patient was put on antitubercular therapy for 6 months and she is under regular follow-up. ",0
1197,S2052297516301081,Are patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who are identified through active case finding in the community different than those identified in healthcare facilities?," Methods This study took place in the FCT of Nigeria and comprised two substudies screening adults (?18 years old) for PTB on the basis of cough of more than 2 weeks' duration or other common symptoms associated with TB (night sweats, unexplained fever weight loss or haemoptysis). The studies were conducted between 2010 and 2014. The first study was a multicentre study to evaluate a (then) new scheme called same-day smear microscopy [8]. The FCT arm of this study was conducted in the ambulatory clinics of the FCT Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (TBLCP) based at five district hospitals within Abuja Metropolitan Area Council (AMAC). Patients with symptoms of TB attend spontaneously or are referred to these TB clinics from other health centres or outpatient services and are routinely screened using smear microscopy. In the same-day scheme, we collected two sputum samples 1 hour apart on the day of first consultation. All adults attending the participating clinics with cough of more than 2 weeks' duration were interviewed by trained nurses and were asked to provide sputum specimens for examination. The second group consisted of community-based participants from a prospective study exploring whether visiting households of slum settlements surrounding the FCT AMAC to identify adults with symptoms of PTB would increase TB case detection. All slums of the remaining five FCT local government area councils (Abaji, Bwari, Kuje, Kwali and Gwagwalada) were listed and were visited in turn over a period of 18 months. Traditional local leaders were visited to obtain permission to visit the area. Five teams, each consisting of five community health extension workers (CHEWs), one coordinator and a driver, mapped all the houses partnering with local polio programmes and visited the slums. CHEWs then went from house to house to inquire whether there were any residents with cough of more than 2 weeks’ duration and continued canvasing the settlement until all households were visited. Once one or more symptomatic persons in a household was identified, the CHEWs collected demographic and clinical information and obtained two sputum samples 1 hour apart. Sputum samples in both surveys were transported by study drivers to Zankli TB Research Laboratory the same day as collection. This research laboratory is based at Zankli Medical Centre and is a reference laboratory for the National TBLCP. Smears were examined using light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy and were graded according to WHO criteria [9]. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a similar structured questionnaire in both surveys. For the purposes of analysis, the two smears collected on the spot 1 hour apart were used for analysis to maintain the comparability of the surveys. Individuals with positive sputum smears, defined as having at least one acid-fast bacilli in at least one smear, were considered to have PTB. All participants identified with PTB by the surveys were linked to the nearest treatment centre to initiate appropriate therapy. The individuals with negative smears where considered to be largely free from TB for the purpose of analysis. They were advised to seek health services if their symptoms persisted. Categorical data were summarized using frequency counts and percentages, while continuous data were described using arithmetic means for normally distributed variables (age) and geometric means for skewed variables (e.g. symptom duration). Chi-square and t tests were used to assess significant differences between the groups in categorical and continuous variables respectively. Ethical approval for the first study was obtained from the WHO ethics committee as well as the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and FCT research ethics committees. Approval for the second study was obtained from the latter two committees. All patients were asked to provide written informed consent to participate. ",0
1205,S2212553116300012,"Determining treatment outcome of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases in Afar Regional State, Ethiopia: A retrospective facility based study"," Materials and methods  Study area The Afar Regional State consists of five administrative zones and 30 districts. The size of the population in the region according to the 2007 National Census was about 1,390,273, out of which 775,117 (55.75%) were men and 615,156 (44.25%) women [8].   Study design Health facility-based retrospective data were collected for TB cases that were registered during the study period from 2003 to 2012 and for their treatment outcomes from 2002 to 2012 in the Afar Regional State.   Inclusion and exclusion criteria All forms of TB cases that were registered during the study period were included in the study. Treatment outcomes of extrapulmonary TB and smear-negative pulmonary TB cases were excluded as treatment outcomes mainly focus on smear-positive pulmonary TB cases due to their infectiousness compared to other forms of TB and the scope of study.   Data collection procedures Data were collected by WHO standardized reporting formats for case detection and treatment outcomes. Reports from all zones in the region were collected by trained data collectors and investigators. Data were first collected from health facilities where TB focal persons compiled the data and reported it on a quarterly basis about all TB patients entered into the TB clinic, assigned a unique TB registration number for each TB patient, and submitted the report to zonal TB focal persons who were responsible for compiling a zonal summary, and in turn, the zonal TB focal persons submitted the report to the regional TB Program Officer. The regional TB Program Officer checked the completeness, quality, and accuracy of the reports. Then, data were analyzed and interpreted, and sent as a compiled report to the Office of National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program Office, Federal Ministry of Health.   Data analysis Data that were collected and reported from standardized WHO formats were analyzed and interpreted using excel spread sheets and SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Il, USA). Data were summarized using frequencies, percentages, and standard deviations including for mean values of variables like CDR, TSR, death rate, and defaulter rate.   Data validation Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), Ethiopia used the Health Management Information System for all health program recording and reporting, which consisted of its own unique data collection book and reporting format. Data that were obtained by WHO reporting formats were crosschecked for the data which were obtained in the Health Management Information System for maintaining consistency of information within the study period.   Operational definitions  CDR Percentage of smear-positive TB cases detected among the total number of TB cases estimated to occur.   Smear-positive pulmonary TB A patient with at least two initial sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) with direct microscopy or a patient with only one sputum smear positive for AFB and with chest radiographic abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary TB followed by the clinician’s decision.   Smear-negative pulmonary TB A patient with at least three initial sputum smear negative for AFB with direct microscopy and with chest radiographic abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary TB and no clinical response to 2weeks of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy followed by the clinician’s decision.   Extrapulmonary TB TB involving organs other than the lungs, such as skin, abdomen, joints and bones, lymph nodes, pleura, genitourinary tract, and meninges.   Treatment success rate A sum of smear-positive TB cases who completed treatment and who were declared cured divided by the total smear-positive TB cases in the same period.   Defaulter A patient who has been on treatment for at least 4weeks and whose treatment was interrupted for ?8 consecutive weeks.   Transfer out A patient who has started treatment and has been transferred to another health facility and for whom treatment outcome is not known at the time of evaluation.   Cured A patient who is sputum-smear negative 1month prior to the completion of treatment and on at least one previous occasion (usually at the end of the 2nd month or 5th month).   Treatment completed A patient who has completed treatment but in whom smear results are not available at or 1month prior to the completion of treatment.   Treatment failure A patient who remained smear positive or became smear positive again at the end of ?5months after commencing treatment.    Ethical considerations The study secured ethical clearance from institutional review board of afar regional stat health bureau.  ",0
1213,S0399077X04001787,Tuberculosis of the parotid gland: case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 35-year-old Greek woman presented to our department with a swelling of the left parotid gland, which developed gradually in 9 months. Her medical history was unremarkable. There was no family history of tuberculosis. Since the beginning of the disease she had never noticed fever, cough, weight loss or any other systemic symptoms. She had no difficulty in swallowing, change in voice or discharge into the mouth. She was first admitted to another hospital and was given several courses of different broad-spectrum antibiotics. She underwent also a draining puncture aspiration of the parotid mass, without improvement. Standard stainings and cultures were negative. Staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and culture of the discharge for Mycobacteriae were both negative. Tuberculin test produced a wheal of 9 mm. The patient underwent open biopsy. The resected specimen was a lobulated soft tissue mass, the cut surface of which showed multiple white nodules with central necrosis. Microscopy confirmed multiple granulomas with necrosis in the parotid gland. Staining for AFB was negative, but the tissue was not cultured for Mycobacteriae. Upon admission to our department, there was a mobile, firm and neither tender nor pulsatile parotid lesion not attached to the bone or to the surrounding soft tissues. The overlying skin was reddish, with a normal temperature. There were two discharging sinuses. Left cervical lymphadenopathy was present. No other findings were present in physical examination. Laboratory investigations were normal, except for a mild lymphocytopenia. Chest radiograph was also normal. Contrast enhanced CT showed an enlarged left parotid gland with vague heterogeneous diffuse parenchymal enhancement, as well as a mass extending to the parapharyngal region. The cervical lymph nodes in the region had similar image morphology. With the clinico-laboratory suspicion of TB parotitis, we ordered polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacteriae in the paraffin-embedded material of the original biopsy. The investigation was positive for M. tuberculosis complex and TB parotitis was diagnosed. The patient was started on a three drug antituberculous regimen, i.e. isoniazid, ethambutol and rifampicin. Being now in the third month of therapy she showed a slow, progressive improvement with her left parotid swelling and cervical lymphadenopathy having substantially subsided. ",0
1226,S1268773103000961,Delayed presentation of tuberculosis of the talo-navicular joint: a case report," 2 Discussion This case history demonstrates that although extremely rare, tuberculosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a chronically inflamed foot or ankle. The delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis could have been avoided if a high degree of suspicion had been maintained from the start. The incidental history of trauma was misleading, as was the admission for cellulitis and lymphangitis which responded to intravenous antibiotics. The fact that the patient was afebrile and systemically well, with only mildly raised inflammatory markers, and a negative gram stain, in the face of severe local findings, pointed towards a chronic inflammatory arthritis. The osteopenia with irregular destruction found on the radiographs and CT scans is typical, but by no means diagnostic. The literature was reviewed for tuberculosis involving the foot and ankle. The most comprehensive work has been done by Dhillon and Nagi [1] in India, who reviewed 74 cases over an 11-year period, and stressed the diagnostic delays caused by lack of awareness of the condition. Case reports in the West are rare [2–8]. ",0
1260,S2212553115000709,Immunoconfirmation of central nervous system tuberculosis by blotting: A study of 300 cases," Materials and methods  Samples A total of 300 CSF samples were analyzed in the present study by ELISA and Western blotting. Informed consent was obtained from subjects before CSF was collected by lumbar puncture. Institutional ethical approval was sought for the study. Of the 300 CSF samples, 240 belonged to chronic meningitis categories which were suspected for TBM. Non-tuberculous cases (n =30) involved Pyogenic meningitis, Cryptococcal meningitis, Neurocysticercosis and Viral meningoencephalitis. Non-diseased controls (n =30) involved subjects undergoing spinal anesthesia for non-neurological causes. The inclusion and exclusion of subject selection were followed as per the criteria of Marais et al. [21].  Suspected TBM CSF samples (n =240) Patients with clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis including one or more of the following presentations like headache, irritability, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, convulsions, focal deficits, altered consciousness over a period of one week and with typical radiological images showing meningeal involvement and/or CSF culture positive for AFB were classified as TBM cases. In the present study, the initial presentation of cases is shown in Table 1 . Patients were classified as ‘highly probable’ TBM, ‘probable’ TBM, ‘possible’ TBM and non-TBM. Confirmed TBM is based on a clinical presentation with bacterial isolation from CSF. In the present study, highly probable, probable and possible TBM are altogether grouped as suspected TBM for Western blot. The criteria followed for highly probable TBM (n =53) are clinical diagnosis as TBM, radiological impression as TBM and/or CSF antibody positive by ELISA. Probable TBM (n =85) is considered when clinical diagnosis presents as TBM, and doubtful radiological impression for TBM/antibody positivity by ELISA. Possible TBM (n =102) is clinical suspicion of TBM or radiological impression of TBM or antibody positivity by ELISA.   Non-tuberculous meningitis controls (n =30) Cases in which an alternative diagnosis is established without a definitive diagnosis of TBM with convincing signs of other disease were categorized as non-tuberculous meningitis cases. Thirty CSF samples were taken as non-tuberculous meningitis cases which included cases with Pyogenic meningitis which were confirmed by isolation of Diplococcus pneumonia, Cryptococcal meningitis cases confirmed by isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans, and Neurocysticercosis cases confirmed by anticysticercal antibody in the CSF against Taenia solium cyst antigen. Viral meningitis cases were confirmed by the presence of antibodies to CNS viruses or positive by PCR.   Non-infectious diseased controls (n =30) Subjects undergoing spinal anesthesia for non-neurological causes like hernia, hydrocele, etc., served as non-diseased controls.    Other materials MTB (H37Ra) culture, sonicator, other common laboratory reagents, apparatus for Western blot, and ELISA were the other materials used.   Preparation of antigen MTB (H37Ra) was a kind gift from the National Referral Laboratory JALMA, Agra (India). The organism was grown on LJ media. Later the culture was transferred to 250ml Sauton’s liquid media and incubated at 37°C with gentle agitation for 6weeks. The above culture was centrifuged at 10,000rpm at 4°C for 30min to separate culture filtrate. The pellet was inactivated by 5% phenol solution for one hour and re-pelleted. The pellet was re-suspended in PBS, and the suspension was sonicated in an ice bath for 15min (Sonics vibra cells, U.S.A), followed by centrifugation to get clear sonicated supernatant rich in protein. The protein content was measured/adjusted and used for ELISA and Western blotting.   Indirect ELISA ELISA was done according to the method described earlier [17]. Briefly, 96 well microtitre plates (Dynatech, U.S.A) were coated with MTB sonicated extract (MTSE) antigen (10?g/mL) in PBS, 50?l per well, by overnight incubation at 4°C in a moist chamber. Unbound antigen was removed by washing with PBST. Nonspecific free binding sites of the wells were blocked with freshly prepared PBST-milk 1% at 37°C for 2h. After incubation, the plates were tap dried and stored at ?20°C in dry condition until further use. The CSF samples to be tested were diluted (1:10) in PBST milk 1% and 50?l of the diluted samples were added to the wells in duplicates. The plate was incubated for 90min in a moist chamber at 37°C and then washed with PBST ×5 and tap dried; 50?l of secondary antibody (anti-human IgG, Dakopatts, Denmark) conjugated with HRP (1:3000 dilutions in PBST-milk) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 60min. The plates were later washed with PBST and tap dried. Substrate (O-phenylene di-amine dissolved in phosphate citrate buffer with hydrogen peroxide) was added to each well (75?l) and allowed for color development for 10–15min. The reaction was arrested by adding 50?l of 2N H2SO4. The readings were taken by ELISA reader (Sunrise-Magellan, Tecan AG, Austria) at 492nm. The cutoff value was calculated on the basis of the absorbance (OD) value of controls (n =60) by taking mean of it plus three standard deviations (SD).   Western blot The antigens of MTB sonicated extract (MTSE) were subjected to SDS–PAGE. The antigens were first separated on polyacrylamide gel (12%) in 0.1% SDS, along with the protein marker with constant voltage in a discontinuous buffer system using Hoeffer electrophoresis apparatus (U.S.A.). The antigens thus separated were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane (0.45?m pore size, MDI, Ambala, India) by electro blotting (Hoeffer, U.S.A.). The blotted nitrocellulose membrane having MTSE antigen was cut into fine strips of 3mm breadth (8–10?g of MTSE/strip) and stored at ?20°C until further use. The strips were washed with distilled water before use and later incubated with CSF diluted in 1% PBST milk (1:10) at room temperature with gentle overnight shaking. After washing for 5 times with tris-buffered saline (TBS), the strips were incubated with goat anti-human IgG immunoglobulin tagged HRP (Dakopatts, Denmark, 1:1000 in PBST milk) for 3h at room temperature. After incubation, the strips were washed 5 times with TBS and were then developed with substrate (4-chloronaphthol) and later stored in distilled water. Immune reactivity to MTB antigens was also checked by using monoclonal antibodies obtained from Dr. J. Ivanyi, Wellcome Laboratories (UK).  ",0
1262,S0901502714000617,Primary pharyngeal tuberculosis presenting as a submucosal tumour," Case report A 58-year-old male attended the outpatient ward due to a globus sensation in the throat of 2-month duration. He did not report dyspnoea, anorexia, cough, fever, chills, halitosis, rhinorrhea, sputum, pharyngeal pruritus, or hemoptysis. There was no past history of tuberculosis infection or surgery, and he had not been in contact with infected people. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. On physical examination, he was of a slim build and had a non-anaemic appearance. There was no palpable lymph node and no sign of infection or fistula in the head and neck. Chest examination revealed no abnormal breathing sounds or radiological alterations. On flexible nasopharyngoscopic examination, the pharynx showed a swelling of the right posterior oropharyngeal wall measuring about 2cm×3cm. Serum electrolytes and the results of kidney and liver function tests were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a low-attenuation lesion of 3cm×4cm with rim enhancement and postero-inferior calcification on the right side of the oropharyngeal wall (Fig. 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a homogeneous lesion with high signal intensity in T2-weighted images and low signal intensity with peripheral rim enhancement in T1-weighted images. The lesion was thought to be a submucosal tumour, and complete excision via the intraoral approach was planned. However, adhesion to the pharyngeal mucosa and visceral fascia prevented an en bloc excision, so a piecemeal excision was performed. Gross inspection of the surgical specimen revealed a well-defined submucosal mass filled with cheese-like calcified material. Histopathological examination revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis and Langhans giant cells surrounded by lymphocytes (Fig. 2a). The collected tissue was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using a commercial M. tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (MTB and NTM) PCR kit (BioSewoom Inc., Seoul, Korea) (Fig. 2b). Ziehl–Neelsen staining did not show any acid-fast bacilli, and M. tuberculosis was not cultured from the sputum. Based on these results, a diagnosis of primary pharyngeal tuberculosis without pulmonary tuberculosis was made. Treatment was started with an oral regimen consisting of four anti-tuberculous agents for 10 weeks (isoniazid 300mg, rifampicin 600mg, ethambutol 800mg, and pyrazinamide 1000mg), after which treatment was continued with an oral regimen of three anti-tuberculous agents for 16 weeks (as above, but without pyrazinamide). After 26 weeks of treatment, the patient was asymptomatic. He has been followed up for 12 months without any signs of disease recurrence. ",0

The patient was primarily examined by the otorhinolaryngology department, with complaints of swelling and pain in the right side of his tongue. The histopathology of the first biopsy specimen did not provide a specific diagnosis. The patient was later referred to our hospital with the diagnosis of tuberculosis after the observation of caseification necrosis in the epithelioid granuloma in the second biopsy specimen taken from the tongue. There was an ulcerative lesion in the right side of the patient's tongue (Fig. 1 ). HIV test was negative. There was a cavitary lesion in the upper right lobe and bilateral miliary infiltration in the chest X-ray. Mycobacterium tuberculosis could not be detected in the sputum microscopy. Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol were administered. After the first week of treatment, pain was subsided and the lesions in tongue regressed in several weeks. ",0

Philips Brilliance 16 CT equipment was used for radiological examination. The slices were 1 mm thick, so between 1600 and 2500 slices were needed, depending on the range to be covered. Using the raw data, the slices were reconstructed in HRCT mode. During the post-processing, a narrower, so-called bone-window was used. For the 3D reconstruction, the inbuilt program of the Philips CT equipment was applied. The skeletal and mummified tissues from the two Nigrovits' were examined for the presence of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex as part of earlier researches on the Vác mummies [4,5]. The examination showed that 55% of the examined individuals were positive, and that the incidence varied according to age at death and sampling site in the body [4]. A later, more comprehensive study [5] gave a positive result in 67.7% of individuals, ranging from 46.5% in children, 89.7% in middle-age and 69.6% in individuals older than 65 years. Single samples proved a positive result in 55.8%, multiple samples in 78.5% of the cases. Recommended ancient DNA (aDNA) protocols [6] were followed throughout the DNA extraction, with separate rooms for different stages of the process. The procedures have been described previously [4,7]. In brief, small quantities of crushed or powdered sample were demineralized in Proteinase K/EDTA at 56 °C for 1–4 days. One aliquot was treated with 0.1 M N-phenacylthiazolium bromide, a reagent that cleaves glucose-derived protein cross-links [8] and has been found to be useful in DNA extractions from some archaeological samples. Thereafter both aliquots were lysed in guanidium thiocyanate solution and DNA captured onto silica in suspension or by isopropanol precipitation of the residual supernatant, washed, and dried until use. Negative extraction controls were always included and extractions and analyses repeated. The DNA amplification details have been described previously [4,5,7]. In brief, the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was detected by targeting a specific region of the repetitive element IS6110 using a two-tube nested PCR that yields an outer product of 123 bp and a nested PCR product of 92 bp (Table 1 ). Qiagen Hotstar® Taq polymerase and reagents (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) were used. Negative controls were always routinely included. PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels, visualized by ethidium bromide staining exposed under ultraviolet light and recorded with a Polaroid camera. Later, the lung tissue of the body 54 was re-examined using real-time PCR [9] with specific primers and probe (Table 1) for the target IS1081 (6 copies/cell). Bone samples were taken from both individuals for histological and paleoproteomic investigations. A left rib fragment (7th–10th) and a vertebral body (5th–7th) of No 29, and a fragment from the shaft of the right fibula of No 54 were examined. All bone surfaces were investigated using a magnifying glass. Thin-ground sections were prepared as described by Schultz [10]. Additionally, all three samples were used to extract and detect extracellular bone matrix proteins [11]. The paleoproteomic analysis of these cases is still in progress. ",0
1276,S2210740115002879,Hepato-peritoneal tuberculosis with negative interferon gamma assay (Quantiferon™) in an immunocompetent patient: A case report," Case report A 41-years-old Comorian man was admitted to our department after presenting with a one-month history of abdominal pain and altered general condition. He had no personal or familial past and took no treatment. He was neither smoker nor alcohol consumer. He had been previously vaccinated against tuberculosis (BCG) and denied any recent travel or contact with the infected patients. He described a three-month history of progressive weakness, anorexia and weight loss of 5 kilograms in the last month. He complained of diffuse abdominal pain and night sweats. On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically stable and body temperature was 39.5°C. Physical examination revealed a tense abdomen with shifting dullness. There was no jaundice, no hepatomegaly and no splenomegaly. Bowel sounds were present. Furthermore, no peripheral lymph node was palpable and there was no peripheral edema. Heart sounds were normal with decreased breath sounds on the left lower chest. The rest of the physical examination was normal. The full blood count (FBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal. The biochemistry revealed isolated hyponatremia (129mmol/L). Renal and liver function tests were normal. INR was 1.3 due to vitamin K dependent factors deficiency. Furthermore, levels of lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2-microglobulin were increased at 791IU/L and 4mg/L, respectively. Urine cultures were sterile. HIV, HBV and HCV serologies were negative. Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM and IgA) were normal. Three blood cultures were sterile and research of BK in sputum and three days gastric aspirations were negative. Adenosine deaminase assay (Diazyme-Cobas™ 5000) was raised in blood (1.5N). Quantiferon™ assay was twice negative in serum. The ascitic tap found a lymphocytic exsudate (protein level=59g/L) with 1070 elements/mm3 (75% lymphocytes). Adenosine deaminase assay was raised in ascites (3.5N). Abdominal and pelvic CT confirmed the presence of intra-peritoneal fluid and a left pleural effusion. Laparoscopy confirmed lymphocytic ascites with diffuse peritoneal and liver granulations. Peritoneal and hepatic biopsies both confirmed the presence of epithelioid granuloma with central caseous necrosis. Furthermore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures were positive with the presence of mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen (SD TB ag MPT64 Rapid technic) despite negative DNA research (GeneXpert MIB/RIF-Cepheid) in peritoneal fluid. Presumptive antituberculosis treatment was introduced (rifampicin 10mg/kg/d, isoniazid 5mg/kg/d, pyrazinamide 40mg/kg/d and ethambutol 30mg/kg/d) and continued for 6 months after tuberculosis confirmation. There was dramatic evidence of favorable clinical evolution during treatment (ascites control, weight gain, transaminases normalization). Finally, peritoneal and hepatic tuberculosis with a negative Quantiferon™ assay diagnosis was made. ",0
1278,S1755001711000546,"A case of preventable pulmonary tuberculosis in a Greenlandic, heavily immune suppressed patient"," 2 Case report A 45-year old male of Greenlandic origin was admitted to the acute medical ward at a university hospital in Copenhagen in May 2010 with a productive cough, weight loss and general malaise of one-week duration. He had a medical history of severe sero-negative RA and Bechterew’s disease, and was being treated with PSL 5 mg daily, Methotrexate (MTX) 12.5 mg weekly and Infliximab (INF) infusions every 8 weeks. The patient was born and raised in Greenland, had moved to Denmark 13 years ago, and socialised within the Greenlandic community in Copenhagen. The patient had previously been known to have an alcohol abuse, but denied any current drug or substance abuse. Vital parameters upon admission showed a normal blood pressure (119/80), a respiratory rate of 14, tachycardia (pulse 90) and subfebrility (temp. 37.7 °C). Clinical examination revealed pallor and cold sweating. Chest examination revealed a dampened percussion over the basal right lung field with reduced breath sounds upon auscultation. Abdominal examination found epigastric tenderness. Routine laboratory investigations revealed elevated leucocytes 10.3 (reference: 3.0–9.0), thrombocytosis of 522 (reference: 140–340), sodium 130 (reference: 136–146) and CRP 241 (reference: <10). Chest X-ray found a right-sided basal infiltrate and pleural effusion (see Fig. 1A and B). A tentative diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was made and intravenous Cefuroxime treatment was initiated. Sputum and blood cultures were later found negative for bacteria and fungi. Direct microscopy of sputum and pleural fluid were both found negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. In the following days the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated with tachypnoea (respiratory rate 35–40), rising body temperature (39–40 °C) and sinus-tachycardia (rate 100–120). Medication was altered to intravenous Meropenem. One-week later, another sputum test was analysed for M. tuberculosis; this was also microscopy negative, but was found positive using nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing. A gastric lavage fluid sample was at the same time also found positive both through direct microscopy and NAA testing. Anti-tuberculous treatment was started immediately. The sputum sample revealed growth of fully sensitive M. tuberculosis after several weeks’ culture. The patient recovered slowly and was discharged after three weeks. Two days later, the patient was re-hospitalised in a weakened, febrile state and with radiological progression of residual pleural effusion; he was discharged after three weeks. Prior to initiating INF treatment in September 2009, the outpatient rheumatology clinic that followed the patient had tested him for LTBI using TST, chest X-ray and QFT. The TST was negative and the chest X-ray showed, according to the radiologist, apical unilateral chronic calcifications; the x-ray is in the patient file described as ‘normal’. QFT was inconclusive and the department had not followed the recommendation of repeating the test. It had not been noted in the medical record whether or not the patient was BCG vaccinated – in later entries from the infectious disease departments, it is however noted that the patient had a BCG scar. Throughout the course of the first week of admission, it was discovered that in March 2010, the patient had been tested for TB as a routine part of contact tracing, due to recent contact with a newly diagnosed pulmonary TB index patient. A chest X-ray at the time revealed chronic pulmonary changes and the Quantiferon Gold in tube (QFT) test was negative. The department in charge of contact tracing claims not to have any knowledge of neither the patient’s rheumatologic disease nor current medication. At the time of testing, the patient was taking three different types of immunosuppressive treatment: PSL, MTX, INF. The patient has now completed the follow-up program at an infectious disease outpatient clinic and has received a total of 9 months of anti-tuberculous treatment; the reason for choosing a longer regime was partly that INF infusions were continued during the anti-tuberculous treatment and partly due to compliance issues.

1286,S2214250916300063,Extra pulmonary tuberculosis presenting as fever with massive splenomegaly and pancytopenia," Case report A 13-year old male, a native of Kerala, India, a student was referred in January 2006 for high grade intermittent fever with rigors and chills of one month duration. He did not complain of cough, hemoptysis, neck swellings or other associated symptoms. He had not traveled outside his district. The young man reported a history of bronchial asthma for last 10 years requiring very occasional treatment with bronchodilators. He did not use alcohol or tobacco. No significant family history except that his father having diabetes. His parents noticed significant weight loss and loss of appetite. On physical examination he was moderately built, anicteric and poorly nourished with pallor with pulse: 108/mt. and temp. 101°F. There was no lymphadenopathy, bleeding manifestations, rash or eschar. Abdominal examination revealed a firm non-nodular liver 5cm below the right costal margin and an enlarged spleen of 10cm below the left costal margin (Fig. 1 ). No ascites was noted. Optic fundi examination was normal. ",0
1299,S1201971216311092,The additional yield of GeneXpert MTB/RIF test in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis among household contacts of smear positive TB cases," 2 Methods  2.1 Study design and setting A cross sectional study was conducted among sputum smear positive index TB cases and their household contacts. The study was done at eleven TB diagnostic and treatment health centers in North Gondar zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia between May 2013 and April 2015. North Gondar Zone has a total population of 3.6 million with TB case notification rate of 119 per 100,000 population (Unpublished data, Management Sciences for Health, 2015). There are three hospitals and 133 public health centers providing TB prevention and control services in the zone. Health centers are operated by Nurses, Health Officers, Laboratory Technicians, Pharmacy Technicians and administrative staff. The eleven health centers included in the study were selected as they are closer to Gondar University Hospital so that sputum specimens for GeneXpert test could be transported easily. These health centers have been participating in the external quality assurance (EQA) program of the country for ZN microscopy. The false positivity and false negativity rate of AFB slide readings at health facilities against the EQA center readings in the study area were found to be 0.19% and 0.17% respectively (Unpublished data, Management Sciences for Health, 2015).   2.2 Identification of index TB cases and their household contacts We trained TB focal persons in the eleven health centers on the data collection, symptomatic screening, sputum sample collection and referral. New AFB sputum smear positive patients diagnosed in the 11 health centers during the study period who had at least one household family member were included in the study. Once the patient was diagnosed, the address of the patient was recorded. The contact details of 119 consecutive smear positive index TB cases were noted. All index cases were either asked to bring their household contacts to the health center or visited at home by the study team composed of supervisors and community health workers called health extension workers (HEW) within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Household contact was defined as a person who shared the same enclosed living space for one or more nights or for frequent or extended periods during the day with the index case during the 3 months before commencement of the current treatment episode 9 . TB focal persons and both urban and rural HEWs were involved in registering the household contacts and screening of contacts for symptoms suggestive of TB.   2.3 Data collection and TB symptom screening A baseline data was filled in a standardized questionnaire for each index smear positive TB case by the TB focal person in the health centers. The major information collected was socio-demographic data, signs and symptoms, duration of illness, contact history and the laboratory results. A family matrix form was used to register all household contacts. A standard questionnaire was administered by the TB focal person or HEWs to each household contact independently that included socio-demographic characteristics and relationship status to the index case. The TB focal person or HEWs registered the household contacts and screened them for the major signs and symptoms of TB. Household contacts with history of cough for two or more weeks or with two or more symptoms suggestive of TB were considered to have presumptive TB 8 . Presumptive TB cases were referred to the health center for further evaluation and laboratory investigation (ZN microscopy and GeneXpert).   2.4 TB diagnosis Three sputum samples (Spot-Morning-Spot) were collected at the health centers from each household contact with presumptive TB. Morning sputum specimens were also collected from the 119 index TB cases for GeneXpert test. All the 119 index TB cases were already put on first line anti-TB drug treatment based on the ZN microscopy result and continued the treatment even if the GeneXpert test result turned out negative. The TB focal persons in the respective health centers transported the sputum samples to Gondar University hospital following the standard infection control and specimen transportation procedures (using cold box) for GeneXpert test. Trained senior laboratory personnel in the health centers and Gondar University hospital were engaged in conducting the ZN microscopy and GeneXpert tests, respectively. The laboratory personnel doing ZN microscopy and GeneXpert MTB/RIF test were blinded. The three samples from contacts were tested for AFB by ZN sputum smear microscopy and GeneXpert test was also done on the morning sputum sample. In addition, GeneXpert test was done on the morning sputum specimens collected from the index TB cases.   2.5 Data analysis Data entry and analysis was performed using SPSS, Version 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Data was entered by an experienced data clerk under the supervision of the principal investigator. Frequency, percentage and 95% confidence interval of proportions were computed. The number needed to screen (NNS) and number needed to test (NNT) was also computed. NNS is the number of contacts required to be screened to detect a single case of active TB; NNT is the number of contacts with presumptive TB required to be investigated in the laboratory to detect a single case of active TB. The 95% confidence intervals of proportion among different categories were compared: absence of overlap in 95% confidence intervals is considered as a statistically significant difference.   2.6 Ethical considerations Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Gondar ethical review board [reference number RCS/P/05/485/2013 dated June 4th 2013]. Each study participant provided a written informed consent and permission was obtained from all health facilities. Written parental consent was also obtained for participants below the age of 18 years. Household contacts with positive TB result were treated in accordance with the national tuberculosis program recommendations 11 . Rifampicin resistant results by GeneXpert test were immediately communicated to each health centers for proper management of patients as per the national tuberculosis program recommendations 11 .

1304,S2212534512000299,Two cases of tuberculosis with multiple drug hypersensitivity after drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome," 2 Case reports  2.1 Case 1 (clinical course is shown in Fig. 1)  A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for treatment of lung tuberculosis in early June 2010. Her medical history included liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C at age of 40 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at age of 55. Methotrexate (MTX) and 4mg of oral prednisolone (PSL) was initiated in March 2009 to treat RA. Chest radiography showed a cavity and a small nodule in the right lower field. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a thick-walled cavity limited to the right lower lobe and ground-glass opacities in both bases with obvious liver cirrhosis ( Fig. 2). Due to the presence of liver cirrhosis, rifampicin (RFP), ethambutol (EB), levofloxacin (LVFX), and streptomycin (SM) were initiated on June 4, 2010. MTX was switched to SASP on June 9 because CT showed interstitial pneumonia, which was thought to be caused by MTX. On July 7, nausea and vomiting developed, and then generalized skin eruptions subsequently developed along with a fever of 37.4°C. Abnormal laboratory findings included slightly elevated liver enzymes (AST, 42 IU/L; ALT, 39IU/L) and an elevated eosinophil count of 0.437×109/L. Physical examination showed erythematous papules and macules with confluence over her trunk, extremities, and face. Although all antituberculosis drugs were discontinued on July 18, her symptoms did not improve, and SASP was also discontinued on July 26. However, the generalized eruptions continued. After 1 week of treatment with 25mg/day of oral PSL beginning on July 28, her skin rash improved slightly and fever disappeared. Therefore, RFP and SM were re-administered on August 3; however, a slight fever and worsening of skin rash occurred, and both drugs were discontinued ( Fig. 3a). LVFX, SM, and EB were then re-administered in the same order from August 9 to 12. Although the high-grade fever of >38°C appeared only once, worsening of the skin rash was not observed. On August 14, SASP was added and skin eruptions developed on the same day; therefore, SASP was discontinued. RFP desensitization was attempted starting on August 23; however, it failed on September 4 because of skin rash worsening. On September 8, we gradually initiated isoniazid (INH); however, at the end of September, a high-grade fever and worsening of the skin rash occurred (Fig. 3b). All antituberculosis drugs were discontinued, and systemic steroid chemotherapy was initiated on October 4. Testing for HHV-6 immunoglobulin (Ig)G was then performed for the first time, and the test showed an extremely high titer of HHV-6 IgG (2560×). Based on the high HHV-6 IgG titer and clinical course, DIHS was diagnosed. After the skin rash improved due to 1 month of intravenous and oral steroid therapy, we carefully administered EB, LVFX, and SM in the same order from October 1 to 8. However, on the day SM administration was initiated, fever and rash occurred and SM was discontinued. On October 12, INH was re-added to the continuing EB and LVFX treatments, and no fever developed. However, alopecia and a slight skin eruption gradually progressed (Fig. 3c). On December 15, the HHV-6 IgG titer decreased to 320×; however, liver enzymes increased again and all antituberculosis drugs were discontinued. Two weeks later, the skin eruption improved, indicating the presence of persistent drug allergy. Therefore, we considered it impossible to successfully complete tuberculosis treatment. Surgical resection was performed in January 2011. Since then, the skin rash and alopecia have drastically improved (Fig. 3d).   2.2 Case 2 (clinical course is shown in Fig. 4)  A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for treatment of tuberculous pericarditis in December 1996. He had a previous history of a renal disorder of unknown cause at age of 54. Chest radiography on admission showed severe cardiomegaly, and chest CT demonstrated pericardial and pleural effusions ( Fig. 5). After draining the pericardial effusion, which was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, RFP, INH, and EB therapy were initiated. At the end of January 1997, liver enzymes were elevated and all drugs were discontinued. After improvement of liver dysfunction, INH, LVFX, RFP, and EB in the same order were cautiously re-administered from February 11 to 13. Thirty milligrams of oral PSL was simultaneously added to treat pericarditis, which gradually reduced. In addition, allopurinol was administered on February 21 to treat hyperuricemia. On March 29, skin eruptions developed on his trunk and gradually spread to his extremities and face. On April 7, a high-grade fever of >39°C developed and all antituberculosis drugs were discontinued. On April 11, allopurinol was also stopped; however, the fever and skin rash persisted. Physical examination revealed a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash that was predominantly observed on his trunk. Abnormal laboratory findings on April 14 showed leukocytosis (12.5×109/L) and eosinophilia (2.57×109/L) with atypical lymphocytes and renal and liver dysfunction (AST, 113IU/L; ALT, 109IU/L; BUN, 82mg/dL; Cr, 3.20mg/dL). The results of a skin biopsy from his back on April 22 showed perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes in the upper layer of the dermis, which was compatible with non-specific chronic dermatitis. With systemic steroid therapy, the skin eruptions improved somewhat and renal and liver function became normal by mid-May. Therefore, EB and SM were re-administered on May 15 and LVFX on June 3; however, exacerbation of the skin rash and renal function recurred along with fever (Cr, 1.37mg/dL). Although LVFX was discontinued on June 4, the symptoms did not improve and all antituberculosis drugs were stopped. Steroid therapy was then re-initiated. On July 14, we attempted INH desensitization, but the rash worsened and a fever developed. Therefore, we believed that it would be extremely difficult to continue treatment and chose to carefully observe his progress without administering antituberculosis drugs. Fortunately, tuberculous pericarditis did not worsen for a long time. In December 2010, the patient developed lung tuberculosis. Considering his previous clinical course with suspected DIHS, we carefully initiated antituberculous medication. Although a skin rash developed due to EB and/or pyrazinamide (PZA), we were able to successfully complete treatment with RFP and INH in October 2011.  ",0
1325,S0732889313003763,Application of cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium chloride decontamination method for recovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from clinically suspected cases of pulmonary tuberculosis," 2 Materials and methods The study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology and Chest and TB department of M.M. Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Ambala, India, a tertiary care hospital (1050 bedded) that also functions as a peripheral centre for the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). All patients, presenting with productive cough for more than 2 weeks or longer and who gave a written informed consent to participate in the study and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, were recruited prospectively for this test evaluation study. In addition, the other clinical information like persistent low-grade fever (>37 °C for 2 weeks), night sweats, loss of appetite, dyspnoea, chest pain, and haemoptysis was also recorded. However, patients taking or who has taken anti-TB treatment in the last 6 months were excluded. A total of 2 sputum specimens (spot sample at clinic and morning sample at home) from each patient were collected. Further, all the specimens were transported immediately to the microbiology laboratory (Department of Microbiology, M.M.I.M.S.R) and refrigerated (4–8 °C) overnight. After receiving the second sputum samples, both sputum samples, specifically spot sample at clinic and morning sample at home, were mixed by pouring the sample from one bottle to another containing undrilled glass beads (1–2 mm, Himedia, Mumbai, India). The mixing of each specimen was performed to obtain similar quality and adequate quantity for performing all the tests; in fact, during each sampling, most of the patients expectorated insufficient quantity (3–4 mL) of sputum and were inadequate to perform all the techniques. Thereafter, the sputum specimens were subjected to homogenization (using a Pasteur pipette for one min) and vortex for 2 min to ensure the uniform distribution of bacilli. After homogenization, the sputum specimen was divided into 3 parts, the first 0.5 mL was used for direct Auramine ‘O’ smears, the aliquots of 2–3 mL each in a 50-mL and 14-mL Falcon tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for NALC-NaOH and CPC-NaCl decontamination methods, respectively.

1332,S0894731702000317,Cardiac tuberculosis with multiple intracardiac masses: A case report," Case report A 25-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of dyspnea and abdominal swelling. Her history revealed abdominal pain and diarrhea episodes for 1 year. She had been diagnosed and treated for typhoid fever during this period without any benefit. Recently, she noticed facial and abdominal swelling, edema in the legs, anorexia, and weight loss. Moreover, she developed exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, and white sputum. She was found to have a right-sided pleural effusion by examination and on chest radiograph, and she was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. From her family history it was learned that she had an uncle who was treated for tuberculosis. On physical examination, the pulse was 62 bpm, blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, and temperature was 38.4°C. There were several lymph node enlargements in the neck region, and jugular venous distension was apparent. The lung and heart examination showed fine rales on the right base of the lungs and a mild mitral regurgitation murmur. She also had hepatomegaly and bilateral pitting pretibial edema. Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated sedimentation rate of 41 mm/h and mild anemia (hemoglobin: 10.7 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume: 78 fL, hematocrit: 31.8%). There were no specific findings in the other laboratory analysis. An electrocardiogram revealed no significant findings. A pleural tap was performed, and cytologic examination revealed lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes; culture was negative. The transthoracic echocardiography showed multiple masses in the RA, LA (Figures 1, A, and 2, A), and left ventricular apex.  Fig. 1   A, Parasternal long-axis view showing masses in left atrium. B, Parasternal long-axis view after 4-month antituberculosis treatment. AO, Aorta; LV, left ventricle; LA, left atrium.       Fig. 2   A, Parasternal short-axis view of mass in right atrium. B, Parasternal short-axis view after 4-month antituberculosis treatment. RV, Right ventricle; AO, aorta; RA, right atrium; LA, left atrium.    There was also a mild pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiography showed that the mass in the RA was extending from the superior vena cava to the inferior vena cava (Figure 3), and there were also multiple masses in the LA and LV.  Fig. 3  Transesophageal echocardiographic view of mass in right atrium.      Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a mass invading the whole mediastinum, pericardium, and superior vena cava, as well as enlarged hepatic veins and inferior vena cava, hepatomegaly with a diffuse contrast enhancement, ascites, and pleural thickening over the bases of the lungs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the heart showed a mass starting from the cardiac apex and surrounding the whole heart with continuity along the superior vena cava and aortic root. The intracardiac masses showed round, nodular characteristics. A right atrial mass was extending from the anterolateral surface of the RA and showed indentation to the right atrial cavity (Figure 4).  Fig. 4  Magnetic resonance imaging of masses in heart.    The mass also invaded the left ventricular wall. The RA and inferior vena cava were markedly dilated. There was also slight dilatation in the LA. A thoracotomy was performed and a mass invading the inferior vena cava, RA, and anterior wall of LV was seen. Frozen biopsy was taken from the mass invading the RA and revealed a granulomatous disease consistent with tuberculosis, and multiple excisional biopsies from the superior vena cava, left subclavian lymph node enlargement, and heart were obtained. Pathologic examination revealed caseating, granulomatous inflammation typical for tuberculosis. A microbiologic culture and polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Antituberculosis treatment was started (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for 2 months; later isoniazid and rifampin were continued). She was seen monthly after therapy, and at the fourth month of treatment the patient's general condition was improved. Echocardiographic examination showed that the masses in the LA had almost totally disappeared, and the mass in the RA was very small compared with the beginning state (Figures 1, B, and 2, B ). ",0
1340,S0378113510005675,Accidental infection of veterinary personnel with Mycobacterium tuberculosis at necropsy: A case study," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Clinical case A 7-year-old, castrated male Ibizan Hound (Podengo Iberico) had been taken to the small animal clinic of the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern. The dog showed signs of apathy and neurological symptoms and had previously been treated for conjunctivitis with prednisolone for 1 month (initial immunosuppressive dosage 2mg/kg bid and then tapered to 0.5mg/kg bid). The dog had been adopted five years earlier from a Swiss animal shelter where he originally arrived as a stray dog imported from southern Europe (exact country of origin unknown).   2.2 Pathology A complete necropsy following a standard protocol which included opening of the brain cavity using an electric Stryker saw was performed. Samples of liver, lung, spleen, kidney, heart, and the entire brain were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 72h or 1 week (brain tissue), routinely processed for histology, and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and with Ziehl–Neelsen.   2.3 Microbiology Identification of mycobacteria was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. DNA was extracted, and partial sequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene was performed using the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems) (Patel et al., 2000). The sequence was submitted to the Ribosomal Differentiation of Medical Microorganisms (RIDOM) database (Harmsen et al., 1999). Differentiation of the MTB complex members was performed using the GenoType® MTBC assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH). The GenoType® MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience) assay (Hillemann et al., 2007) was used to identify mutational changes within the katG, inhA and rpoB genes, which are associated with drug resistance. Spoligotyping was performed as described previously (Kamerbeek et al., 1997). The data was compiled in Microsoft Excel and analyzed by using the MIRU-VNTRplus online analysis tool (http://www.miru-vntrplus.org) (Allix-Beguec et al., 2008).   2.4 Contact investigation of veterinary personnel Between 12 and 15 weeks after initial exposure to the index dog, the two owners, 21 employees from the small animal clinic and 21 employees from the Institute of Animal Pathology were interviewed about the degree of exposure (proximity and duration) to the index dog. The group of clinicians consisted of 21 females (5 veterinarians, 2 veterinary students, 13 animal nurses, 1 laboratory technician). The mean age was 30.04 years and the median age was 28 years (range 21–57 years). They were divided into two groups according to their level of exposure to the dog. Individuals in the high clinical exposure level group (n =3) had prolonged close contact with the diseased dog or intubated the animal. Those in the low clinical exposure level group (n =18) had short or no direct contact with the diseased dog and were present in the intensive care unit during the dog's hospital stay. At the Institute of Animal Pathology 14 females and 7 males with a mean age 36.4 years and a median age 32 years (range 19–62 years) were included in the investigation. Thirteen of these were veterinarians, two veterinary students, three necropsy prosectors and three histology technicians. They were divided into three groups. Pathologists in the high post-mortem exposure level group (n =3) performed the necropsy of the index case. Those in the medium post-mortem exposure level group (n =6) were present in the necropsy room during the hours following the necropsy. Those in the low post-mortem exposure level group (n =3) processed formalin fixed tissue specimens for histology. The no post-mortem exposure group (n =9) consisted of individuals who were not present in the necropsy room on the same day but on the following one to seven days of the necropsy. Additionally, information about history of TB exposure outside the veterinary hospital was collected to assess the likelihood of infection prior to contact with the index dog. This TB exposure history was stratified into three risk levels. High prior risk level (n =3): individuals with close contact to a human patient with active TB, those born and raised in a country with a TB incidence rate of >100/100,000, and those having travelled to or had a prolonged stay in a country with a TB incidence rate of >100/100,000. Medium prior risk level (n =9): individuals born and raised in a country with a TB incidence rate of <25/100,000 and a travel history to countries with a TB incidence rate of >50/100,000. Low prior risk level (n =30): individuals born and raised in a country with a TB incidence rate of <25/100,000 without the above mentioned exposure risks.   2.5 QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube assay and clinical investigation Blood samples from the owners and 42 veterinary personnel were taken and immediately analyzed using an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (Cellestis Ltd., Carnegie, Australia)). Analyses were run on an automated ELISA system (DSX, Ruwag, Switzerland). The status of the interferon-gamma (INF-?), released from sensitized lymphocytes upon stimulation with early secreted ESAT-6, culture-filtrate protein CFP-10, and protein TB7.7, was determined as recommended by the manufacturer (Stebler et al., 2008). The mitogen control was included in all cases, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Chest radiographs to exclude active TB were performed on each person with a positive test result.   2.6 Testing of contact animals in household Two clinically healthy cats, 15 and 3 years old, from the same household were tested for mycobacterial infection using IGRA (interferon-gamma release assay) as described previously (Rhodes et al., 2008). Briefly this assay evaluates the differential stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by bovine and avian tuberculins (PPDB, PPDA) and the mycobacterial antigens ESAT-6 and CFP10 (E/C). Additionally, two antibody detection assays were performed: the STAT-PAK TB rapid test® (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Medford, NY, USA) and the multi-antigen print immuno-assay (MAPIA) (Waters et al., 2006). The STAT-PAK rapid test detects antibodies to the mycobacterial antigens MPB83, ESAT-6 and CFP-10, while the MAPIA assay contains a broader range of mycobacterial antigens.  ",0
1349,S1995764516304655,Genetic association study of P2x7 A1513C (rs 3751143) polymorphism and susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis: A meta-analysis based on the findings of 11 case–control studies," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Identification and selection of pertinent studies The PubMed (Medline) and Google Scholar web-databases were searched systematically using the following key words in combination: P2x7 gene AND polymorphism OR mutation OR variant AND PTB to cover all the research articles published till December, 2015. The titles and abstracts of the selected studies were examined for their possible relevance to the genetic association between P2x7 and PTB. The studies matching our eligibility criteria were taken into account for this meta-analysis.   2.2 Selection criteria for inclusion and exclusion of the studies To decrease the heterogeneity and permit the correct interpretation of the results, the studies had to pass the below mentioned criteria: (1) the study should be evaluating the P2x7 A1513C A>C polymorphism and risk of pulmonary TB, (2) the study should be only the case–control study, (3) the study should have enrolled only clinically and pathologically confirmed PTB cases and disease-free controls, (4) the study should have distribution of genotype frequency available for both the cases and the controls, and (5) the study should be published in the English language. If the same case–control study was published by more than one article, we included only the study with highest number of subjects. The main reasons for the omission of the studies from the meta-analysis were: (1) studies with overlapping of the data, (2) studies reporting cases only, and (3) review articles.   2.3 Data mining and quality evaluation Two independent investigators assessed the methodological quality and extracted the data from all the selected research publications, individually, following a standard protocol. The accuracy of the data was determined by using a data-collection form as per our pre-set inclusion criteria. A third investigator was involved in discussion, in case of any disagreement on the retrieved data between the first two investigators, to reach a consensus. The following characters were noted from the selected studies: the first author's name with the year of publication, the country of origin, source of the study population and their numbers, study type, and genotype frequency distribution.   2.4 Statistical analysis of the data We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the relationship between the P2x7 1513A>C polymorphism and the risk of TB. The chi-square based Q-test was used to analyze the heterogeneity [22]. Lack of heterogeneity among the selected studies was revealed by Q-test significance level (P > 0.05). The fixed/random effects model [23,24] was employed to pool the ORs. To calculate the variability between studies (ranging between 0% and 100%, wherein, 0% suggests no observed heterogeneity and higher values specify rising degree of heterogeneity), I  2  statistics was used [25]. The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control group was assessed using chi-square test. The funnel plot asymmetry was calculated by Egger's linear regression test – a linear regression approach. The statistically significant publication bias was indicated when P-value was found to be less than 0.05 as determined by t-test [26]. The comprehensive meta-analysis software Version 2 from Biostat, NJ, USA was used to perform the complete statistical analysis. The comprehensive meta-analysis V2 has numerous positive features in comparison to other software programs available for performing meta-analyses. The comparison of these software programs can be done using the following web-link: http://meta-analysis.com/pages/comparisons.html.  ",0
1358,S1567134816300132,"The NRAMP1, VDR, TNF-?, ICAM1, TLR2 and TLR4 gene polymorphisms in Iranian patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: A case–control study"," 2 Methods  2.1 Cases and controls In this case–control study, 96 TB patients (56 men and 40 women) who had been subject to the treatment were recruited from Masih Daneshvari hospital, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD) and Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. Eligibility criteria for case patients included positive sputum smear or culture, or significant symptoms of typical pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and chest radiography consistent with active disease. All subjects agreed to take part in the study and informed consents were obtained from all subjects before blood sampling. Patients who had an additional disease such as diabetes mellitus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cancers, and consumers of corticosteroids drug, as well as non-Iranian patients were excluded. The mean age of patients was 51±31years. A control group composed of 122 (68 men and 54 women) unrelated individuals who were ethnically matched were also included in the analyses from the Laboratory Science Research Center of Iran University of Medical Science. None of the controls showed any clinical manifestations of PTB at the time of blood sample collection. The mean age of controls was 48±27years. Approximately 3ml of whole venous blood was collected in ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) tubes from each subject and DNA was extracted meanwhile.   2.2 Genotyping Genomic DNAs were isolated from whole blood using a salting-out method (Miller et al., 1988). The present study was conducted to determine the distribution of gene polymorphisms using single ARMS-PCR technique that has simultaneously genotyped fourteen polymorphisms. For the NRAMP1 gene; INT4 (469+14G/C a single nucleotide change in intron 4), D543N (an aspartic acid to asparagine substitution at codon 543 in exon 15), and 3?UTR (a TGTG deletion located at 55 nucleotides downstream of the last codon in exon 15) polymorphism sites were investigated (Soborg et al., 2002). We typed four VDR gene polymorphisms [defined by the presence of restriction endonuclease sites for FokI (F/f), BsmI (B/b), TaqI (T/t), and ApaI (A/a)] (Lombard et al., 2006; Søborg et al., 2007). For TNF-? gene, the polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the gene (?308G/A) were evaluated (Gupta and Sehajpal, 2003). For ICAM-1 gene, G241R and K469E polymorphisms were detected (Tajik et al., 2008). For TLRs, two functional effective polymorphisms for TLR2 (R677W, C?T; R753Q, G?A) and TLR4 (D299G, A?G; T399I, C?T) were investigated (Tajik et al., 2010). We concurrently typed fourteen gene polymorphisms in all subjects using our single ARMS-PCR technique. Sequences of specific and control primers, and amplicon size of each reaction are shown in Table 1 . The optimized PCR reaction condition consisted of 75ng of genomic DNA in 15?l of reaction mixture containing specific and control primer mixes (as shown in Table 1), 200?M of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 1X ammonium sulfate-based PCR buffer, 1.5–2.5mM MgCl2, and 0.6 unit Taq DNA polymerase (Cinnagen Inc., Tehran, Iran). The reaction was amplified by an Eppendorf gradient Mastercycler PCR system (Hamburg, Germany), which started with a heating temperature of 94°C for 2min, followed by ten cycles of 10s at 94°C and 60s at 65°C and 20cycles of 10s at 94°C, 50s at 61°C, and 30s at 72°C. The PCR products were analyzed in 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. For rapid performance, and to eliminate pipetting errors, primer mixes could be prealiquoted and dried in PCR plates or string tubes and then PCR mastermix plus sample genomic DNA and Taq polymerase were added.   2.3 Statistical analysis Data were managed and analyzed using SPSS (version 16.0). Comparisons of allele and genotype frequencies between patients and controls were examined by the chi-squared test with Yate's correction or Fisher's exact test. Corrected P values (Pc)?0.05 were considered statistically significant. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested for each SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphisms).  ",0
1365,S1067251614004591,Multifocal Bilateral Metatarsal Tuberculosis: A Rare Presentation," Case Report A 42-year-old female presented to the outpatient clinic of the orthopedic department with pain in bilateral feet in the region of the midfoot and swelling of the right foot over the first metatarsal. The pain had been present for the previous 6 months and had been recently aggravated, forcing the patient to seek medical attention. The pain had been insidious in onset and was localized to the region of the midfoot, with more pain on the medial side in the right foot and on the dorsum of the left foot diffusely. The pain was aggravated by prolonged standing and weightbearing and was relieved only mildly by rest and analgesics. The patient correlated the onset of pain in the right foot with a history of trivial trauma to the foot but reported no such incident for the left foot. She had a history of anorexia, although she had no documented weight loss. She had no history of fever or contact with a patient with TB. The examination of the foot showed a diffuse swelling over the medial aspect of the right foot. She had no local increase in temperature, and the swelling was tender on palpation. The swelling was bony hard in consistency. No associated discharging sinus or local erythema was present. The remainder of the pedal examination was normal. Although the patient complained of diffuse pain in the left foot, the examination of the midfoot at her presentation was unremarkable, except for local tenderness in the mid-dorsum of the left foot. The hematologic parameters were all normal, except for the presence of a markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 55 mm/h. The C-reactive protein test result was positive. The radiograph of the right foot demonstrated a definitive lytic lesion in the head and distal diaphysis of the first metatarsal with medullary destruction. No evidence of a periosteal reaction was apparent (Fig. 1 ). The radiograph of the left foot was grossly normal with no osteoporosis or lytic lesion found (Fig. 1). Because of the presence of pain, the diffuse swelling, and a lucent lytic lesion in the first metatarsal of the right foot, magnetic resonance imaging of the foot was performed. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of the foot demonstrated increased signal intensity of the marrow and surrounding soft tissue structures in both the coronal and sagittal images (Figs. 2 and 3  ). The cortex of the first metatarsal appeared thinned and possibly disrupted. No periosteal reaction was evident, nor was evidence seen of involvement of the articular surface. Considering the findings, the patient was scheduled for an open biopsy of the right first metatarsal. The patient was admitted for the biopsy 4 weeks after her presentation and primary radiograph and approximately 1 week after the magnetic resonance imaging study. The investigations at admission for biopsy included a chest radiograph, which did not show any signs of any focus of a tubercular lesion. On admission for the open biopsy, the patient reported an increase in pain in her left foot. Radiographs were obtained and demonstrated a lytic lesion in the proximal metaphysis and base of the third metatarsal. These findings had not been apparent on the previous radiographic workup (Fig. 4 ). An open biopsy was performed of the right first metatarsal. Evidence of cortical destruction was present. Also, the medullary bone, which was reached through a window in the cortical bone, revealed, on gross examination, white to dusky colored friable granulation tissue. This tissue was sent for Gram stain, acid fast bacillus stain, culture sensitivity, and histopathologic examination. The Gram stain and acid fast bacillus stain findings were negative. The histopathologic examination revealed a caseating granulomatous osteomyelitis and Langerhans' giant cell and epithelioid granuloma, which was highly suggestive of TB. At the suggestion of the pathologist and microbiologist, the tissue was sent for aerobic and acid fast bacillus cultures; however, the culture sensitivity results were all negative (Fig. 5 ). With the histopathologic findings suggestive of TB and demonstrating the presence of multifocal lesions, the possibility of a generalized immunocompromised etiology for the multifocal TB was considered. The patient was seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B-sAG, and hepatitis C. The patient was given isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine for a period of 2 months. This was followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide for 3 months and then isoniazid and rifampicin for 12 months. The patient was immobilized in bilateral below-the-knee casts for a 3-week period to allow adequate rest and to reinforce bed rest. The first sign of improvement was improvement of the pain in her feet. The radiograph at the first month follow-up visit showed persistence of the lesion in the left third metatarsal. However, the radiographs at the follow-up visits at 6 months and 1 year (Figs. 6 to 8   ) showed sequential improvement and healing of the lytic lesions. At the final follow-up visit at 24 months following treatment, both lesions had healed. ",0
1376,S0303846711004094,Adjuvant interferon-? treatment in two cases of refractory tuberculosis of the brain," 2 Case 1 A 44-year-old woman developed fever and headache and was diagnosed with TB meningitis at local hospital, where she started standard anti-TB therapy (see Table 1 ). The brain CT taken at that hospital was not remarkable, and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sensitive to all anti-TB drugs. Despite three months of treatment, she developed diplopia and mild left hemiparesis, at which time she was referred to our hospital. Initial CSF examination at our hospital showed white blood cell (WBC) count 180/mm3 (58% lymphocytes), protein 203mg/dL (normal range 15–45mg/dL) and glucose 48mg/dL (40–70mg/dL). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple tuberculomas in the brainstem (Fig. 1 A). Prior to contracting the disease, she had been healthy and repeated serologic tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. We increased the isoniazid dose from 300mg/day to 600mg/day and added streptomycin. At the same time, intravenous dexamethasone was administered but, no clinical improvement was noted. A second CSF exam performed four weeks after admission at our hospital, showed a WBC 50/mm3 (84% lymphocytes), protein level 138mg/dL and a glucose content of 55mg/dL. At this time, cycloserin, prothionamide, and ofloxacin were added. However, one week later, ptosis and nystagmus were aggravated and gait ataxia with lateropulsion developed. On the brain MRI taken at this time, tuberculomas in the brainstem had grown, although the edema extent had decreased slightly. With consideration of refractoriness to the anti-TB regimen, interferon-? (50?g/m2, subcutaneously, thrice weekly) was introduced. Two weeks after interferon-? introduction, the steroids were tapered off. After two months of interferon-? therapy, clinical improvement was noted. After six months of interferon-? therapy, the brainstem lesions were markedly decreased (Fig. 1B), as were the neurological symptoms and signs. At that time, interferon-? was discontinued, but anti-TB medications were continued for an additional 19 months (total treatment duration of 30 months). Her symptoms were completely resolved and there has been no evidence of clinical and radiological relapse during four years of follow-up after cessation of anti-TB therapy. ",0
1379,S0385814602001372,A case report of difficult diagnosis in the patient with advanced laryngeal tuberculosis," 2 Case report A 57-year-old male had presented with hoarseness since February 2001, but did not report fever or sore throat. He consulted our hospital in March 2001 due to continuing hoarseness. He reported using approximately 20 cigarettes per day for the previous 34 years. An examination with a flexible fiberscope revealed that the right false vocal cord was swollen with a nodular press, but that the true vocal cords were normal (Fig. 1 ). The results of a chest radiographic examination were normal. Other examination of the head and neck revealed them as normal. Full blood counts and electrolytes were within normal limits, but cross-reacting protein was elevated at 4.2 mg/dl and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 88 mm/h. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a mass in the right wing of the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 2 ), and in magnetic resonance imaging the abnormal mass presented a low intensity in a T1-weighted image and a high intensity in a T2-weighted image (Fig. 3 ). In addition, an invasive tumor was seen in the left portion of vertebral bodies of the middle and lower cervical spine (Fig. 4 ), which were very suggestive of metastatic lesions from malignant tumor. Blood tests, chest and abdomen CT scans, and upper gastric endoscopy were performed to detect the originating tumor. The overall result was of a soft-tissue mass in the left side of T6, and bony erosion of T7 of the thoracic spine, which continued between the spinal canal and pleura (Fig. 5 ). However, there was no abnormal lesion in the pulmonary field and upper digestive tract, and tumor markers were normal. The overall result was that it was not possible to detect the original malignant tumor. The patient was admitted and underwent a whole-body bone scan, involving 67Ga scintigraphy. Open biopsies were taken from the right wing of the thyroid cartilage by laryngo microsurgery under general anesthesia, and from the abnormal mass at T7 by subcutaneous incision under local anesthesia. Histopathologic examination revealed the epithelioid granuloma (Fig. 6 , left), and one of epithelioid granuloma associated with a Langhan's type polynucleated giant cell scattered in muscle tissues (Fig. 6, right), although without a caseating necrosis and a negative result with Ziehl–Nielsen stain. These results were strongly suggestive of LTB. Tests were performed on sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli and purified protein derivative (PPD) of tuberculin. The results of the PPD test were strongly positive: redness was 120×70 mm2 and cutaneous vesicle was 25×20 mm2; but the samples were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Therefore, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to confirm the diagnosis of TB. The patient was started on the following internal anti-TB medications at our hospital: isoniazid, 300 mg per day; ethambutol, 750 mg per day; rifampin, 450 mg per day; and pyrazinamide, 1200 mg per day. After 16 days of treatment, a bacillus of TB was naturally drained from the suture on his back, and detected by culture. The patient was transferred to another hospital, which is specialized in TB. The follow-up after treatment showed resolution of the hoarseness, and a CT scan confirmed the disappearance of the mass in the right wing of thyroid cartilage, although a bone defect was seen at the cervical spine, T6 and T7 in the thoracic spine. The laryngoscopy showed almost complete resolution of the inflammation seen in the larynx. These results demonstrated that all lesions associated with TB were improved by the anti-TB medications.

1399,S1755001709001031,A case of pulmonary tuberculosis accompanied with immune thrombocytopenic purpura," 2 Case report A 30-year-old woman was suffering from left chest pain. Two weeks after the onset, she was admitted to our hospital for detailed examination of abnormal chest shadows. In addition, purpura on her legs had lasted for 3 months before admission. On physical examination there were no abnormal findings except for the leg purpura. Her chest roentgenogram and computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple nodules and dissemination in the upper lob of the left lung (Fig. 1 ). Some of those nodules had formed cavitations. She was diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis because Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in her sputum. In addition, her platelet count was 1.9 × 104/mm3 on admission, serum platelet associated-immunoglobulin G (PA-IgG) was elevated to 266 ng/106cells (normal range: 5–25) and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow had increased to 222/mm3 (normal range: 50–150). Therefore she was also diagnosed as having immune thrombocytopenic purpura. However, splenomegaly was not detected, and IgG antibodies against Helicobacter pylori were negative. She was treated with anti-tubercular therapy composed of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethanbutol, and steroid therapy with high dose methylpredonisolone for three days was concurrently performed, resulting in gradual recovery of the platelet count (Fig. 2 ). After that, 30 mg of oral predonisolone (PSL) was also continued, and pyradinamide was added. Three months later, the platelet count was maintained above 15 × 104/mm3 and the tuberculosis lesions had also improved. The steroid was gradually reduced to 5 mg per two weeks and withdrawn 5 months later, and the anti-tubercular therapy for 9 months was finished. She has been free from relapse of both lung tuberculosis and thrombocytopenia for 2 years until now. PA-IgG was within normal limits after a year. ",0
1413,S0016510702736390,Colonic aphthoid erosions as the only manifestation of tuberculosis: Case report," Case report An 84-year-old previously healthy woman was hospitalized because of intermittent rectal bleeding. Examination revealed no abnormal findings. Laboratory evaluation included a positive fecal occult blood test and a positive tuberculin skin test. Chest radiograph disclosed no abnormal findings, but a barium enema demonstrated a few barium flecks in the ascending colon and an irregularly ulcerating tumor in the sigmoid colon. Colonoscopy disclosed an advanced cancer of the sigmoid colon and a few minute erosions of the ascending colon (Fig. 1A) that appeared to be oriented transversely.  Fig. 1   A, Colonoscopic view of small, transversely arranged, aphthoid lesions in ascending colon. B, Photomicrograph of biopsy specimen from aphthoid lesions showing noncaseous but well-formed epithelioid cell granulomas (H&E, orig. mag. ×20).    There were no typical endoscopic findings of intestinal tuberculosis such as a circumferential ulcer. Histopathologic evaluation of biopsy specimens from the erosions revealed no acid-fast bacilli (AFB), but granulomas were present (Fig. 1B). These were noncaseous but well-formed. The specific segments of DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were not detected in the biopsy specimens by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Culture of the specimen led to isolation of M tuberculosis 8 weeks later. No other pathogenic microorganisms were identified in cultures of the biopsy specimens or stool. Upper endoscopy, an upper GI radiograph series, and a double-contrast radiographic examination of the small bowel demonstrated no abnormal findings. Therefore, a tentative diagnosis of tuberculous colitis and a definite diagnosis of colonic cancer were made. After sigmoidectomy the patient was treated with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. Colonoscopy 1 month later demonstrated healing of the erosions in the ascending colon. At 2 years after treatment, there was no evidence of recurrent tumor or tuberculous colitis. ",0
1421,S0899707100001947,US and CT findings of tuberculosis of the thyroid: three case reports," 2 Case reports  2.1 Case 1 A 60-year-old woman was referred to the hospital on November 23, 1993 with a history of palpable neck mass for 10 days. She has not been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, hypertension or diabetes mellitus. She has received medication for hyperthyroidism since November 1992. On physical examination, there was a tender, hard, movable, oval-shaped mass on the right anterior neck, which was measured as about 2.0×2.0×2.0 cm3. There were general weakness, easy fatigability and palpitation. Chest radiography was normal. The white cell count of peripheral blood was normal and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was within normal range. Preoperative ultrasonogram (Fig. 1a)  showed a 1.5×2.0 cm2 sized, well-defined, round, heterogeneous, hypoechoic mass in the right thyroid gland. Color Doppler examination demonstrated vascular flow signals inside the tumor. Postcontrast CT (Fig. 1b) scan showed a round, central, low-density mass with peripheral enhancement in the right thyroid gland and several neck lymph nodes were visible. So we preoperatively diagnosed the condition as neoplastic lesion on the left thyroid gland. On December 1, 1993, the mass in the neck was explored by right total and left partial thyroidectomy. An ovoid-shaped tumor presented in the lower pole of left thyroid gland and measured about 1.5 cm in diameter. Its surface was irregular and somewhat hard in consistency. There was severe adhesion between the left lobe of the thyroid gland and the strap muscles. The specimen obtained by right total thyroidectomy was bisected. The center of the mass showed dark pigmentation with yellowish gray and irregular geographic necrosis (Fig. 1c). The remaining thyroid parenchyma was reddish brown and granular. Several lymph nodes in the neck were dissected. Microscopy of the right thyroid mass showed chronic granulomatous inflammation, consistent with tuberculosis. A few acid fast bacilli were noted on Ziehl–Neelson stain and anti-tuberculous medications were started.   2.2 Case 2 A 31-year-old woman was referred to the hospital with a history of headache and fever for 5 months on April 5, 1995. She has been diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis and received treatment consisting of anti-tuberculous medication and glucocorticoid. On physical examination, there was a tender, hard, fixed, bulging mass on the right anterior neck, which was measured as about 5.0×4.0×3.5 cm3. There were no signs of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Chest radiography showed active tuberculous inflammation on both lobes of both lungs. Precontrast and postcontrast CT (Fig. 2a and b)  scans showed a large, central, low-attenuation mass with peripheral enhancement in the right thyroid gland and several neck lymph nodes were visible. So we preoperatively diagnosed the condition as thyroid tuberculosis rather than neoplastic lesion. On April 14, 1995, the mass in the right thyroid was explored by left total lobectomy. An about 5.0×3.5×3.0 cm3-sized round tumor presented at the right lobe of the thyroid. It had extensive central caseation necrosis within the mass. There are severe adhesions between the left lobe of the thyroid gland and the adjacent soft tissue including strap muscles and it looked like acute inflammation. Several lymph nodes in the neck were dissected. Microscopy of the right thyroid lobe showed chronic granulomatous inflammation and caseation necrosis inside of the tumor, which suggest tuberculous infection. Before and after operation, anti-tuberculous medication was initiated.   2.3 Case 3 A 25-year-old woman was referred to the hospital on June 6, 1992 with a history of palpable mass in the left side of the neck for 1 month. She has not been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, hypertension or diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, there was a tender, hard, fixed, oval-shaped mass on the left anterior triangle of the neck, which was measured as about 3.0×3.0×2.0 cm3. There were no signs of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Chest radiography was normal. Preoperative ultrasonogram (Fig. 3)  showed a round, relatively heterogeneous, hypoechoic mass in the left thyroid gland The white cell count of peripheral blood was normal and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm/h. A thyroid scan showed a cold mass in the left lobe and no accumulation of radioactivity in the left lobe. So we preoperatively diagnosed the condition as neoplastic lesion on the left thyroid gland. On June 9, 1992, the mass in the neck was explored by left total lobectomy and isthmusectomy. A about 3.0×2.5×2.5 cm3-sized ovoid tumor presented at the left lobe of thyroid. It had nodular and irregular surface and somewhat hard in consistency. Its surface was whitish and gray-colored. Somewhat inflamed tissues surround the tumor and it looked like chronic inflammation. There was severe adhesion between the left lobe of the thyroid gland and the strap muscles. Several lymph nodes in the neck were dissected. Microscopy of the left thyroid lobe showed chronic granulomatous inflammation and caseation necrosis inside and outside the tumor, which suggest tuberculous infection. Two weeks after operation, treatment with isoniazid and streptomycin was initiated.  ",0
1423,S2212553115001375,"Diabetes mellitus and its influence on sputum smear positivity at the 2nd month of treatment among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: A case control study"," Materials and methods This study was carried out as an unmatched case–control study within June 2010 to September 2010.  Study population This study was conducted at the tuberculosis clinic at the Institute of Respiratory Medicine (IPR), which is located at Jalan Pahang, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This institute provides outpatient clinics (2times/wk; Monday and Thursday) and inpatient services to patient with tuberculosis, as well as patients with other serious respiratory diseases. The sampling population of this study was all smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients with persistence of positivity after 2months of intensive treatment who registered at the IPR from December 2009 to June 2010. Purposive sampling was applied in enrolling cases and controls in this study. Patients were included as a case if they were initially diagnosed of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis with clinical and/or bacteriological evidence, tested positive with microscopic sputum smear investigation (at least 2 acid-fast bacilli positive) at the end of the 2nd month of intensive antituberculosis treatment, aged ?20years, able to understand and communicate wisely in Malay language, willing to participate in the study, and had signed the consent form. However, those who were initially diagnosed of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis with clinical and/or bacteriological evidence, and tested negative using microscopic sputum smear investigation at the end of the 2nd month of intensive antituberculosis treatment were included as controls for this study. Those who were not registered with the IPR, diagnosed with another form of tuberculosis such as extra pulmonary tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus positive, pregnant women, terminally ill at which restricting them to give full cooperation, did not do their sputum smear examination after 2months of intensive treatment with doubtful smear results, or, unwilling to participate were excluded from this study.   Study instruments Data was collected using three instruments: (1) structured self-administered questionnaires; (2) patients’ records; and (3) anthropometric measurements. The administered questionnaire was used to assess the participants sociodemographic information, treatment related factors, and their smoking habit. Next, patients’ records were used to obtain information regarding laboratory results of sputum smear after 2months of treatment of each participant, their diabetes status, treatment regime, and adherence to treatment. As for the anthropometric measurement, two scales, namely Seca bellissima 841 digital weighing scale (with 0.1kg level of accuracy) and Seca bodymeter microtoidse tape (Seca Medizinische Waagen und Messsysteme Vogel & Halke GmbH & Co, Hamburg, Germany) (error of measurement of ±0.1cm), were used in measuring body weight and height, respectively. Body mass index was calculated based on these two readings.   Data collection procedure Before the researcher started to collect data from the respondents, cases and controls were met during their follow-up; which is on Monday or Thursday. The researcher approached the eligible patients nicely and they were given an explanation regarding the study. Nothing was done before the patients signed the consent form. After they agreed, each participant’s body weight and height were measured following the standardized technique. Measurements were carried out by the researcher herself. During the measurements, the participant was asked to wear light clothes, no shoes, and to stand straight with both hands at the body side. In order to avoid measurement bias, readings were taken twice and only the average was used. The body mass index was classified according to clinical practice guidelines on the management of obesity, Ministry of Health Malaysia (2004) [5]. Next, the researcher gave a set of questions to be answered by the participants. This was a self-administered questionnaire and each of the patients were given about 10min to answer all the questions with researcher supervision.   Statistical analysis Data were entered and analyzed by using the SPSS version 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were presented as descriptive statistics either as mean, median, standard deviation, frequencies, or percentages. Differences and associations between categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square test. Student t test or Mann–Whitney U test (for data which were not normally distributed) were used to compare the differences in means of continuous variables. Multiple logistic regressions with forward stepwise strategy was used in assessing the association between the risk factors (independent variables) and the outcome of sputum smear conversion after 2months of intensive treatment, statistically adjusted for potential confounding effects of other covariates. A p value <.05 was used as the level of significance.   Ethical considerations This study was conducted on a voluntary basis whereby every patient has their own right to participate or withdraw from the study. Oral and written information in Bahasa Melayu were provided to all participants prior to obtaining informed oral and written consent. All data were kept confidential for academic purposes only. Also, ethical approval and formal permission was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Faculty of Medicine, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and the director of IPR, accordingly. This study was also registered with the National Malaysian Research Registry.  ",0
1429,S1755001711000790,Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and superinfection with pulmonary tuberculosis in a case," 2 Case report A 46-year-old, life long non-smoker male was admitted to the hospital with the complaints of dyspnea, cough and fever. He had fatigue, non-productive cough and progressive dyspnea during two months and fever for a week. He is working as a welder. His medical history was normal. Physical examination revealed the bilateral fine crackles. The purulent sputum was present. Chest roentgenogram demonstrated the bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities with paracardiac non-homogenous opacity on right hemithorax (Fig. 1 A). The hemoglobin value was 10.1, peripheral blood leukocyte count was 12,000 cell/cu mm and erythrocytes sedimentation rate was 60 mm/h. Arterial blood gas values during room-air breathing revealed that the pH: 7.52, pO2: 60 mmHg, pCO2: 24 mmHg and SaO2: 94%. Other laboratory values were normal. Thorax CT revealed the bilateral ground-glass opacities associated with thickened interlobular septa, called to as “crazy paving” pattern (Fig. 2 ). Also, alveolar consolidation was observed on right middle lobe. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed the hyperemic bronchial mucosa. AFB-staining and cytological examination of bronchial lavage fluids were negative and benign, respectively. Transbronchial biopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination of transbronchial biopsy showed the alveolar spaces filled with granular eosinophilic materials which were Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive (Fig. 3 ). The patient wanted to get discharged on 2nd day of hospitalization and he did not want to receive any treatment. Ten days later, he was admitted to the hospital with fever. Chest radiograph on second admission was similar to the first admission. The direct smear of the sputum showed acid-fast bacilli with AFB-staining. The culture of previously taken bronchial lavage fluid grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antituberculosis treatment combined with regimen of isoniazid, morfozinamid, rifampicin and ethambutol was started. The symptomatic and radiologic improvements were observed after the treatment (Figs. 1A and 4 ). ",0
1432,S2212553114000338,Evaluation of the Indian TrueNAT micro RT-PCR device with GeneXpert for case detection of pulmonary tuberculosis," Methods  Ethics This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Waiver of consent was obtained by the IRB, as the study was carried out on left-over banked specimens identified by a laboratory generated number with no traceability to the patients. The TrueNAT MTB/GeneXpert results were not used in clinical decision making.   Settings Sample collection, Smear Microscopy, MGIT culture and GeneXpert was performed at Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre, Mumbai. The TB lab is accredited with the College of American Pathologist (CAP), National Accreditation Board for Laboratories (NABL) and Central TB Division, Governmet of India (CTD, GOI) for liquid culture and DST. It is the referral laboratory for TB. Real-time PCR and TrueNAT MTB tests were performed by trained Hinduja hospital staff at Bigtec Labs, Bangalore.   Study population and specimens This was a blinded study to determine the performance of the TrueNAT in patients with symptoms of pulmonary TB in comparison with conventional methodologies (smear and culture) and GeneXpert. Sputum specimens were collected from patients presenting routinely to hospital with suspected pulmonary TB. Standard diagnostic follow-up (smear, culture, GeneXpert) was performed on all patients. Left-over sputum specimens were tested using TrueNAT. A total of 274 (n =274) sputum samples were collected from patients suspected of having TB (Fig. 3 ).   Laboratory work-up of sputum specimens  Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) smear: Direct and concentrated acid-fast bacillus (AFB) microscopy (ZN staining) was performed and specimens were graded as per WHO recommended criteria, followed by sputum processing with 2% N-acetyl-l-cysteine and sodium hydroxide (NALC–NaOH) and centrifugation [14,15]. The re-suspended pellet was subjected to cultivation on liquid medium MGIT, supplied by Becton Dickinson. Digested and decontaminated (2% NALC–NaOH) sputum specimens that were culture negative for mycobacterium and confirmed “Non-TB” by sequencing were pooled for use as a negative control. A suspension of M. tuberculosis H37RV was prepared in sterile saline and adjusted to the density of a 1.0 McFarland standard. The suspension was diluted 1:10 in saline and used to spike the pooled above-mentioned negative control and used as a positive control. Spiked specimens were stored at ?70°C until further processing.   TrueNAT MTB test  DNA extraction using Trueprep-MAG protocol Untreated sputum specimens were processed as per manufacturer’s instructions of Trueprep-MAG Sputum kit with a starting volume of 500?l being added to the sample pre-treatment tube [13].   Real-time PCR on chip 5?l of DNA extracted added to the TrueNAT MTB microchip containing lyophilized mastermix and the real-time PCR was done using a pre-programmed profile on the device. Results were observed on the screen. The lyophilized mastermix included proprietary primers and a probe specific to the M. tuberculosis.   Real-time PCR on ABI 7500 PCR reactions were run using the DNA extracted using the Trueprep-MAG protocol. 4?l of extracted DNA was mixed with 6?l of the TrueNAT MTB mastermix and real-time PCR was performed on real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) under the following cycling conditions: 1min at 95°C and 45 cycles of 10s at 95°C and 34s at 58°C.   Buffers, reagents and mastermixes All buffers and reagents used for nucleic acid extraction and all mastermixes used for PCR are proprietary constituents of the Trueprep-MAG Sputum and TrueNAT MTB kit.    Xpert MTB/RIF The assay was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions [5].   Statistical analysis Evaluation of the TrueNAT MTB test was performed in comparison with the other molecular methods for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA from sputum, following the STARD recommendations [16]. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, and Negative Predictive Value, were calculated by using the http://www.vassarstats.net/ and MedCalc software online clinical calculator.  ",0
1437,S0041134507011086,Diagnosis and Treatment for Tuberculosis Infection in Liver Transplant Recipients: Case Reports," Materials and Methods One hundred ten liver transplantations have been performed in our center from 2000 to 2006 including 2 cases of TB infection with a 1.8% mobidity rate.  Case 1 A 32-year-old man received a liver transplant for hepatitis B–related disease and hepatic encephalopathy. A preoperative chest radiograph was normal. The postoperative immunosuppressive protocol consisted of Cyclosporine (CsA), steroid (intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg/d tapered to a maintenance dose of 20 mg/d on the 7th day) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 1.5 g/d). The postoperative course was uneventful for the first 3 weeks. However, 25 days after the operation, the patient experienced fever to 38°C and weight loss. The white blood cell count increased to 10.8 × 109/L and the chest radiograph showed a miliary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. Computed tomography of the chest demonstrated multiple nodules in the left lung and bilateral pleural fluid. Purified protein derivative (PPD) testing and sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli were both negative. Pleural fluid culture showed Corynebacteria. With administration of an appropriate antibiotic, the white blood cell count decreased to normal. However, fever persisted. Tentative antituberculous drugs—Ofloxacin, Isoniazid, Rifapentine, and Ethambutal—were prescribed at 40 days after transplantation. The temperature became normal after 4 days of treatment. During the period of the treatment, the liver function showed slightly increased ALT and decreased CsA level. Liver biopsy revealed mild rejection. The dose of CsA was adjusted to the therapeutic window, and liver function recovered gradually. By 4 months after treatment, the pleural fluid was absorbed and the lesions in the upper lobe of the left lung diminished. At 6 months after the treatment, computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed disappearance of the multiple nodules. At the same time, Ethambutal and ofloxacin were stopped. Isoniazid and Rifapentine were continued for 3 months thereafter. The patient has been followed for 2 years with no evidence of recurrence.   Case 2 A 50-year-old man underwent liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis. He had no history of tuberculous disease. His preoperative chest X-ray and CT revealed no abnormalities. The patient’s recovery was uneventful after the operation he was discharged at 30 days after surgery. The postoperative immunosuppression include FK506, MMF, and prednisone. At 4 months after the operation, he showed intermittent fever and a temperature that fluctuated between 38°–39°C. The patient complained of depression, poor appetite, and weight loss. The white blood cell count increased to 9.0–10.5 × 109/L. The chest X-ray was normal at that time. The sputum culture showed Staphylococcus aureus; Imipenem was prescribed. However, the fever persisted (37.5°–38°C). The PPD test was negative. At 5 months after surgery, a high fever (38°–40°C) occurred in the patient. The abdominal CT demonstrated lymphadenectasis in the retroperitoneum, which appeared in the right neck over the following days. The patient complained of cough at the same time. The chest X-ray showed an exudative process. The diagnosis was confirmed using lymph node biopsy performed on the neck, which revealed granulomas. Acid fast smear of the purulence indicated acid fast bacilli. The sputum TB culture was negative during the process. Antituberculous therapy was commenced with Ofloxacin, Isoniazid, Rifapentine, and Ethambutal. The patient was apyrexic after 6 days of treatment. Ofloxacin was stopped after 3 months of therapy. The patient had elevated ALT and bilirubin levels 3 months after the treatment. Liver biopsy confirmed drug-induced toxicity. The dose of Isoniazid was reduced and the liver function recovered gradually. Ethambutal was stopped after 6 months of therapy. Isoniazid and Rifapentin were continued for the following 3 months. The patient remained asymptomatic 4 months after the termination of antituberculous therapy.  ",0
1439,S1477513109005245,Non-healing sinus on the back: A rare presentation of genitourinary tuberculosis," Case report A 5-year-old girl presented to the surgical outpatient department with complaints of a non-healing sinus on her back situated at the left renal angle. The patient reported no urological symptoms and had not suffered from tuberculosis in the past or had contact with a patient suffering from tuberculosis. The general examination was normal. On clinical examination, she was found to have a sinus located at the left renal angle which was fixed to the underlying tissues (Fig. 1 ). There was no discharge from the sinus. Surrounding skin was normal. On per abdominal examination, the left kidney was palpable as a lump. The liver and spleen were also palpable. The rest of the systemic examination was normal. With the clinical diagnosis of renal tuberculosis, the patient was subjected to further investigations. Routine hematological investigations showed a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate with normal counts. Urine examination was normal. The three consecutive early morning urine samples did not show acid-fast bacilli and urine culture was negative for acid-fast bacilli. The chest radiograph was normal. The renal function tests were normal. X-ray of the kidney–ureter–bladder region showed extensive calcification in the left renal area (Fig. 2 ). Intravenous pyelogram showed a non-functioning left kidney with extensive parenchymal calcification. The right-side renal unit was unaffected and showed normal and prompt excretion of the contrast. Right ureter and bladder were normal. During her time in hospital, the patient developed tubercular synovitis of the left knee joint. She was put on multidrug antitubercular treatment (isoniazide, rifampin, pyrizinamide). Under cover of antitubercular therapy, the child underwent a left nephroureterectomy. There was no macroscopic evidence of viable renal tissue. Histopathology confirmed tuberculosis of the left kidney with calcification (Fig. 3 ). Postoperatively, the child received antitubercular treatment for a full 9 months (isoniazide, rifampin, pyrizinamide for 2 months, isoniazide, rifampin for 7 months). At the end of the treatment, an intravenous pyelogram was repeated and a cystoscopy was performed, and these were both normal. The child when seen 36 months after completion of antitubercular therapy was doing extremely well and was free of disease. ",0
1450,S1201971215002301,Early culture conversion and cure for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is possible with appropriate treatment: lessons learnt from a case study in South Africa," 2 Case report  2.1 TB history and management In May 2003, the patient – a female aged 44 years – presented to her local clinic in the Western Cape Province of South Africa with symptoms of coughing and weight loss. She tested HIV-negative. She smoked and used alcohol intermittently during the initial years of treatment, but subsequently stopped. The patient was treated under the DOTS-Plus programme. 5   Following diagnosis of TB with a positive smear, the patient was started on first-line treatment (Figure 1). Sputum was taken and tested against isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. The results became available in July 2003 and showed the patient to have MDR-TB. She was referred to an MDR in-patient facility, some 300km away from her home, in line with the DOTS-Plus protocol. The patient was started on the standardized, weight-based MDR-TB treatment regimen in July 2003 (Figure 1) and was treated according to the DOTS-Plus guidelines. 5  This consisted of a 4–6-month intensive phase of pyrazinamide, ethambutol, ethionamide, ofloxacin, and amikacin/kanamycin. Pyrazinamide and amikacin/kanamycin were then stopped, and the remaining drugs continued for 12–18 months. Due to the repeated demonstration of resistance to ethambutol in this woman, an individualized regimen was started in November 2003: clofazimine and terizidone were added and pyrazinamide was continued. Amikacin/kanamycin was given for a total of 8 months. On admission, the patient weighed 47kg (having put on 5kg since diagnosis). After 2 months of inpatient care, the subject was still sputum smear-positive and culture-positive. She had, however, gained a further 3kg and was discharged to continue ambulatory treatment at a clinic close to her home. She was followed-up on a 2-monthly basis by a clinician-based outreach team. The patient was declared a treatment failure in October 2005 after 24 months of treatment, and terizidone was stopped. The other three drugs – ethionamide, pyrazinamide, and ofloxacin – were continued while sensitivity testing to second-line drugs was attempted. When the patient's weight dropped to 46kg in April 2008, she was readmitted to the MDR-TB inpatient facility where a capreomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid-based regimen was initiated. These drugs have low efficacy against TB and only became available for the treatment of XDR-TB in South Africa in 2007. 3  Clarithromycin and amoxicillin–clavulanate, also drugs without proven efficacy against TB, were used to bolster the regimen and terizidone was reintroduced. The patient converted to sputum culture-negative within 71 days. In February 2011 she was declared cured and treatment was stopped. She was subsequently followed up by the clinical outreach team until the end of April 2013 with no recurrence of the TB. As early as July 2005 it was determined that this patient was not a candidate for surgery due to bilateral disease. In October 2011, after a massive haemoptysis, she was seen by a pulmonologist who reported that her lung functions were poor. A six-minute walk test showed the pre-stress test at 92% and post-stress test at 77%. She also had extensive bronchiectasis and impaired respiratory reserves. At this time a Mycobacterium abscessus (non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM)) was cultured from her sputum. She did not attend any more of her scheduled appointments possibly due to the distance in travelling to the specialist centre.   2.2 Sputum results As per guidelines, monthly sputa were collected for microscopy and culture. These exhibited a low bacterial load on microscopy, although cultures remained positive and contaminated, resulting in very few follow-up sensitivity results available to guide treatment. Under the DOTS-Plus programme, sputa were collected and batched for second-line drug sensitivity testing. 5  The results were not reported back for clinical management partly due to the lack of drugs for the implementation of individualized regimens. In 2006, with the advent of and defining of XDR-TB, the DOTS-Plus sputum results were investigated retrospectively to determine the occurrence of XDR-TB. The present patient's July 2004 sputum was used for sensitivity testing, demonstrating resistance to the following second-line drugs: amikacin/kanamycin, ofloxacin, and ethionamide. This information was only added to her file in 2007, but due to inherent challenges in obtaining second-line drug susceptibility testing, this result was not confirmed until September 2007 (Figure 1). The ongoing isolation of NTM from her sputum was deemed to be of no clinical relevance and did not warrant further investigations or treatment.   2.3 Drug side effects Side effects were monitored passively, 5  and the patient experienced few side effects. She started complaining of skin hyperpigmentation at 4 months after the start of clofazimine, and this was eventually stopped after 8 months when the patient complained of unacceptable levels of skin discolouration. She experienced minor side effects due to the para-aminosalicylic acid and admitted to the treating physician that she only took it in the morning as the night dose made her “feel bloated”. In March 2009, both clarithromycin and pyrazinamide were stopped due to arthralgia. Despite experiencing these side effects, she was by her own account adherent with the community-based treatment.

1456,S0090301905007779,Unusual presentations of craniovertebral junction tuberculosis: a report of 2 cases and literature review," 2 Case 1 A 21-year-old woman presented with a history of intermittent right ear discharge since childhood. For the past 2 months, the patient had mild right-sided otalgia, hearing loss, and pulsatile tinnitus that was not accompanied by dizziness or vertigo. There was no facial asymmetry. There was severe neck pain, restricting all neck movements, and torticollis. On otologic examination, there was thin odorless discharge and the tympanic membrane was thickened and showed a single central perforation, through which a multiloculated mass was protruding externally, obscuring all tympanic membrane landmarks. There was a 2-cm single palpable lymph node in right posterior triangle of neck. Pure-tone audiometry revealed right-sided mixed hearing loss. High-resolution CT of temporal bone and CVJ was done (Figs. 1-3   ). A moderately enhancing heterogenous soft tissue mass was seen, involving the right basiocciput, extending to the right jugular fossa and posterior styloid space. There was bony erosion of basiocciput and petrous bone on the right side. The right condylar process and right lateral mass of atlas were also eroded. The fat planes at the attachment of longus colli with basiocciput were lost. Soft tissue density was seen in the right mastoid air cells, right middle ear cavity, and right external auditory canal. The right atlanto-occipital joint space was decreased, and the articular margins were irregular. This had led to translatory subluxation at the atlantoaxial joint (Figs. 1-3). Contrast-enhanced MRI showed fluid collections in paravertebral region. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the cervical lymph node showed granulomatous inflammation and caseation necrosis, but was negative for acid-fast bacilli. The pathological examination of granulation tissue from external auditory canal also revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseation. Acid-fast bacilli could be isolated from this tissue. Workup for pulmonary tuberculosis in the form of chest radiograph and sequential sputum examination was negative. This patient (42 kg) was managed with full-dose antitubercular chemotherapy (isoniazid 300 mg/d, rifampicin 450 mg/d, ethambutol 800 mg/d, and pyrazinamide 1500 mg/d) for 18 months and a hard cervical collar for external immobilization. Within 2 weeks of starting chemotherapy, patient showed a remarkable recovery, with relief of neck musculature spasm and disappearance of otologic complaints. Follow-up CT scan of the CVJ demonstrated evidence of healing in form of disappearance of the soft tissue mass and sclerosis of bony margins (Figs. 4-7    ). ",0
1482,S1567134810000717,"First case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis caused by a rare “Beijing-like” genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Bogotá, Colombia"," 2 Materials and methods Sputum samples from a 15-year-old female patient diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) were received at the Mycobacteria Laboratory of the School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, for bacteriological confirmation of the disease. Later, these were followed by various tissue samples (lung, kidney, adrenal glands, brain, and heart) upon the autopsy of the same patient after she died. Specimens were processed and cultured, followed by bacterial identification using standard mycobacteriological procedures (Kent and Kubica, 1985). In total, 3 cultures from lung (strain 091), adrenal glands (strain 093), and kidney (strain 094), and 2 cultures from sputum (strains 254 and 255) were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex using catalase at room temperature, catalase at 68°C, nitrate reduction and the niacin test. Drug susceptibility testing to 4 first-line drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and streptomycin) was performed using the 1% proportion method (Canetti et al., 1969). DNA was extracted and subjected to molecular typing using spoligotyping (Kamerbeek et al., 1997), 12-loci MIRU typing (Supply et al., 2001) and IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PvuII-digested bacterial DNAs (van Embden et al., 1993). For IS6110-RFLP, M. tuberculosis H37Rv was used as control while a mixture of PvuII-digested supercoiled DNA ladder and HaeII-digested ?X174 DNA was run as a ladder (Lari et al., 1999). Spoligotypes in binary format were converted to an octal code for comparison with the SITVIT2 proprietary database of the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe. SITVIT2 is an updated proprietary version of the previously released SpolDB4 database (Brudey et al., 2006). At the time of the present study, SITVIT2 contained genotyping information on about 70,000 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from 160 countries of origin. In this database, Spoligotype International Type (SIT) and MIRU International Type (MIT) designate spoligotypes and MIRU patterns shared by 2 or more patient isolates, respectively, whereas “orphan” designates patterns reported for a single isolate. The potential evolution of the SIT190 strains was studied by drawing a minimum spanning tree (MST) of available MIRU patterns in the SITVIT2 database (Bionumerics software version 3.5, Applied Maths, Sint-Marteen-Latem, Belgium).

1500,S157921291300150X,Experience of a Monographic Tuberculosis Unit: The First 500 Cases," Materials and Methods  Design Descriptive study conducted in HSLL, a 350-bed hospital serving some 250000 residents of an urban-rural area of Mallorca, of whom around 43000 (17.2%) are immigrants. The study was approved by the center's research committee.   Patients All TB cases diagnosed in the HSLL during the period January 2003–December 2011 were included.   Methods In 2003, the HSLL opened a multidisciplinary (Internal Medicine, Respiratory Medicine, Pediatrics and Nursing) single-specialty TB clinic. In this one-stop clinic, suspected cases of tuberculous disease referred from health centers or the Emergency Department are studied on an outpatient basis, patients diagnosed with TB are followed-up after discharge, and household contacts are studied. At the first visit, laboratory tests, chest radiograph, sputum culture, a tuberculin test (TT) 8  and Quantiferon-TB-Gold In-Tube 9  (QFT-G-IT) assay are also carried out (the latter performed on most patients as of 2008), in addition to anamnesis and a physical examination. Bronchoscopy is performed when indicated. At the second visit, 48–72h after the first, the TT is read and other additional tests are interpreted, initiating treatment when indicated, both for tuberculous disease and infection.  Diagnosis of Tuberculosis As per the clinical definition, a patient was considered to have TB when she/he had signs or symptoms consistent with tuberculous disease in the absence of any other disease that could explain them, and they responded to pharmacological TB treatment. The case was confirmed bacteriologically when it met laboratory diagnostic criteria, i.e., isolation in culture of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex microorganism, or, if unable to perform said culture, with the demonstration of acid-fast bacilli by microscopy in a suitable clinical sample. A case was considered to be not bacteriologically confirmed when it met the criteria for clinical case definition but did not meet laboratory diagnostic criteria. 10      Clinical and Epidemiological Data Patient medical records were reviewed retrospectively, and the following information was collected: sociodemographic data (age, sex, and country of origin), substance abuse (smoking, drinking considered as consumption of more than 30g of alcohol per day and intravenous drug use), comorbidities (diabetes, neoplasms, and HIV infection), diagnostic method and sample, treatment prescribed, anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility, toxicities, treatment adherence and final outcome.   Statistics The descriptive statistical analysis included median and range for continuous variables, and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. The quantitative variables were compared using the Student's t-test; the Chi-square test was used for the qualitative variables when they met the applicable criteria. The difference was considered statistically significant when P<.05. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to estimate the risk. The time course was studied by calculating the linear trend using the least squares method. Computer applications SPSS Statistics 18® and Epidat 3.1® were used for the statistical analyses.  ",0
1503,S0188440904000967,Extrapulmonary tuberculosis: clinical and epidemiologic spectrum of 636 cases," Materials and methods  Study population Records of 2,533 cases referred between 1996 and 2000 to dispensaries in the Kocaeli region and diagnosed with tuberculosis were reviewed retrospectively; of these, 775 EPTB cases were determined. Some files could not be obtained (due to relocation outside the region, death, lack of records, etc.); as a result, only 636 EPTB cases for whom records were available were included in this study.   Study design World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were used for case definition (9). Accordingly, cases having clinical evidence of tuberculosis only in extrapulmonary organs were classified as EPTB. This evidence was supported in a fraction of cases by histologic or bacteriologic findings, positive tuberculin test, and favorable response to treatment. However, cases with active tuberculosis of lung parenchyma or patients who had lung parenchyma involvement in addition to extrapulmonary region were diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis and were excluded from the study (9). According to the WHO (9), cases were subdivided into severe and less severe EPTB cases. The following forms of EPTB are classified as severe: meningitis; miliary; pericarditis; peritonitis; bilateral or extensive pleural effusion; spinal; intestinal, and genitourinary, while the following forms were classified as less severe: lymph node; unilateral pleural effusion; bone (except spine); peripheral joint, and skin. If more than one region was involved, classification was made taking the most severely affected region into account. In pleural tuberculosis, clinical diagnosis was supported by one or more of the following findings: detection of tuberculosis bacilli in pleural fluid smear and culture; granulomatous inflammation displaying caseification necrosis in histopathologic examination after pleural biopsy, and in cases in which biopsy could not be carried out, detection of pleural fluid exudate, predominance of lymphocytes, and expression of adenosine deaminase enzyme (ADA) in the fluid. In lymph node tuberculosis, clinical diagnosis was strengthened by one or more of the following findings: positive culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and granulomatous inflammation with caseification necrosis by needle aspiration or node excision, while in hilar or mediastinal lymph node tuberculosis, clinical diagnosis was strengthened by close contact with persons with tuberculosis, positive PPD test, and favorable response to treatment. In these cases, classification was made according to location of node. Tuberculin test in dispensaries is carried out intradermally (i.d.) to the upper one third of dorsal aspect of left forearm with a 26-g needle 0.1 mL PPD (5 IU). Horizontal diameter of the enduration formed is measured 72 h after injection. As stated in the Turkish National Guide, in persons without BCG vaccination, scar enduration with a diameter of 10 mm or more is considered positive. In individuals with BCG scar, diameter of 5–14 mm is attributed to BCG, and >15 mm is regarded as positive and evaluated as infection. For the 636 EPTB cases whose file records could be obtained, microbiologic, radiologic, and histopathologic findings were investigated. Age and sex breakdown, status of contact with active tuberculosis cases, BCG scar status, results of tuberculin test, disease localization, diagnostic procedures, and treatment duration were reviewed.   Statistical analysis Chi-square test was used in statiscal analysis to determine significance of the relationship among features; p value ?0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.  ",0
1511,S2212553115000710,"Factors associated with treatment success and death in cases with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Bulgaria, 2009–2010"," Materials and methods The data for the MDR-TB cases starting treatment during the period September 2009–March 2010 were obtained from the patient medical records held at the Hospital for Lung Diseases in Gabrovo, in central Bulgaria, as well as the TB registers of the NRL-TB at the NCIPD in Sofia. The essential demographic, clinical and microbiological data were entered on an electronic database. The definitions used in this study for case registration, sputum-smear microscopy and culture, and treatment outcomes of the cases with MDR-TB and XDR-TB conformed to those recommended by the WHO [3,10].  Patient treatment The MDR-TB patients described in this study were placed on an individualized regimen composed of an initial phase containing a second-line injectable which lasted a minimum of 6months and at least 4months after culture conversion, followed by a longer continuation phase which lasted for 12months after the initial culture conversion. The composition of the regimens included combinations of the following drugs: pyrazinamide, ethambutol (in cases with confirmed sensitivity to the drug), an injectable agent (kanamycin or capreomycin), levofloxacin, and prothionamide, p-amino salicylic acid and cycloserine. Regimens were modified based on the history of drugs previously taken by the patient. The aim was to administer at least four drugs with either certain or almost certain effectiveness, as well as pyrazinamide. Drug dosages were modified according to body weight. All the drugs for treatment of MDR/XDR-cases and for treatment of adverse drug effects were free of charge for the patients. The patients were hospitalized for a different period at the start of the second-line therapy. All doses received in hospital and in the ambulatory were given under direct observation (DOT). During the continuation phase, DOT was organized through a national network of regional TB managers and patronage nurses, primary health care staff (general practitioners, nurses and medical specialists) for patients living in the remote areas, and NGO representatives working with groups at risk of TB. In order to encourage adherence to treatment, food vouchers were handed to MDR-TB patients during the full course of treatment, when they presented for their treatment encounters.   Laboratory tests Smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were examined by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. All cultures were carried out with conventional Löwenstein–Jensen solid media and by liquid media using BACTEC MGIT960® automated system. DST of the strains was performed in the NRL-TB by applying the reference BACTEC MGIT960® automated system following the recommendations provided by the manufacturer (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA). DST to FLDs was performed using the commercial SIRE kit for FLDs with critical concentration of the drugs as follows: streptomycin – 1.0?g/ml; isoniazid – 0.1?g/ml; rifampicin – 1.0?g/ml; ethambutol – 5?g/ml. Isolated strains with resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin from 47 MDR-TB patients (out of all 50 patients starting treatment) were tested against SLDs. DST to SLDs was performed by BACTEC MGIT960® with critical concentration of the drugs as follows: amikacin – 1.0?g/ml; kanamycin – 5.0?g/ml; capreomycin – 2.5?g/ml; and ofloxacin – 2.0?g/ml. Sputum-smear microscopies and cultures were conducted on a monthly basis to monitor the response to treatment in the laboratory in Gabrovo hospital during the intensive phase of treatment, and in the respective laboratories at the regional TB health facilities during the continuation (ambulatory) phase. HIV-ELISA tests were used to determine HIV-status at the beginning of treatment.   Statistical analyses Student t-test was performed to compare continuous variables between different subpopulations. Bivariate analysis was used to explore independent associations between several factors and treatment outcomes (success and death); a P-value smaller than 0.05 was considered to represent a statistically significant association. A multivariable analysis was performed to model the determinants of success and death in logistic regression equations, using only variables in which an association with a P-value <0.15 was observed at bivariate analysis. All analyses were performed using R [11].   Ethical issues The cases with MDR/XDR-TB included in this cohort were treated under standard conditions of patient care in the Republic of Bulgaria, that the treatment was not of an experimental nature and that it conformed to the treatment composition, duration and major ethical considerations associated with TB as recommended by WHO [2,3,12]. All the patients completed informed consent forms for the treatment with SLDs and that all measures were taken to ensure that patient confidentiality was guaranteed when the data were being used for this analysis (available at the hospital in Gabrovo).

1521,S027823911101305X,Orofacial Tuberculosis—A 16-Year Experience With 46 Cases,"Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is an uncommon form of chronic infection, which does not present with the typical signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis. Most extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis affect organs with suboptimal conditions for bacillary growth. Therefore, extrapulmonary tuberculosis generally has an insidious presentation, a slow evolution, and paucibacillary lesions and/or fluids. Access to the lesions through secretions and body fluids is not always possible; therefore, invasive techniques may be necessary to obtain material for diagnostic investigation. Orofacial tuberculosis is an uncommon form and presents at different sites such as the mandible (alveolar and basal bone); head; face and neck lymph nodes; salivary glands; maxilla and maxillary antrum; and soft tissues such as the gingiva, tongue, muscles of mastication, and buccal mucosa. The diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is often overlooked because it has no specific pathognomonic signs.",0
1526,S2352621115000649,The imaging manifestations of caseous pulmonary tuberculosis with type-II diabetes mellitus," 2 Material and methods  2.1 General information This study was conducted at Zhongnan Hospital which is a 2000-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and was approved by the institutional review boards of the hospital. The medical records of patients admitted between January 1997 and December 2012 were searched to identify all confirmed cases of DMTB. Among them, the main criteria for hospital admission of TB patients include sepsis, hemoptysis, respiratory failure, advanced malnutrition, and pleural effusion. All patients who had undergone X-Ray, CT examination, Fiberbronchoscopy or pathological examination and who met the criteria for diagnosis of TB were eligible for this study. The diagnosis of DM was defined as clinical manifestation and laboratory examination, the diagnosis of TB was defined as radiographical evidence of active pulmonary infection, confirmed by Fiberbronchoscopy or pathological demonstration of the organisms from lung biopsy specimen.   2.2 Inspection methods X-ray was operated on front and lateral chest radiographs; CT scan was operated on 14 patients, including the routine scan and the contrast scan. Routine scanning of the entire lung was performed with 16 × 1.5-mm or 32 × 1.2-mm collimation, Contrast CT examination was performed in patients with the non-ionic-iodine contrast agent Iopamiro, by means of automatic injection (2.5–3.0 mL/s) after 40–45 s of injection. Window settings were modified on all images to optimally assess lung parenchyma (window level, ?500 to ?700 Hounsfield units [HU]; window width, 1000–1500 HU) and mediastinum (window level, 30–50 HU; window width, 350–500 HU).   2.3 Statistic analysis Measurement datas were manifested using mean ± standard, correlations between different CT abnormalities were analyzed using the Spearman test. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 16.0. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 with two-sided analysis.  ",0
1531,S1058274608003376,Shoulder arthroplasty complicated by mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: A case report," Case report A 78-year-old woman underwent cemented, humeral head replacement for humeral head osteonecrosis at another institution 15 months prior to presentation. The patient developed progressive pain and swelling of the shoulder 5 months after the procedure. Initial cultures from an aspiration were negative. However, based on the clinical picture, she was diagnosed with an infected arthroplasty. The initial treatment consisted of serial debridements with concomitant administration of intravenous antibiotics. The prosthesis was initially retained, but the infection was not controlled and the wound eventually broke down. Ten months after insertion of the prosthesis, it was removed and the wound covered with a latissimus dorsi flap. Even after prosthetic removal, the debridement was incomplete with retention of the cement mantle in the humeral canal. Continuing poor control of the infection with recurring sinus tracks led to further surgical procedures with progressive removal of additional humeral shaft. Multiple organisms were cultured throughout this process, including staphylococcus aureus, serratia, and pseudomonas. Ten months after commencement of treatment for an infection, the patient presented for our evaluation with obvious ongoing infection. She had multiple draining sinuses and severe pain in the shoulder. Due to the loss of the proximal humerus, the shoulder was flail with no active shoulder function and marked instability. There was no detectable neurologic injury despite her many procedures. Initial radiographs revealed loss of approximately one half of the humerus with a methylmethacrylate cap ( Figure 1). The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both normal at 20 mm/hr and 1.37, respectively. Indium-111 bone scanning was consistent with ongoing soft tissue and bone infection. Of particular note, the patient's family history revealed that her father and sister had both been treated for tuberculosis in the 1940s. The patient's past medical history included a positive tuberculin skin test. She had not received treatment, since her chest x-ray was clear. Her past medical history was also positive for treated hypothyroidism, but was otherwise unremarkable. She was treated with repeat debridements with submission of deep tissue cultures and temporary implantation of a long antibiotic impregnated methylmethacrylate spacer. This had to be removed after several weeks due to instability. Corynebacterium was grown on cultures from the initial debridement and serratia from the second procedure. In response to these cultures, the initial antibiotic regimen consisted of vancomycin and was subsequently changed to levofloxacin. Neither was effective with persistent wound drainage. Cultures ultimately grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Treatment was then switched to rifampin, isoniazid, and pyridoxine. Four weeks after commencing this regimen, the wound drainage stopped and all sinuses healed. Eighteen months after our initial debridement, an oncologic proximal humeral replacement was used to reconstruct the proximal humerus ( Figure 2). Heavy nonabsorbable suture was utilized to secure the humeral head. This temporarily provided a stable shoulder but ultimately failed. At the 30-month follow-up, her shoulder was pain free and absent of any signs of infection. However, there was no active shoulder function and marked antero-superior instability with attempts at motion. The potential for reconstruction with a reverse shoulder replacement, as those devices had by then received FDA approval, was discussed with the patient. She declined because of the potential of prosthetic instability with the presence of substantial proximal soft tissue damage. ",0
1534,S1744904907000203,"A case with pulmonary tuberculosis, pleural effusion, miliary tuberculosis, cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, tubercular arthritis, psoas abscess and severe anemia"," Case report A 35-year-old female presented in April 2003 with swelling and pain left knee, backache and fever for the past 3 months. Initial examination showed swelling in left knee joint with tenderness. X-ray of the knee joint was not demonstrative except for slight osteolysis in lower part of patella. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of left knee showed destruction of patella with joint effusion (probable etiology tubercular) and grade 1 signal in posterior horn of medial meniscus (Fig. 1 ). Psoas abscess was noted on X-ray abdomen and on MRI (Fig. 2 ) and pus was aspirated for direct smear and culture which showed gram- positive and gram-negative bacilli. Pus culture for acid fast bacilli was positive. A detailed clinical history and previous treatment record revealed anti-tuberculosis treatment taken for sputum smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis in February 1989 for 9 months, daily treatment regimen. Patient had complete improvement in her symptoms, of fever with evening rise and cough with expectoration, following treatment. In 1996, she developed high-grade fever with evening rise, cough and left-sided chest pain. Sputum smear for acid fast bacilli was negative and chest X-ray showed left pleural effusion. Pleural fluid examination showed numerous lymphocytes with markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and adenine deaminase (ADA) levels suggesting tubercular pleural effusion. Patient was treated with anti-tuberculosis treatment for 8 months with complete improvement in her symptoms. X-ray at end of treatment showed complete resolution of effusion. In January 2002, patient had fever, breathlessness, dry cough and generalized weakness. Chest X-ray and CECT chest (Fig. 3 ) was consistent with military tuberculosis (MTB). Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for direct smear and BACTEC culture for acid fast bacilli was negative. Patient was put on anti-tuberculosis treatment in March 2002 under category II of the directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) regimen. In addition, ofloxacin 400mg was given for 3 months. During the treatment course, in July 2002, patient developed right cervical lymphadenitis with discharging sinus. Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy with postinfectious bronchiectasis. The anti-tuberculosis treatment was continued for further 8 months, with complete improvement in signs and symptoms. After 2 months of symptom free period patient was diagnosed as tubercular arthritis knee joint and tubercular psoas abscess with infection-associated severe anemia. HIV-1 and 2 status by ELISA was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 120mm in 1st hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) was normal. Her hemoglobin was 10.2gm% at time of presentation which gradually came down to 5.9gm% in 5 months. No other hematological abnormality was noted. Patient was put on anti tuberculosis treatment for 12 months with ofloxacin 800mg in the initial 3 months. At treatment completion repeat MRI of left knee joint and spine was normal. Hemoglobin was 10.3gm% and patient was asymptomatic at 1 year of follow-up. ",0
1538,S1567134810001863,A high prevalence of resistance in new tuberculosis cases of midwestern Brazil," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case definition This study was conducted between January 2006 and July 2007 at Anuar Auad Hospital, a tropical disease reference hospital in Goiás responsible for the diagnosis of most TB cases in this region. During this period, 205 clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB patients were sputum-positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). According to the Brazilian Tuberculosis Control Program, sputum from AFB-positive patients is not typically submitted for subsequent culture. AFB-positive patients that had not yet started drug treatment were invited to participate in our study, and 132 agreed by signing an informed consent form that was approved by a Brazilian Ethical Committee (UFG No. 006/2005). There were no exclusion criteria for participation in the study. Sputum samples were collected and cultivated in Lowenstein–Jensen (L–J) media. The following variables were ascertained from medical records or patient interviews: age, gender, address, presence/absence of a bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) scar, tobacco and alcohol use, previous TB infection, treatment status, and HIV status.   2.2  M. tuberculosis strains Samples were processed according to Brazilian TB Control Program Guidelines (Brasil, 2005). Briefly samples were treated with equal volume of a 0.6M solution of Na3PO4·12H2O for 24h at 36°C followed by neutralization with the addition of the same volume of a 1.7M NaH2PO4 solution. Samples were centrifuged, ressuspended in sterilized distilled water, plated in L–J media, and cultured aerobically at 37°C for up to 8 weeks. The etiological agent was identified based on its growth rate, colony morphology, and biochemical properties including growth inhibition by p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNB-500?g/ml), thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH-2?g/ml), and niacin production (Brasil, 2005).   2.3 Susceptibility tests INH and RMP (Sigma–Aldrich) susceptibility testing was performed on L–J medium using the standard proportion method described by Canetti et al. (1969). Briefly, resistance was defined as when at least 1% of the colonies that grew on drug-free medium were observed on medium containing 0.2?g/ml of INH or 40?g/ml of RMP.   2.4 DNA extraction Cultures from L–J medium were heat sterilized and DNA was extracted from colonies according to methodology of van Embden et al. (1993).   2.5 PCR and sequence analysis A 332-bp rpoB fragment was amplified with primers rpoB 1 (5?-GGGAGCGGATGACCACCC-3?) and rpoB 2 (5?-GCGGTACGACGGCGTTTCGATGAAC-3?) (Siddiqi et al., 2002), and a 209-bp katG fragment was amplified with primers katG 1 (5?-GAAACAGCGGCGCTGATCGT-3?) and katG 2 (5?-GTTGTCCCATTTCGTCGGGG-3?) (Ozturk et al., 2005a). PCR was performed in an MJ966 Biocycler Thermocycler (Biosystems) at 94°C for 1min, 62°C (rpoB) or 65°C (katG) for 1min, and 72°C for 1min for 35 cycles. The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels and were purified with Micro Columns (E.Z.N.A-Omega Biotek). Sequencing of the purified PCR products was performed with the BigDye Terminator V.3 Cycle Sequencing Kit and BigDye XTerminator Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and run on the ABI Prism 3130 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The Sequencing Analysis software package (version 3.3) was used to analyze the data quality. The sequences were compared to H37Rv strain sequences (GenBank accession numbers BX842574 and X68081) using ClustalX (version 2.0) and BioEdit (version 7.0).   2.6 Mutation in the promoter of the inhA gene analysis by PCR Samples that did not reveal mutation in the sequenced region of the katG gene were analyzed for mutation at the ribosome binding site in the promoter of the mabA–inhA operon by PCR. The pair of primers mabAF (5?CGAAGTGTGCTGAGTCACACCG3?) and inhARmut (5?AGTCACCCCGACAACCTATTA3?), described by Herrera-León et al. (2005), was used to amplify a 146-bp fragment of the mutated region, while the pair of primers mabAF and inhARwt (5?AGTCACCCCGACAACCTATCG) was used in a separate PCR to amplify a 146-bp fragment of the wild type region. PCR was performed in an MJ966 Biocycler Thermocycler (Biosystems) at 94°C for 1min, 68°C for 1min, and 72°C for 1min for 35 cycles. The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining.   2.7 Genotyping by IS6110-RFLP IS6110-RFLP analysis was performed as described by van Soolingen et al. (1994). Briefly, extracted mycobacterial DNA was digested with PvuII, electrophoresed, and hybridized with a 245-bp PCR-amplified probe directed against the right arm of IS6110. Following hybridization, the insertion sequences were visualized with the AlkPhos Direct Labeling and Detection Systems Kit (Amersham-Biosciences). DNA from the reference strain MT14323 (kindly provided by Dr. Philip N. Suffys, FIOCRUZ, RJ, Brazil) was included in each gel for normalization. The IS6110-RFLP patterns were analyzed with Bionumerics (Windows version 4.0, Applied Maths) and a similarity matrix and dendrogram were constructed using the DICE similarity coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm with a position tolerance of 1.5%.   2.8 Statistical analysis Data was analyzed with EpiInfo software version 6.03 (CDC, Atlanta, GA, US; public domain). Fishe?s exact test and ? 2 were used.  ",0
1558,S2214623714000301,"Vitamin D status, receptor gene polymorphisms, and supplementation on tuberculosis: A systematic review of case-control studies and randomized controlled trials"," Conclusions The implication of vitamin D on TB infection has a long history. Our analysis reported here demonstrates the impacts of serum 25(OH)D levels, VDR polymorphisms, and vitamin D supplementation on the risk of acquiring TB and on the outcomes of TB infections. An increased risk of TB was observed among the individuals with lower serum vitamin D levels. Additionally, certain VDR polymorphisms, including the heterozygous and autosomal recessive forms of the four SNPs (ApaI, BsmI, FokI, and TaqI) that we analyzed, have shown an association with the increased risk of acquiring TB. Finally, vitamin D supplementation appears to have a positive effect on TB outcomes, particularly with regard to the length of infection. Due to the fact that studies analyzed did not report their results in a uniform manner and no raw data are available for these studies, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis of the data. While the findings in this review show a potential impact of vitamin D on TB infection, more well-designed clinical trials are needed in order to fully characterize the effect, particularly with regard to the VDR polymorphisms and vitamin D supplementation [53]. Vitamin D has been identified as an important agent in preventing many different infections and oncologic processes in the human body. Further characterization of its effects and impacts on these illnesses will allow us to develop improved treatment methods for TB in the future, as well as other chronic diseases. ",0
1567,S1871141318300192,Exploring the association between polymorphisms at 3’UTR SLC11A1 gene microsatellites and resistance to tuberculosis: A case-control study in Bos taurus dairy cattle," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study population A total of 576 Bos taurus dairy cattle belonged to Holstein (n = 427) and Jersey (n = 149) breed were chosen for this study among a total of about 6000 animals present in two herds. Samples were collected from 375 of 4000 Holstein cows from herd A, located in Arias county, Córdoba province, Argentina (33°38?00?S 62°25?00?W), that had a 10% estimated prevalence of bTB; and 52 of 500 Holstein and 149 of 1500 Jersey animals from herd B (n = 201), located in Lincoln county, Buenos Aires province, Argentina (34°51?00?S 61°31?00?W), with 5% and 15% estimated prevalence of bTB in Holstein and Jersey breeds, respectively ( Table 1). Initially, herds were tested for bTB and animals under study were randomly drawn from a list of infected (cases) and non-infected (controls). All animals in each herd shared the same environment and nutritional conditions, therefore it was estimated that they were homogeneous in terms of environmental exposure to Mycobacterium bovis. All animals included in the present study were cows over 25 months of age and breeding was by artificial insemination from at least 30 different bulls’ semen. Animals were milked twice a day and kept under semi-intensive production system based on pasture supplemented with concentrate diet.   2.2 Diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis Tuberculin skin test was carried out to identify Mycobacterium bovis infected and non-infected cattle according to the Argentinean National Veterinary Services (SENASA, 2012). Briefly, 0.1?ml of PPD of M. bovis was injected into the caudal fold of animals and the size of reaction was evaluated 72?h later. TB negative or positive results were considered if skin thickness was ? 3?mm or ? 3?mm, respectively. Fifteen PPD-positive animals (11 from herd A and 4 from herd B) were euthanized and full necropsies were carried out. No more animals were evaluated due to operational capacity. For bacteriology, tissues samples were aseptically collected and grouped into four sets: head (retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph node -LN-), respiratory (tracheobronchial and mediastinal LN, and lung sample), digestive (mesenteric and hepatic LN, and liver sample), and mammary (udder and supra mammary LN). All samples were maintained at 4?°C and stored later at ? 20?°C until used. Samples were homogenized mechanically for 3?min (Basic Masticator, IUL Instruments type 470, Spain), decontaminated by Petroff method (Jorge et al., 2005) and cultured in triplicates on the egg-based Stonebrink solid media at 37?°C for at least 8 weeks. Cultures were observed weekly twice, and positive cultures were stained with Ziehl-Neelsen for identification of acid-fast bacteria (Jorge et al., 2005). Histopathology samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. After being cut in 5??m-thick sections, specimens were deparaffinized, hydrated and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen. Molecular identification of M. tuberculosis complex from isolates of the tissues samples was performed based on IS6110 technique (Zumárraga et al., 2005). Then, these isolates were typed by spoligotyping to identify M. bovis, according to Kamerbeek et al. (1997). The spoligotypes were collected and compared with M. bovis spoligotypes according to Shimizu et al. (2014).   2.3 DNA isolation and genotyping Hair follicles were used for DNA extraction using the phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol protocol previously described by Hasenauer et al. (2013). Capillary electrophoresis was carried out to genotype the Ms 1 and 2 at the 3´ UTR SLC11A1 gene. Both Ms at the 3? UTR of the bovine SLC11A1 gene (GenBank U12862) were amplified by multiplex PCR. Primer pair 1 was used to amplify the region containing Ms 1 -nucleotide positions 1691–1848- (Fw1 5´-GATCAGGAGAAGGGGAGGA-3´ and Rv1 5´-CAGCTTCCAGAACTCCCTGT-3´) (Hasenauer et al., 2013). Primer pair 2 was used to amplify the region containing Ms 2 -nucleotide positions 1814–1988- (Fw2 5´-AAGGCAGCAAGACAGACAGG-3´ and Rv2 5´-ATGGAACTCACGTTGGCTG-3´) (Barthel et al., 2000). Primers Fw1 and Rv2 were 5´ labeled with the fluorescent dye NED and 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM), respectively. Multiplex PCR was performed using 20?ng of genomic DNA in a 15??l reaction containing reaction buffer 1×, 1.5?mM MgCl2, 200??M dNTPs, 0.2666??M of the primer Fw1 and Rv1 and 0.0533??M of the primer Fw2 and Rv2, and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Inbio-HighWay). The PCR parameters were the following: an initial denaturation step at 94?°C for 5?min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (94?°C for 45?s), annealing (59?°C for 30?s), and extension (72?°C for 45?s), with a final extension step at 72?°C for 60?min. The PCR product (1??l) was added to 10.0??l of deionized formamide and 0.1??l of GeneScan 500 LIZ Size Standard (Applied Biosystems). Then, the samples were denatured at 94?°C for 3?min, cooled at 4?°C, and loaded on the ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem) equipped with a 36-cm-long capillary. The separation medium used was the POP-7 polymer (Applied Biosystems). The size of alleles was determined using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems).   2.4 Statistical analysis Allelic and genotypic frequencies and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium were calculated using GenePop (Raymond and Rousset, 1995). Associations between the absence or presence of response to caudal fold tuberculin skin test (controls and cases, respectively) and polymorphisms at the 3´ UTR SLC11A1 gene microsatellites were verified by Fisher´s exact test using GraphPad software (on-line version: http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/). Odd´s ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using VassarStats (http://vassarstats.net/odds2x2.html). Comparisons of allelic and genotypic frequencies for Ms1 and Ms2 at the 3'UTR region of the SLC11A1 gene between the bovine breeds analyzed were carried out by exact G test, using the population differentiation option, with GenePop software. In all tests, significance was set at p ? .05.  ",0
1576,S2213007113000415,Two cases of culture proven Mycobacterium tuberculosis presenting with a broad-complex tachycardia and non-caseating granulomas," Case two A 25 year-old Asian gentleman presented with intermittent chest pain at rest and palpitations. He was morbidly obese with well-controlled asthma, smoking two cigarettes daily. His presenting electrocardiograph showed T-wave inversion in V2–V4 with a positive Troponin-I of 0.099 ug/L. Coronary angiography showed unobstructed coronaries. Post procedure he had short episodes of a narrow complex tachycardia, which settled with bisoprolol. An echocardiogram showed good overall systolic function. He was discharged with outpatient follow-up. He re-presented three weeks later with progressive dyspnoea. An echocardiogram demonstrated a severe cardiomyopathy with significantly impaired left ventricular function (ejection fraction 33%) and an associated stage 1 diastolic dysfunction. Electrocardiography detected a sustained monomorphic broad complex tachycardia. Electrophysiological study was unremarkable. An endomyocardial biopsy was performed, revealing areas of myocyte loss and destruction associated with an inflammatory cell infiltrate including giant cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes and occasional eosinophils. Granulomas were not identified. Pathology interpreted these changes as a giant cell myocarditis, for which he received a 3-day course of anti-thymocyte globulin and was commenced on oral prednisolone at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg. An ICD was also inserted. Owing to his body habitus CMR was not possible. Thoracic and abdominal CT-scan demonstrated significant lymphadenopathy. He proceeded to positron emission topography (PET), showing PET-avid lymphadenopathy in the right paratracheal and subcarinal regions. A TB-Elispot interferon gamma-release assay was reactive. A mantoux test was similarly positive (16 mm). His LDH however, was elevated at 325 IU/L. The differential diagnosis included both lymphoma and tuberculosis. He underwent an EBUS biopsy of his right peribronchial lymph node, showing non-necrotising granulomas and a negative TB-PCR. However after 18 days, the culture grew M. tuberculosis, finally confirming the diagnosis. He therefore commenced anti-tuberculosis therapy for six months, while continuing prednisolone. Following four months of steroid and TB treatment his ventricular function showed significant improvement. A repeat cardiac biopsy showed resolving inflammation with re-organisation of the myocardium, suggesting a response to the combination of TB treatment and immunosuppression. It remains unclear as to whether there was a degree of TB myocarditis underlying his initial presentation. He remains under cardiology and respiratory follow-up. ",0
1609,S0090825805001149,Peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian cancer can be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction: A case report," Case A 37-year-old married woman, gravida 1, para 1, complained of aggressive abdominal distension over the preceding 2 months. Her past medical, gynecologic, and surgical histories were unremarkable except for a history of cesarean section 5 years previously. When tracing more details of her history, we found that one of her work colleagues had been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 6 months previously after the laparotomy. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension, uterine nodularity, and a mildly enlarged right adnexum. Profiling of serum tumor markers revealed a high level of only one marker, carcinoma antigen (CA)-125 (402.2 unit/mL), with normal levels of alpha fetoprotein (APF), carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA), CA-19-9, and CA-15-3. Neither PCR analysis of blood nor a standard chest film revealed evidence of TB. Pelvic sonography disclosed normal contour and size of pelvic organs, but computed tomography (CT) showed multiple, tiny soft-tissue nodules over the omentum of the middle abdomen accompanied by moderate ascites. Clinical interpretation of the various results was inconclusive and did not facilitate a definite diagnosis for tuberculosis, normal-sized ovarian cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with a midline incision, and biopsies were obtained from the omentum and bilateral fallopian tubes and pelvic lymph nodes for presumed ovarian malignancy. At laparotomy, a total volume of 1000 mL ascites fluid was aspirated, and an omental cake was found to be adherent to the anterior abdominal wall. Frozen sections sampled from multiple miliary deposits all over the peritoneal omentum, abdominal wall, and organs (primarily the intestines, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries) revealed peritoneal TB (Fig. 1 ). Microscopically, the sections of the lymph nodes revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 2a). Mycobacteria were identified by acid-fast stain (Fig. 2b). The ascites sample result was obtained 24 h later and was positive for a PCR based assay specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex [3]. This PCR primers can simultaneously amplify a 123-bp fragment from IS6110, an insertion element with multiple copies in the genome of members of the M. tuberculosis complex, and a 600-bp internal control fragment (Fig 3 ). Subsequent culture of peritoneal implants and ascites fluid grew M. tuberculosis. The patient was discharged from the hospital on anti-tuberculosis therapy of ethambutol, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid. She has shown significant clinical improvement and remains well to date. ",0
1629,S0954611107004404,Parenchymal pseudotumoral tuberculosis: Case series and systematic review of literature," Methods  Case series The computer records of patients admitted from April 2002 to December 2006 to the pulmonary medicine ward of this institute with a diagnosis of tuberculosis were reviewed. Patients with the discharge diagnosis of pseudotumoral tuberculosis, tuberculosis and mass were selected. The original case records of the patients were then retrieved from the central registration department. Demographic information such as age and gender, clinical status at admission were recorded. Details of the clinical manifestations and investigations like computed tomography (CT), bronchoscopy, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), trucut biopsies were also recorded. Patients were included if they met the following criteria: (1) one or more mass of at least 3cm and one of the following four findings on investigation—(a) histopathology showing acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and epithelioid granulomas or (b) granulomatous inflammation (AFB negative) and complete response to anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) alone or (c) biopsy specimen positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on culture or (d) sputum positive for AFB or sputum cultures growing M. tuberculosis.   Literature review Two of the authors (RS and RA) independently conducted a MEDLINE search using the terms tuberculosis and mass, pseudotumoral tuberculosis, tuberculosis and carcinoma lung in the English literature between 1964 and December 2006 and supplemented this by hand search of literature and personal records. Parenchymal pseudotumoral tuberculosis was defined by the presence of one or more masses of at least 3cm. The individual cases were reviewed and available data regarding clinical presentation, radiographic findings, management and outcomes were extracted. Lymph nodal pseudotumoral tuberculosis was not included for data analysis. Data of the current series was then compared with earlier published literature.   Statistics The statistical package Stats Direct (Stats Direct version 2.6.2 for MS-Windows, England, Stats Direct Ltd., 2005. http://www.statsdirect.com) was used to perform the statistical analysis. Epidemiological and outcome parameters of the patients are presented in a descriptive fashion (mean±SD or median with range).  ",0
1673,S1744904907000495,Pulmonary tuberculosis in a case of Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome," Clinical presentation A 26-year-old male patient, with multiple malformations, short stature and mental retardation presented to the outpatient department with complaints of fever, cough and dyspnea for the last 2 months. The prenatal and natal history of the child was uneventful. The mother revealed that the patient had delayed developmental milestones, feeding and speech difficulty since childhood. The patient had history of gastro-esophageal-reflux disease (GERD) with severe constipation. History of keloid formation with only minimal trauma to the skin was present. The patient did not go to school and appeared mentally challenged. He had been operated for club feet at the age of 2 years. The patient was the second, of 3 children of parents, with no history of consanguinity. There was no history of similar complaints in the siblings. The patient appeared to have a short stature for his age. His craniofacial features included a prominent forehead, downward slanting of the palpebral fissure, epicanthal folds, beaked nose, grimacing smile and micrognathia (Figure 1 ). Head circumference was 48cm which was under the 50th percentile for his age and sex. Examination of the ears and ophthalmologic system did not reveal any abnormality. Dental examination revealed crowding of teeth, malocclusion and talon cusps on the upper incisors of the secondary dentition. The patient had a stiff gait with scoliosis (Cobb's angle of 68°). Hypotonia and pectus excavatum was present. Examination of the limbs revealed large first toes with broad terminal phalanges, abnormal shape and angulation of the first metatarsal and fifth finger clinodactyly (Figures 2 and 3  ). Loss of terminal phalanges of the hands secondary to minor trauma was present. Examination of the genitourinary system was remarkable for presence of bilateral undescended testes. The patient had speech difficulty, short attention span with an intelligent quotient (IQ) of 54. Examination of the abdominal and cardiovascular system was unremarkable. Capillary hemangiomas at multiple sites, keloid formation at the sites of trauma and hyperpigmented skin at peripheries of upper limbs and lower limbs was present. Height of the patient was 147cm. Routine laboratory investigations of the patient were all within normal limits. The patient tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The CD4 and CD8 levels were normal. Radiographs of the patient confirmed the above findings. Bone age in this patient was normal. Karyotyping revealed no chromosomal abnormality. Examination of the respiratory system was unremarkable with a normal chest radiograph. Sputum for fungus and acid fast bacilli was negative. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed areas of patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe with fibro infiltrative opacities in both lungs (Figure 4 ). Bronchoscopy was unremarkable. Bronchial aspirate for acid fast bacilli detection by culture on L-J medium was positive. BACTEC was positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug susceptibility testing showed the bacilli to be sensitive to all the first line anti-tubeculosis drugs. MTb PCR was positive for the insertion sequence IS6110. The patient was started on anti-tuberculosis treatment. Patient responded to the treatment and bronchial aspirate for acid fast bacilli was negative at the end of treatment.Currently, the patient is being followed up for orthodontic management of feeding difficulty and is on medication for GERD and constipation. The patient is also undergoing speech and cognitive therapy. ",0
1690,S1571467507000673,Miliary tuberculosis induced by intravesical Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy for bladder carcinoma: A case report," 2 Case report An 82-year-old man was admitted to hospital in June 2006 for evaluation of weight loss and lethargy of 2 months duration and recent onset of low-grade fever. Twenty-four months prior to this admission he was diagnosed with pT1 transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder along with concurrent carcinoma in situ. Following transurethral resection of the bladder tumour, he was treated with intravesical instillation of BCG. This was delayed because of urethral stricture, which required dilatation. One week following urethral dilatation he started a course of weekly instillation of intravesical BCG (ImmuCyst 81mg lyophilized powder with diluent for reconstituition, Aventis Pasteur Limited) for 6 weeks, commencing in November 2004. The reconstituted product contained 10.5±8.7×108 colony forming units per instillation dose. This was followed, after a 3-month break, by monthly instillations of BCG for 6 months. After the sixth dose the patient was admitted for a brief period with macrohaematuria, which settled spontaneously, and two further monthly installations of BCG were then administered after a 3-month gap. The last dose was given in April 2006 and a subsequent cystoscopy and biopsy showed a good response. On admission in June 2006, the patient had a mild normocytic anaemia and slightly elevated inflammatory markers. There was moderate renal impairment but liver function tests were normal. Urine examination showed scanty red blood cells and few white blood cells with no bacterial growth. Chest radiograph was normal. At this stage, the patient was referred for CT of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out recurrent TCC, metastatic disease or other malignancy. It was also decided to include the chest at the time of scanning and volume acquisitions were performed. This was done on a 64 slice Toshiba Aquilion CT scanner using the following parameters: 0.5mm collimation; 120kV; modulated mA; 0.5s rotation time. Thoracic images showed miliary nodules distributed diffusely throughout both lungs in a random pattern. Using Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), the nodules were better appreciated. There were a few areas of peripheral consolidation anteriorly and posteriorly in both lungs. The appearances were felt to be due to infection and tuberculosis was raised as a possibility at this stage, particularly with the history of treatment with intravesical BCG. Sputum did not stain positive for acid fast bacilli (AFB). Bronchoscopy and lavage was performed with the bronchial aspirate containing moderate number of leukocytes only. Light growth of upper respiratory flora was also noted. Initial microscopic studies for mycobacteria did not reveal AFB. Although the initial staining for AFB was negative, sputum culture revealed Mycobacteria. This was done using the BACTEC MGIT 960 instrument with BBL MGIT 7ml tubes (Mycobacteria growth indicator tube). The strain of Mycobacteria isolated was identified as Mycobacterium bovis, sensitive to ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, but resistant to pyrazinamide, by the Health Protection Agency/National Mycobacterium Reference Unit, London, United Kingdom (Figs. 1–3 ). During his inpatient stay, the patient developed lower limb deep vein thrombi which initially required anticoagulation followed by inferior vena caval filter insertion. The patient had deteriorated clinically by the time treatment for TB was started and died within a few days of starting antituberculous therapy. The coroner's post-mortem recorded tuberculous bronchopneumonia and bladder carcinoma as cause of death with acute on chronic renal failure, acute pyelitis and femoral vein thrombosis as contributing factors.

1711,S1755001708000614,A case of disseminated tuberculosis with increased tumour markers and testicular involvement," Discussion Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death due to a single infectious agent worldwide. 1  Although the term “miliary TB” has been traditionally used for a pathological and radiological description, currently all forms of progressive widely disseminated haematogenous TB are being called as miliary TB, even the classical pathological or radiological findings are absent. 2  Many adult patients with progressive tuberculosis have accompanying medical conditions that cause their specific immune responses to wane. Our patient was not immuncompromised and he had no high risk condition associated with progressive tuberculosis. Generally, when M. tuberculosis is identified in any specimen, other systems of patients with suspected tuberculosis are not tested. As a result of this inclination, involvement of multiple organs with TB is probably much more common than it is recognized; therefore, most of them are overlooked. 2  Abdominal involvement is a rare form of TB. CA-125 may be used as a marker for diagnosis, and in the follow-up of the patients with abdominal tuberculosis. 3–6  CA-19-9 is expressed in mucous cells of the bronchial gland and surface of the bronchiolar surface epithelium cells in benign pulmonary diseases. 7  It has been reported in several case reports that the level of CA-19-9 increased in various body fluids in patients with tuberculosis and decreased after anti-tuberculosis therapy. The authors suggested that CA-19-9 level may reflect the activity of pulmonary tuberculosis. 7–9  CA-125 and CA-19-9 levels were found to be increased in our case. Plasma levels of these markers were started to decline after 2 months, and found within the normal levels at the end of anti-tuberculous therapy (Table 1). AFP level was only marginally elevated to 9.6ng/mL and then decreased to 7.6ng/mL over a six-month period. Therefore, it may not reflect the disease activity or response to therapy in tuberculosis. It has been known that tumour markers significantly decrease following orchidectomy in testicular tumour cases. In our case the elevation of tumour markers was considered as a reflection of disseminated tuberculosis, so tumour markers did not decreased immediately after orchidectomy. Existence of a testicular mass was a coincidence that helped us to make the accurate diagnosis by an orchidectomy. It is not clear whether the actual cause of elevated levels of tumour markers is either abdominal or testicular involvement. To our knowledge this is the first in the literature where both tumour markers have been investigated simultaneously and found to be elevated in a patient with disseminated TB. We suggest that measurement of these markers may achieve a useful non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. It may also be a useful to screen the response to anti-tuberculous therapy. However, it is sure that further studies in prospective design are needed to claim this hypothesis. ",0
1716,S1571467510000180,Myocardial tuberculosis presenting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary venous occlusion," 2 Case report A 26-year-old lady presented with gradual onset of breathlessness on exertion, fatigue, non-productive cough and loss of 15kg weight over a period of 6 months. On hospital admission, the patient's temperature was 37.3°C, pulse was regular, heart rate was 98 beats/min, BP was 126/88mmHg and transcutaneous oxygen saturation was 94%. The respiratory rate was normal, but breath sounds were diminished in the lower parts of the both lungs, and a few crackles were heard bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination revealed muffled first and second heart sounds, third heart sound and systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation. The Jugular venous pulse was raised (10cm). There was mild pedal edema. No clubbing or cyanosis was present. The abdomen was soft with tenderness over the liver and the spleen. Laboratory findings revealed normocytic, normochromic anemia (hemoglobin, 12gdl?1), a leukocytosis of 15,600?l, and a slightly elevated platelet count (3,35,000?l). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35mm in the1sthr. C reactive protein was slightly elevated (41mgl?1). Chest X-ray done at admission revealed cardiomegaly and right pleural effusion (Fig. 1 ). Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia and non-specific ST–T changes in the lateral leads. Trans thoracic echocardiography was performed which showed a mass in the left atrium involving the interatrial septum (Fig. 2 ). The mass was seen to obstruct the left lower pulmonary vein with a gradient of 16mmHg. The right upper and lower pulmonary veins were not visualized properly. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was estimated at 40+RAP. To further evaluate the extent of the intracardiac mass lesion, contrast enhanced CT of the chest was done. CT showed mass like thickening of the left atrial wall with extension into the right atrial wall and thickening of the interatrial septum (Fig. 5). There was some obstruction of the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins by the infiltrative hypodense lesion. There was mild compression of the right pulmonary artery (Fig. 3 ). The mass was seen to reach up to the ostium of the left lower pulmonary vein with some narrowing (Fig. 4 ). The left upper lobe pulmonary vein appeared normal. The mass showed no calcification. The lungs were normal and there was no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The main pulmonary artery diameter was 4.2cm. Right main pulmonary artery and its braches appeared attenuated in caliber as compared to the left side. Small right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly were noted. With this background and investigations, the diagnosis of an infiltrating mass of the left atrium was made. At this stage, we were considering tuberculosis, angiosarcoma, lymphoma and rhabdomyosarcoma as differentials. Angiosarcoma is the most common primary cardiac malignancy and tends to occur in the right atrium and involve the pericardium. Primary cardiac lymphoma also commonly arises in the right side of the heart, with a predilection for the right atrium. However, they are often associated with large pericardial effusions. Rhabdomyosarcomas are the most common cardiac malignancy in infants and children. They may arise anywhere in the myocardium and are more likely than other sarcomas to involve or arise from cardiac valves. Rhabdomyosarcomas usually appears as smooth or irregular low-attenuation mass in a cardiac chamber on CT. Following the CT (Figs. 5 and 6  ), an endomyocardial biopsy was done which revealed a granulomatous lesion with epithelioid cells, Langhan‘s type of giant cells, lymphocytes and foci of caseous necrosis. Thus the diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed and the patient was started on anti tuberculous medications. The patient was followed up with echocardiography and complete resolution of the left atrial mass, obstruction to the pulmonary veins and interatrial septal thickening was observed after a period of 9 months.

1718,S0899707114002289,Tuberculosis of the manubriosternal joint and concurrent asymptomatic active pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient presenting with a chest wall mass," 2 Case report A 62-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 2-month history of chest swelling and presternal discomfort. Her past medical history was noncontributory, and she denied trauma or contact with tuberculosis. Physical examination only demonstrated a 4×6-cm presternal swelling. Pulmonary auscultation was normal, and neck and axillary palpation revealed no abnormal lymph nodes. Laboratory examinations were unremarkable. A lateral sternal radiography only showed presternal soft-tissue swelling but no cortical sclerosis or bone defects. The manubriosternal joint was not widened. A thoracic CT demonstrated a more prominent soft-tissue presternal mass centered on the manubriosternal joint. A smaller posterior collection, also centered on the manubriosternal joint, was also seen. The anterior and posterior bone cortex of the sternum was not thickened or permeated. The only osseous change on CT (just seen with bone window settings) was a subtle sclerosis of the juxtaarticular bone on both sides of the manubriosternal joint (Fig. 1 ). In light of the CT findings, an MR imaging of the anterior chest wall was performed. On the MR images, the manubriosternal joint space was not widened, but the space was hypointense on T1-weighted images and mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The anterior and posterior soft-tissue masses showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted images. The bone marrow signal intensity of the juxtaarticular bone (the distal manubrium and proximal body of the sternum) was markedly decreased on T1-weighted MR images. Both the juxtaarticular bone marrow and the soft-tissue masses exhibited high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR images revealed intense enhancement of the juxtaarticular bone marrow and of the peristernal soft-tissue masses. The presternal soft-tissue mass was largely necrotic, and its central necrotic part did not enhance (Fig. 2 ). Bone scintigraphy (Fig. 3 ) showed a nonspecific intense tracer uptake in the sternum. Interestingly, review of the thoracic CT images (lung windowing) also demonstrated multiple centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud opacities in both lungs, suggesting an infectious bronchiolitis (Fig. 4 ). A CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the presternal abscess demonstrated the presence of caseated granulomas and acid-fast bacilli, and a culture of the aspirated material yielded growth of M. tuberculosis by the fifth week. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed an active pulmonary tuberculosis. Surgical drainage of the presternal abscess was performed. The patient was also started on antituberculous treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. After 8weeks of treatment, the sternal swelling had reduced considerably in size, the presternal discomfort had disappeared, and a follow-up chest CT performed 12weeks later showed almost complete resolution of the peristernal soft-tissue masses and of the lung parenchyma opacities (not shown).

She had pain in the abdomen of over earlier 6 months, which was more in the epigastric region. The pain was dull aching, continuous and had no aggravating or relieving factors. Investigations revealed Hb 11.8 gms%. TLC, DLC, Urine (RE), Blood sugar and Creatinine were within normal limits. Serum Na was 134 mEq/L and serum K was 3.5 mEq/L. Plain X-ray chest was normal. Plain X-ray of abdomen showed multiple fluid levels in the upper abdomen and USG of the abdomen showed mild ascites and distention of small bowel loops with air fluid inside. Both the investigations were suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Clinical diagnosis was acute on chronic intestinal obstruction. Operative findings revealed approximately 100 c.c fluid in the peritoneal cavity. A hard mass was palpated which was obliterating the lumen of caecum. Multiple mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged and firm. An ileo-caecal resection with ileo-ascending colon anastomosis was done. Post operative period was uneventful. ",0
1748,S0041134511003563,Pulmonary Tuberculosis in an HIV- and Hepatitis C Virus–Coinfected Kidney-Pancreas Transplant Recipient: A Case Report," Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible of serious infections both in solid organ transplant recipients and in HIV-infected patients. As reported in several observational studies worldwide, the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) among renal transplant recipients is variable, and the incidence is estimated to be from 20 to 74 times higher than that for the general population. 5  The frequency of the disease appears to be different according to the transplanted organ, with higher frequency in lung recipients. 6,7  About two-thirds of reported cases of active TB disease in transplant recipients occur in the first posttransplant year, 8  with the median time to development of disease being 9 months after transplantation. In most cases, infection is thought to arise by reactivation of old foci of infection, because primary infection has only been documented in a small number of cases. Acquisition of TB from the donated organ has been documented in renal, lung, and liver transplantation, but appears to account for less than 5% of all active TB cases in transplant recipients. 8–12  The rate of primary infection is likely to be greater in developing countries, but this has not been carefully evaluated. Globally, about 30% of HIV-infected persons are estimated to have concomitant (usually latent) infection with M tuberculosis; this percentage varies from 14% in Europe to 46% in Southeast Asia. 13–15  In 2008, there were an estimated 1.4 million new cases of TB among persons with HIV infection, and TB accounted for 26% of AIDS-related deaths. The relative risk of TB among HIV-infected persons, compared with that among HIV-uninfected persons, ranges from 20- and 37-fold, depending on the state of the HIV epidemic.",0
1749,S0928098717302725,Development of a paediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to assess the impact of drug-drug interactions in tuberculosis co-infected malaria subjects: A case study with artemether-lumefantrine and the CYP3A4-inducer rifampicin," 2 Methods All population based PBPK modelling was conducted using the virtual clinical trials simulator Simcyp® (Simcyp® Ltd., a Certara company, Sheffield, UK, Version 16) using either the pre-validated in-built ‘Healthy Volunteer’ or ‘Paediatric’ population groups. The latter population group accounts for age-related changes in systems-parameters such as organ volumes, organ perfusion and ontogeny of drug metabolising enzymes (Johnson, 2005) (Johnson, 2008) (Small et al., 2017) and allows for the prediction of drug behaviour in paediatric population groups. In the case of both models, population variability is accounted for by the inclusion of a variability metric (% coefficient variability) having been established from public health data bases such as the US National health and Nutrition Examination Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/).  2.1 Study design A four stage strategy was employed for model development and validation (Fig. 1 ). Step 1: this step focussed on the development of Simcyp® compound files and validation of simulations with published clinical studies. For artemether and lumefantrine, these included a study conducted in 120 adult subjects who were orally dosed the branded combination Coartem® (Huang & Rowland, 2012), and studies conducted in 16 subjects who were orally dosed the branded combiantion Riamet® (Lefevre et al., 2002b). For lumefantrine an additional study included a 6-dose study conducted in 17 subjects (Ashley et al., 2007). Step 2: this step focussed on the validation of the adult DDI predictions. CYP3A4 inhibition and induction mechanisms were simulated using ketoconazole and rifampicin respectively. Clinical studies demonstrating such a DDI were obtained from Lefèvre et al. who studied AL with ketoconazole (Lefevre et al., 2002b) (single dose of 80/480mg of AL and 5day treatment with ketoconazole) and Lamorde et al. (Lamorde et al., 2013b), who studied AL DDI with rifampicin where rifampicin was dosed at 10mg/kg for the duration of the study with AL dosed as six 80/480mg doses (12hourly) on days 8, 9 and 10. Step 3: this step focussed on the validation of artemether and lumefantrine model predictions in paediatrics. In these studies, weight bandings were simulated based on dosing strategies for AL if the clinical study did not use a weight normalised dosing method. Dosing boundaries were set at 1 tablet for 5–14.9kg, 2 tablets for 15–24.9kg and 3 tablets for 25–34.9kg and trials were run to ensure, where possible, an equal proportion of subjects were included into each distribution banding based on the total number of subjects recruited within each reported trial. Simulated profiles were body weight stratified and analysed accordingly. Clinical studies used are detailed the results Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Step 4: this step focussed on simulations to predict the impact of rifampicin-mediated DDIs on artemether and lumefantrine pharmacokinetics in children of 2–5years of age over a weight boundary of 5–14.9kg or 15–24.9kg. In these simulations, trials of 100 subjects were simulated and analysed with appropriate weight-based dosing (see above) and under treatment of rifampicin with AL. For all validation steps, unless otherwise stated, all observed data sets were obtained from ‘supervised’ administration groups in reported clinical studies and simulated under ‘fed’ conditions. Furthermore, unless otherwise stated all simulations included subjects of ?5years.   2.2 Artemether-lumefantrine model development The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters required to describe the pharmacokinetic properties of artemether, lumefantrine and isoniazid are detailed in Table 1 . For artemether, literature-reported isozyme specific hepatic intrinsic clearances were utilised for the description of drug metabolism (Table 1). For lumefantrine, the isozyme specific hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint) was back-calculated using the Simcyp® retrograde calculator from the oral clearance and assuming CYP3A4 was the predominant isozyme for lumefantrine metabolism (White et al., 1999). This approach is essential in order to mechanistically model DDIs. Where necessary, the human jejunal effective permeability (Peff) and Kp scalar were further optimised for AL using a parameter estimate method within Simcyp® to yield optimal estimates for the absorption (Peff) and tissue distribution/Vss prediction (Kp scaler). Furthermore, for artemether, where necessary, the in-vitro metabolic clearance was optimised through the parameter estimation of the Inter System Extrapolation Factor (ISEF) (Table 1). Rifampicin and ketoconazole compounds were used in simulations without modification from the library of pre-validated drug molecules within the Simcyp® simulator, using a 1st-order absorption model and assuming dosing in solution form. Where Simcyp® ADAM (Advanced Dissolution Absorption Model) was used, an immediate release formulation with an applied diffusion layer model was utilised for modelling with literature-reported solubility parameters included. Where simulations were performed in paediatrics, all APIs were assumed to be dosed in solution form, mimicking the dispersible/crushed application of AL in paediatric subjects (World Health Organisation, 2016).  2.2.1 Artemether-lumefantrine DDI model development The successful development and validation of AL compounds within Simcyp® was followed by assessing the ability to predict DDIs in adults and paediatrics. All adult DDI simulations were, where possible, run identically to the reported clinical study with which the validation was conducted against, and primarily included matching age ranges, male-to-female ratios and identical dose/dosing intervals. In order to validate the capability of the model to predict a broad range of DDIs, the prevalidated Simcyp® in-built compounds ketoconazole and rifampicin were directly utilised in simulations as candidates to simulate CYP3A4 inhibition DDIs (ketoconazole) and CYP3A4 induction DDIs (rifampicin). A previously validated isoniazid compound file (Dennison et al., 2017) was used for all rifampicin DDI simulations to account for the impact of isoniazid mediated CYP3A4-inhibition associated with TB chemotherapy. All simulations included both rifampicin (as the primary perpetrator) and isoniazid (as the secondary perpetrators), however results are presented for the key interactions between AL and rifampicin only, and reflects the clinical net effect of CYP3A4 induction with the clinical use of the combination of rifampicin and isoniazid in DDI-focussed studies (George et al., 2012; Kay et al., 1985; Wanwimolruk et al., 1995). For paediatric DDI simulations (Step 4), a 100 subject simulation was run in a 10×10 trial (10 subjects per trial with 10 trials) to ensure that reasonable inter-/intra individual variability is captured within the model simulations. However, as simulations are not possible with defined age and weight ranges, pooling and post-processing of output data was conducted to match individuals to the required age-weight boundary conditions for the study.    2.3 Predictive performance Whilst no agreed criterion has been suggested for an ‘optimal’ predictive performance range, it is generally considered that a prediction to within 2-fold of the observed data is acceptable (Sager et al., 2015a). Given the wide inter-subject variability in artemether pharmacokinetics, we selected this 2-fold range (0.5–2.0) as our criterion for comparing Cmax and AUC parameters between model predictions and those clinically reported. Where a DDI was simulated, the model performance was primarily dictated by a comparison of the AUC ratio (ratio of AUC in the absence and presence of the perpetrator agent) (AUCr), with a prediction of AUCr to within 2-fold of the reported AUCr being considered as acceptable, with an AUCr >1.25 being indicative of an inhibition reaction whereas an AUCr <0.8 indicating an induction reaction whilst an AUC ratio of between 0.8 and 1.25 indicating no interaction.   2.4 Data analysis Unless otherwise stated, all simulations of plasma concentration-time profiles were presented as arithmetic mean and 5–95th percentiles. In circumstances where reported concentration-time profiles did not provide corresponding tabulated summary data, the observed data points were retrieved using the WebPlotDigitizer v3.10 (Rohatgi, 2014) and superimposed onto simulated profiles for visual predictive checks.

1750,S0928098717302725,Development of a paediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to assess the impact of drug-drug interactions in tuberculosis co-infected malaria subjects: A case study with artemether-lumefantrine and the CYP3A4-inducer rifampicin," 2 Methods All population based PBPK modelling was conducted using the virtual clinical trials simulator Simcyp® (Simcyp® Ltd., a Certara company, Sheffield, UK, Version 16) using either the pre-validated in-built ‘Healthy Volunteer’ or ‘Paediatric’ population groups. The latter population group accounts for age-related changes in systems-parameters such as organ volumes, organ perfusion and ontogeny of drug metabolising enzymes (Johnson, 2005) (Johnson, 2008) (Small et al., 2017) and allows for the prediction of drug behaviour in paediatric population groups. In the case of both models, population variability is accounted for by the inclusion of a variability metric (% coefficient variability) having been established from public health data bases such as the US National health and Nutrition Examination Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/).  2.1 Study design A four stage strategy was employed for model development and validation (Fig. 1 ). Step 1: this step focussed on the development of Simcyp® compound files and validation of simulations with published clinical studies. For artemether and lumefantrine, these included a study conducted in 120 adult subjects who were orally dosed the branded combination Coartem® (Huang & Rowland, 2012), and studies conducted in 16 subjects who were orally dosed the branded combiantion Riamet® (Lefevre et al., 2002b). For lumefantrine an additional study included a 6-dose study conducted in 17 subjects (Ashley et al., 2007). Step 2: this step focussed on the validation of the adult DDI predictions. CYP3A4 inhibition and induction mechanisms were simulated using ketoconazole and rifampicin respectively. Clinical studies demonstrating such a DDI were obtained from Lefèvre et al. who studied AL with ketoconazole (Lefevre et al., 2002b) (single dose of 80/480mg of AL and 5day treatment with ketoconazole) and Lamorde et al. (Lamorde et al., 2013b), who studied AL DDI with rifampicin where rifampicin was dosed at 10mg/kg for the duration of the study with AL dosed as six 80/480mg doses (12hourly) on days 8, 9 and 10. Step 3: this step focussed on the validation of artemether and lumefantrine model predictions in paediatrics. In these studies, weight bandings were simulated based on dosing strategies for AL if the clinical study did not use a weight normalised dosing method. Dosing boundaries were set at 1 tablet for 5–14.9kg, 2 tablets for 15–24.9kg and 3 tablets for 25–34.9kg and trials were run to ensure, where possible, an equal proportion of subjects were included into each distribution banding based on the total number of subjects recruited within each reported trial. Simulated profiles were body weight stratified and analysed accordingly. Clinical studies used are detailed the results Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Step 4: this step focussed on simulations to predict the impact of rifampicin-mediated DDIs on artemether and lumefantrine pharmacokinetics in children of 2–5years of age over a weight boundary of 5–14.9kg or 15–24.9kg. In these simulations, trials of 100 subjects were simulated and analysed with appropriate weight-based dosing (see above) and under treatment of rifampicin with AL. For all validation steps, unless otherwise stated, all observed data sets were obtained from ‘supervised’ administration groups in reported clinical studies and simulated under ‘fed’ conditions. Furthermore, unless otherwise stated all simulations included subjects of ?5years.   2.2 Artemether-lumefantrine model development The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters required to describe the pharmacokinetic properties of artemether, lumefantrine and isoniazid are detailed in Table 1 . For artemether, literature-reported isozyme specific hepatic intrinsic clearances were utilised for the description of drug metabolism (Table 1). For lumefantrine, the isozyme specific hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint) was back-calculated using the Simcyp® retrograde calculator from the oral clearance and assuming CYP3A4 was the predominant isozyme for lumefantrine metabolism (White et al., 1999). This approach is essential in order to mechanistically model DDIs. Where necessary, the human jejunal effective permeability (Peff) and Kp scalar were further optimised for AL using a parameter estimate method within Simcyp® to yield optimal estimates for the absorption (Peff) and tissue distribution/Vss prediction (Kp scaler). Furthermore, for artemether, where necessary, the in-vitro metabolic clearance was optimised through the parameter estimation of the Inter System Extrapolation Factor (ISEF) (Table 1). Rifampicin and ketoconazole compounds were used in simulations without modification from the library of pre-validated drug molecules within the Simcyp® simulator, using a 1st-order absorption model and assuming dosing in solution form. Where Simcyp® ADAM (Advanced Dissolution Absorption Model) was used, an immediate release formulation with an applied diffusion layer model was utilised for modelling with literature-reported solubility parameters included. Where simulations were performed in paediatrics, all APIs were assumed to be dosed in solution form, mimicking the dispersible/crushed application of AL in paediatric subjects (World Health Organisation, 2016).  2.2.1 Artemether-lumefantrine DDI model development The successful development and validation of AL compounds within Simcyp® was followed by assessing the ability to predict DDIs in adults and paediatrics. All adult DDI simulations were, where possible, run identically to the reported clinical study with which the validation was conducted against, and primarily included matching age ranges, male-to-female ratios and identical dose/dosing intervals. In order to validate the capability of the model to predict a broad range of DDIs, the prevalidated Simcyp® in-built compounds ketoconazole and rifampicin were directly utilised in simulations as candidates to simulate CYP3A4 inhibition DDIs (ketoconazole) and CYP3A4 induction DDIs (rifampicin). A previously validated isoniazid compound file (Dennison et al., 2017) was used for all rifampicin DDI simulations to account for the impact of isoniazid mediated CYP3A4-inhibition associated with TB chemotherapy. All simulations included both rifampicin (as the primary perpetrator) and isoniazid (as the secondary perpetrators), however results are presented for the key interactions between AL and rifampicin only, and reflects the clinical net effect of CYP3A4 induction with the clinical use of the combination of rifampicin and isoniazid in DDI-focussed studies (George et al., 2012; Kay et al., 1985; Wanwimolruk et al., 1995). For paediatric DDI simulations (Step 4), a 100 subject simulation was run in a 10×10 trial (10 subjects per trial with 10 trials) to ensure that reasonable inter-/intra individual variability is captured within the model simulations. However, as simulations are not possible with defined age and weight ranges, pooling and post-processing of output data was conducted to match individuals to the required age-weight boundary conditions for the study.    2.3 Predictive performance Whilst no agreed criterion has been suggested for an ‘optimal’ predictive performance range, it is generally considered that a prediction to within 2-fold of the observed data is acceptable (Sager et al., 2015a). Given the wide inter-subject variability in artemether pharmacokinetics, we selected this 2-fold range (0.5–2.0) as our criterion for comparing Cmax and AUC parameters between model predictions and those clinically reported. Where a DDI was simulated, the model performance was primarily dictated by a comparison of the AUC ratio (ratio of AUC in the absence and presence of the perpetrator agent) (AUCr), with a prediction of AUCr to within 2-fold of the reported AUCr being considered as acceptable, with an AUCr >1.25 being indicative of an inhibition reaction whereas an AUCr <0.8 indicating an induction reaction whilst an AUC ratio of between 0.8 and 1.25 indicating no interaction.   2.4 Data analysis Unless otherwise stated, all simulations of plasma concentration-time profiles were presented as arithmetic mean and 5–95th percentiles. In circumstances where reported concentration-time profiles did not provide corresponding tabulated summary data, the observed data points were retrieved using the WebPlotDigitizer v3.10 (Rohatgi, 2014) and superimposed onto simulated profiles for visual predictive checks.

1795,S0163445310001830,Effects of pay-for-performance system on tuberculosis default cases control and treatment in Taiwan," Research methods  Data sources National Health Insurance Research Dataset in Taiwan from 2002 to 2005 has been used for the study. Total study samples are 13,191 patients in the years 2002 and 2003, and 27,142 patients in the years 2004 and 2005. For the analysis of pay-for-performance program on TB default rate, additional data were also obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Dataset. These additional variables include patients’ gender, age, area of residence, patients’ ICD-9-CM codes, levels of comorbidity, notification physician, date of medical visits, date of inpatient/discharge, duration of drug therapy, notification hospital/institution, etc.   Inclusion and exclusion criteria The Department of Health and WHO 19  defined the “default rate” as the percent of patients who interrupt the treatment regime for 2 months or longer. The duration of default is calculated by taking the difference between a medical visit and the next visit when the gap is 2 months or more. The date of medical visits and duration of medication days provide information to understand the patients’ compliance behavior. Patient with as long as 4 months of treatment from start of treatment was included in the study since diagnosis errors are common in the beginning of TB treatment. The P4P on TB demonstration program was implemented in the central branch of TCDC (Center for Disease Control, Taiwan) in October, 2001. For the purpose of this analysis, the cases from the central branch of TCDC were excluded from the list of pre-P4P cases. Another 20,167 patients were excluded from the study because of diagnosis error in the early stage of treatment.   Data analysis Descriptive statistics were obtained for the number of default cases and default rate for TB patients for the years 2002–2005. Besides descriptive analysis, bivariate analysis was performed to understand the effects of “P4P on TB” program on the default rate or treatment interruption. Chi-square test and fishers’ exact test were used to compare patients’ default rates between pre-P4P and post-P4P, between P4P hospital and non-P4P hospital, and between P4P hospitals with and without case managers. To identify the factors affecting interruption from treatment in Taiwan, multivariate analysis was conducted. Since the outcome variable is dichotomous, the appropriate empirical model would be to use logistic regression equations. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the probability of interruption from treatment. The independent variables included in the analysis were gender, age, migration status, hospital characteristics, comorbidity level, levels of city development, city income, and physician resources. Level of comorbidity was followed by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) which was developed by Charlson et al. in 1987. 20  Deyo et al. adapted the CCI for use with ICD-9-CM administrative data by identifying specific ICD-9-CM code to represent each of the individual comorbid conditions in the original Charlson index. This study used this index to identify the levels of patients’ comorbidity. The higher the CCI points the more serious is the patients’ comorbid condition. Three CCI classes (no, mild, and severe) were defined as 0, 1, and ?2.  ",0

The present study reviewed TB cases with a report of an HIV test result from 1997 to 2006. TB cases with a known HIV test result were divided into two groups: HIV-positive and HIV-negative and the following characteristics were compared: demographic characteristics (age, sex, country of birth); the results of laboratory testing (smear microscopy and culture results for sputum, bronchial wash, gastro intestinal wash, lymph node biopsy, urine, cerebral spinal and other); diagnostic criteria (laboratory confirmed or clinical diagnosis); primary drug resistance (isoniazid (INH), rifampacin (RMP), pyrazinamide (PZA), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (SM)) 1   1 In the present study, the first-line anti-TB drugs included isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin, although streptomycin has been considered a second-line drug in Canada since 2005. ; site of disease (International Classification of Diseases version 9-ICD); treatment regimen (number and type of drugs); and treatment outcome as per WHO guidelines [7].

Epilepsy, liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and no evidence of drug use were mentioned in his anamnesis. A negative result of HIV status was found on testing. A chest X-ray showed infiltration on the left inferior lobe (Fig. 1 ). Patient was cured 6 months according to the category III as recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) in Guidelines for national programmes in second edition 1997 for new smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis. 9  Patient received directly observed therapy with a regimen of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamid in the initial phase. For continuation phase isoniazid and rifampicin were used for 4 months also under direct observation with good patient's compliance. The sputum was smear and culture negative during the whole treatment period. New pathological findings in the right middle and lower zone and left superior lobe were detected on regular control after 6 months of treatment on 2000. Sputum was culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.TB) and therefore the regimen was changed to unapplied drugs with the suspicion on resistant strain. Combination of streptomycin, ethambutol, ethionamid and tarofloxacin was applied. Sputum sample was sent to the National Reference Laboratory for drug sensitivity testing. The method of minimal inhibitory concentration proved the presence of multidrug-resistant M.TB with resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid. The regimen was adjusted to combination of amikacin, ethambutol, ofloxacin, ethionamid and pyrazinamid. Amikacin was applied for 3 months without any adverse events and without elevation of creatinine values. The 3 months duration of daily therapy of aminoglycoside was recommended by WHO from year 1997. The patient was in a good clinical status for the following 6 months. Bacteriological investigations of sputum were repeated and positive culture findings were confirmed during second and third year of treatment without any significant changes on the chest X-ray. Because of the unfavourable bacteriological results, susceptibility tests were repeated in 2002 and confirmed resistance to ethambutol. Therapy was adjusted again and combination of ofloxacin, ethionamid, pyrazinamid, and capreomycin was extended of sensitive drug cycloserine to ensure the favourable course and outcome of the therapy. The combination of all drugs was tolerated very well. Patients suffered from COPD and he was placed on bronchodilators. No interaction with antituberculous drugs was observed. Capreomycin was applied for 3 months only and therapy continued on regimen with remaining four drugs. Although patient was treated by combination of four sensitive drugs, the sputum started to be smear and culture positive intermittently in 2003–2005. Drug susceptibility tests were again repeated in year 2004 with the same resistance result as in 2002. On the chest X-ray bilateral infiltrations proved partial regression. The application of the regimen continued during 2006 and patient remained in the same clinical status. Sputum samples were examined weekly and they started to be smear and culture negative. Despite that the favourable bacteriological findings, the progression of infiltration on the chest X-ray was detected in 2006. During next several months the sputum samples and the clinical status of the patient changed to worse. He was tired, grew slim, suffering from dyspnoe, cough, sweating, and temperature. There were no signs of exacerbation of COPD, malignant disease or other underlying disease. The evidence of prolonged inflammation and progression of malnutrition increased and the chest X-ray proved bilateral worsening of infiltrates and cavities due to MDR TB (Fig. 2 ).

Sanitation and hygiene structure of the refugee camps in Sudan and Ethiopia are poorly structured and overcrowded with refugees (UNHCR, 2014). Life outside the refugee camps is worse. The immigrants have to live in small rooms in overcrowded condition. In Addis Ababa (capital city of Ethiopia) for example, up to eight people live in two small rooms (Al Jazeera, 2016).

1851,S0167587717301769,Animal tuberculosis maintenance at low abundance of suitable wildlife reservoir hosts: A case study in northern Spain," 2 Material and methods  2.1 Study area Castilla y León (CyL) is the largest autonomous region in Spain and occupies most of the northern Iberian plateau (94,226km2). It is divided into nine provinces and 103 local veterinary units (LVU; Fig. 1 ). Woodlands and scrublands occupy 21,191km2, representing 22% of the region, mainly in its northern and southern periphery (Espinosa Rincón, 2000). It has borders with the low-TB-prevalence Atlantic coastal regions (cattle TB herd prevalence <1% in 2014) in the north and with regions belonging to the high-TB-prevalence area of the southwestern quarter of the Iberian Peninsula (cattle TB herd prevalence 3.55–7.21% in 2014; Source: Ministry of Agriculture) in the south. The region of CyL has a strong tradition of livestock breeding, with over 3.6 million sheep, over 1 million cattle, 114,000 goats and 650,000 pigs of the often open-air bred Iberian breed. Beef cattle farming on open pastures occurs mainly on the borders of CyL, while dairy farming is more common in the central lowlands (see Appendix S1 in the Supplementary material).   2.2 Host data Information on livestock populations and their TB status, along with that of the surface of communal pastures, i.e., those shared by different herds of cattle with or without contact with sheep and goats, was available at a LVU scale. Information on wildlife included the number and location of fenced hunting estates. In the case of wild boar, the only wild ungulate present in all sampling units, we used a relative abundance index obtained by Acevedo et al. (2014b) who, in summary, modeled the wild boar relative abundance (animals hunted per 100Km2) on more than 6000 hunting estates. The model, which was validated beforehand using independent data, was then extrapolated in order to predict the species’ relative abundance in regions for which no data were available, such as CyL. No data on badger abundance was available. According to the Spanish mammal atlas, badgers are present in 583 of the 1066 10×10km squares in this region (Palomo et al., 2007). Between 2011 and 2015, a total of 7729 wild boar and 1729 wild ruminants (mostly red deer) were sampled by trained veterinarians during hunting events on unfenced hunting estates appertaining to 97 LVUs throughout CyL. The mandibular lymph nodes (LN) of wild boar were systematically sampled for microbiological cultures, while other organs were visually inspected and only collected if TB-compatible lesions were observed. In the case of ruminants, a pool containing the medial retropharyngeal, left bronchial and mediastinal LN was collected. If TB-compatible lesions were observed in other locations, samples of these organs were added to the pool for culture. In addition, 1058 wild ungulates, mostly wild boar, were sampled on 22 fenced hunting estates between 2010 and 2015 following the same protocols. Wildlife tissue samples were cultured using BACTEC MGIT960 Mycobacterial Detection System (Becton Dickinson, USA). Isolates were identified and characterized by means of Direct Variable Repeat (DVR)-spoligotyping (Kamerbeek et al., 1997). Data regarding the spoligotype pattern of MTC isolates from livestock was also available.   2.3 Modeling The spatial associations in the individual TB prevalence of different host species (namely cattle, goat and wild boar) were assessed using generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution (Zuur et al., 2009). Three models were performed, one for each host. In each model, the prevalence of the other hosts at LVU level, along with other variables at the same level, were included as predictors given their potential explanatory power: wild boar abundance index, percentage of extensive (beef) cattle farms, surface of communal pastures (cattle only; cattle and goat; and cattle and small ruminants – goat and sheep), and presence/absence of fenced wild ungulate populations (see Appendix S1). Wild boar MTC infection prevalence was considered as a predictor only for LVUs with n>30 sampled wild boar (see below). The hierarchical structure of the data signified that it was necessary to define the structured spatial random effect for the dependence among LVUs by using a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) (Lindgren et al., 2011), and this was also included in the models. The SPDE was calculated using a Delaunay triangulation from a matrix of Euclidean distances between the centroids of each LVU (e.g. Cameletti et al., 2013). As a first step, the prevalence of TB in each host was modeled solely in terms of random effects (SPDE). Explanatory variables were then added to this model following a forward stepwise procedure, using the deviance information criterion (DIC) to select the most parsimonious model, i.e., that with the lowest DIC value. Further details on the statistical rationale can be found in Garcia-Sáenz et al. (2014). The statistical significance of the variables in the models was assessed with 95% credible intervals (CR) obtained from the posterior probability distribution; a relation was significant if the 95% CR was greater (the variable increases the risk) or lower (it decreases the risk) than 0. All statistical models were performed using the R-INLA package (Schrödle and Held, 2011).  ",0
1885,S0741521406009323,Tuberculous pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery complicated by cutaneous tuberculosis of the foot: A case report," Case report A 69-year-old man presented at the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe right inguinal pain. There was no reported fever or history of trauma. The patient had a history of rheumatoid arthritis and had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) at the age of 18 years. Three years before admission, the patient underwent total left knee joint replacement surgery for severe joint destruction caused by septic arthritis that had developed after surgical excision of a Baker’s cyst. Long-term antibiotic therapy and surgical revision were subsequently required for persistent Staphylococcus aureus infection. At the time of admission for inguinal pain, the patient had no signs of active prosthetic infection and was no longer taking antibiotics. His medications included oral methotrexate (15 mg/week), which he had been taking for 2 years to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Upon examination, the patient was afebrile and palpation revealed a tender, pulsatile mass in the right inguinal area. Distal pulses were present. Leukocytosis was absent, but the serum level of protein C (91.3 mg/L) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32 mm/h) were elevated. Duplex imaging revealed a 2.0 × 2.5-cm dilatation of the right common femoral artery with a posterior communication to a heterogeneous saccular pseudoaneurysm that measured 3.0 × 2.2 × 4.0 cm. A tentative clinical diagnosis of an infected pseudoaneurysm was made, with the knee prosthesis as the most likely source of the seeding bacteria. Angiography was consistent with a contained ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery (Fig 1). No other aneurysm was detected elsewhere in the arterial tree. Cardiac echography was negative for endocarditis. A thoracic computed tomography scan revealed a right calcified fibrothorax, with no evidence of an active foci of pulmonary TB. The patient underwent surgery, which revealed a 2-cm-long fusiform common femoral artery aneurysm with a posterior wall perforation that led to the contained pseudoaneurysm. The extent of inflammation did not preclude in situ arterial reconstruction. After complete excision of the involved segment and debridement of surrounding cellulitic tissue, continuity was re-established via a reversed femoral vein harvested from the middle third of the ipsilateral thigh. The vein graft was covered by a rotated sartorius muscle. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and within 4 days the patient was discharged to his home under ambulatory care and received vancomycin intravenously. Gram stains of tissue samples harvested from the arterial wall revealed few neutrophiles, but there were no bacteria. Ziehl-Neelsen and auramine stains were negative. Mycobacterial cultures on Löwenstein-Jensen medium were performed on the intraaneurysmal thrombi, as dictated by routine protocol for surgical room specimens, with negative initial cultures and Gram stains. The cultures exhibited growth of M tuberculosis both on solid and in liquid medium. The patient was readmitted, but an extensive workup for active M tuberculosis was negative. Triple antimycobacterial chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide was initiated, and the methotrexate treatment was discontinued. Microscopic examination of the resected portion of the aneurysm was reviewed and showed nonspecific inflammatory reaction. No caseating granulomas were found, and staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Two weeks after the operation, an erythematous nodular lesion on the dorsum of the right first toe developed that was suggestive of a metastatic abscess. The abscess was drained, and no acid-fast bacilli were isolated from the culture. Ziehl-Neelsen and auramine stains were negative, but polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed the presence of M tuberculosis DNA, which confirmed the diagnosis of a tuberculous abscess. Transient erythema nodosum of the right leg later developed and persisted for approximately 3 weeks. After 6 months of treatment, a slightly erythematous, nonfluctuant nodular lesion had developed on the plantar surface of the right foot. Application of pressure to the plantar surface resulted in the release of friable yellow tissue that was typical of lupus vulgaris (Fig 2). Tissue cultures and PCR were negative for M tuberculosis. Histologic examination of biopsy specimens revealed epithelioid cell tubercles that were surrounded by dense lymphocytic infiltration without caseation, compatible with lupus vulgaris (Fig 3).  After 11 months of followup, all cutaneous lesions were healed. The patient was treated for a total of 12 months and is completely asymptomatic 18 months after surgery. ",0

1927,S0307904X13000929,A mathematical model of tuberculosis transmission with heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and progression under a treatment regime for infectious cases," 2 Host genetics and tuberculosis Why do some people who are exposed to M. tuberculosis not become infected or, if infected, not develop to active tuberculosis? Several studies had gone into investigating the effect of certain genes on susceptibility or resistance to tuberculosis. For instance, in [15], it was reported that one or multiple genes might provide certain people with resistance to tuberculosis infection. The findings in [15] shows the existence of a chromosomal site, or a locus, that controls resistance to TB infection. Out of the 128 families studied, who come from an area in South Africa with high tuberculosis rates, after considering non genetic factors such as age, 20% of individuals show natural resistance. As explained by one of the researchers, “In other words, some people seem to have a particular genetic heritage that makes them naturally resistant to [M.tuberculosis] infection”. However, even before the study reported in [15], the involvement of human genes in tuberculosis has been suggested by numerous epidemiological observations [1,16–21]. These studies employed, amongst other methods, large scale control studies of target genes, family-based linkages including twin studies and investigation of rare individuals with exceptional mycobacteria susceptibility. The studies enable identification of the particular host gene that influences susceptibility to tuberculosis. Several studies have shown that a person’s resistance level to the bacterium infection correlates with the region of his or her ancestry and that the ancestors of more-susceptible persons tend to come from areas once free of tuberculosis [10,22]. Greenwood et.al. in [23] identified a major gene in a Canadian study that appears to control the progression from infected status (i.e. individuals with positive tuberculin skin test) to affected status (i.e. individuals with tuberculosis). The results of the study showed that in certain genetic epidemiological contexts, predisposition to tuberculosis results mostly from the major gene. Susceptibility of tuberculosis is multifactorial. Host genetic factors such as the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) and non-HLA genes that are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis usually serves as genetic markers to predispose or predetermine the development of the disease. These markers are useful in understanding the immune mechanism of susceptibility or resistance to tuberculosis [24]. Increased susceptibility and resistance to more than 500 diseases has been shown to be associated with various HLA antigens, alleles, or haplotypes [1,25]. The level and type of immune response to a particular pathogen may vary among populations that have different distributions of HLA molecules. Several studies of HLA association with pulmonary tuberculosis have been carried out in populations in China, Indonesia and Russia (See Ref. in [24]). In fact, Selvaraj in [24] listed some important candidate gene variants of HLA and non-HLA genes with the susceptibility or resistance to tuberculosis in Indian population. Table 1  lists some of the common classifications and shows the allele that is strongly associated with the active stage and others that are commonly associated with active TB. The effect of some non-HLA genes on susceptibility has also been reported in [24,20]. For instance, in the study in [20], it was shown that variation in the human homolog NRAMP1 is associated with altered susceptibility to smear-positive tuberculosis amongst some individuals in the Gambia, West Africa. It was then concluded that the NRAMP1 gene governs susceptibility to tuberculosis. Although the study design used in [20] did not distinguish between susceptibility to infection with M. tuberculosis and susceptibility to disease progression, it is possible that the NRAMP1 could affect susceptibility to disease progression especially for individuals with this gene who are already affected with the bacteria. The study in [20] concluded that there are genetic variations in NRAMP1 that affects susceptibility to tuberculosis in West Africans. In a study carried out, also in The Gambia (West Africa) [34], on pulmonary TB patients, the tt genotype of TaqI polymorphism of VDR gene was found less frequently in cases of pulmonary TB, suggesting that this genotype may be associated with resistance to pulmonary TB whereas ApaI polymorphism of the VDR gene showed no association. In a recent study on the genetic diversity of tuberculosis in Jos, Nigeria, reported in [8], several strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) species were isolated. Using the method of spoligotyping, the study showed that LAM10 (which is strongly associated with tuberculosis) isolates were abundant in the population of MTC isolates from Jos, Nigeria. The study then concluded that the extensive TB epidemic in the area under study was caused by one successful M. tuberculosis family, dominated by the LAM10 subfamily. In summary, the information above clearly indicates the existence of heterogeneities in susceptibility and resistance to TB and its effect on the dynamics of tuberculosis; susceptibility to progression (from the latent stage to the active stage) can also be linked to some genetic markers. The identification of host genes with their functional alleles controlling the response to mycobacterial infection is fundamental to the definition of new prevention (e.g. early detection and prolonged follow-up of high risk individuals) and treatment (e.g. aimed at restoring partially deficient immune responses) strategies for tuberculosis [10]. The purpose of this paper is to investigate, using mathematical models, the impact of genetic heterogeneity on the spread of TB. We will consider genetic susceptibility to infection and susceptibility to disease progression. We will tailor our model in the light of the work done by S-F Hsu Schmitz on genetic heterogeneity and its impact on the dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a homosexual population [35,36]. In fact, Castillo-Chavez and Song in [37] listed the effect of genetics on the dynamics of tuberculosis as a challenging area worth investigating and suggested the fine leads found in [35,36]. There are interesting articles that discusses the issue of genetic heterogeneity on tuberculosis dynamics. For example, the articles by Murphy et al. in [1,2] examined this issue using a system of six ordinary differential equations, whereby the susceptible, latently infected and infectious classes were divided into two sub classes each: a sub class for individuals with a susceptible genotype and another for individuals with a neutral (without a susceptible) genotype. The work in [2] included the effect of treatment (of the infected classes) on the the overall dynamics of the disease on the population. However, both models did not take into cognisance the effect of exogenous reinfection on the dynamics of the disease, an effect that is generally accepted as very crucial on TB epidemics [38–40]. Also, with the above information on specific genes, classifications can be broadly made for the susceptibles as to having no, partial or full natural resistance to tuberculosis and the latently infected as to being rapid, normal or very slow (or no) progressors. With the above, we can deal with the fact that gene differentiability occurs with susceptibles becoming infected (latent) and the infected becoming infectious (having active tuberculosis) so that some susceptibles, due to the gene, can never become infected (latently) and some latent cases can never progress to becoming infectious (active). More so, we want to formulate a mathematical model that has separate classes for the treated individuals. ",0

In March 2012 she developed cough, and fever with nightly sweating lasting for 2 months; BK and sputum culture were requested, both negative. She received IFX in May and in June went to a review visit referring multiple respiratory infections during that time. In August she was assessed by Orthopedics, finding fever, pain and swelling of the right knee; discharged with a suspected prosthetic infection (Fig. 1A). In November, she was hospitalized in Internal Medicine (IM) for partial bowel obstruction and was discharged on prednisone 15mg/day; during admission, a computed tomography (Fig. 1B) was performed, showing a pulmonary nodule indicative of granuloma and chest and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. In January 2013 she came to the Rheumatology clinic due to knee pain, and IFX was suspended; she also was assessed by IM, who recommended surgery for the persistent intestinal subocclusion. In April, she was evaluated by General Surgery and operated. Pathologic examination showed necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa in the small intestine; microbiological study was negative for Mycobacterium. Rifater® was begun and QuantiFERON® performed, which was negative. In June, she went to Rheumatology for leg edema and pain in the right knee; Doppler ultrasound was performed, showing a cystic mass of 10cm, which was drained and analyzed; an MRI was also requested (Fig. 1D).

1993,S0303846716300026,Two approaches for treating upper thoracic spinal tuberculosis with neurological deficits in the elderly: A retrospective case-control study," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Patient clinical characteristics From January 2006 to December 2010, 34 upper thoracic spinal TB patients with neurological deficits were enrolled in this study. The ethics committee of Xiangya Hospital of Central-South University approved this study. Informed consent was also obtained from all participants. Patients included 20 males and 14 females with a mean age (according to the Chinese standard) of 69.8±4.3 years at the time of surgery (range=62–78 years; Table 1 ). All patients experienced constitutional symptoms, including back pain, weakness, sweats, moderate fever, weight loss, and neurological dysfunction; the mean symptom duration was six months. None of the patients were HIV positive or had active lung TB. TB diagnosis was based on clinical presentation, laboratory examinations, and imaging results, including plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [16]. In the 34 patients, the involved vertebrae are from T1 to T4 (9 cases in T1, 18 in T2, 23 in T3, 16 in T4). American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale was applied to evaluate neurological status. Five patients were grade B, 20 were grade C, and 9 were grade D. Initial and preoperative pain, including thoracic back pain, was assessed based on a visual analog scale (VAS). The Cobb’s angle for all cases was evaluated. Most patients had multiple comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis B, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (Table 1). Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients aged >60 years, (2) patients had neurological deficits and bone destruction of various degrees with limited paravertebral abscess, (3) lesions confined to a mono-segment or two adjacent segments, (4) the absence of an extensive TB abscess, (5) insensitive to conservative treatment (anti-TB drugs and ambulation). Patients who satisfied inclusion criteria were divided into two groups: 18 cases underwent surgical management using single-stage transpedicular debridement, decompression, interbody bone fusion, and instrumentation via the posterior-only approach (Group A). Another 16 cases that underwent anterior debridement, bone grafting, and posterior instrumentation in a single- or two-stage procedure served as the control group (Group B). The same team reviewed all surgical indications and performed the operations. What needs to be stressed is that cases in Group B (combined anterior and posterior approach) were collected earlier, but cases in Group A (posterior-only) were collected in recent years.   2.2 Preoperative procedure A mean time of 15.7±1.9 days (14–21 days) prior to the surgery, patients were administered standard antituberculosis chemotherapy with isoniazid (5mg/kg/d), rifampicin (10mg/kg/d), ethambutol (15mg/kg/d), and pyrizinamide (25mg/kg/d). Concurrent diseases were routinely controlled. However, the patients’ pain and neurologic status had no obvious improvement during the oral anti-TB drugs. When anemia and hypoproteinemia were completely rectified, the surgery was carried out.   2.3 Operative procedure In Group A, only the posterior approach was performed. The procedure was as follows. With the assistance of C-arm fluoroscopy, pedicle screws were placed two levels superior and inferior to the level of the affected vertebrae. If the upper part of the vertebral body was not destroyed, screws were also placed in the diseased vertebrae. A pre-bent rod on the mildly affected side temporarily connected the screws to avoid instability and spinal cord injury during decompression and focal debridement. Decompression was completed by an expanded hemi-laminectomy on the more severely affected side of the lesion segment. Different curette sizes and angles were applied to remove the lesion through the healthy, bleeding bone using the posterolateral approach. The insides of the pedicles were reserved for safety. The ribs, intercostal arteries, and thoracic nerve roots on the focal level were sacrificed for better exposure, if necessary. The temporary rod was switched to the other side, and the same decompression and debridement were performed if the bilateral vertebral body were severely affected. Pus and necrotic tissue were eliminated by pressurized washing and negative pressure suction. Rectification of the deformity was achieved with the help of the compression and stretch of the internal fixation instrument. To promote bone fusion, block-sized allogeneic bone with an appropriate shape was imbedded in the interbody; autogenous or allogeneic particulate bone was implanted in the posterolateral vertebral body. In Group B, posterior instrumentation without fusion was performed first, followed by anterior debridement and allografting in a single- or two-stage procedure. The procedure of anterior surgery was as follows. The patients were placed in a lateral decubitus positions, leaving the severely involved side upward, and an incision parallel with posterior midline, 6–7cm lateral to spinous process, was made according to the tuberculosis lesion segment. After routine extrapleural exposure, the posterior part of the rib articulated with the involved vertebrae body and the involved transverse process were removed. Then, the tuberculous focus, including collapsed vertebras, in-between intervertebral disc and cold abscess, was completely removed through to healthy bleeding bone for spinal cord decompression. Expanding the 2 immediate healthy vertebrae, 2 suitable autologous rib strut grafts (from above removed rib) were harvested between them to complete interbody fusion. Streptomycin (1g) and isoniazid (0.3g) were locally placed in the surgical area and drainage was performed after the previously described procedures. The intraoperative biopsy was obtained, and debrided material was sent for mycobacterial culture and histopathological examination.   2.4 Postoperative procedure Typically, the drainage tube was removed when drainage flow was less than 30ml per 24h. Intravenous antibiotics were administered to prevent infection, and nutritional support and improvement was regularly performed. Standard anti-TB chemotherapy, mentioned previously, was performed for 12–18 months postoperatively. One week after surgery, the bed was elevated at an angle of no more than 45° to promote expectoration and improve heart and lung functioning. After remaining in bed for two weeks postoperatively, patients were allowed to gradually start walking under the effective support of a cervical thoracic neck brace for 3–6 months. According to each patient’s general condition, early rehabilitation training and application of physical therapy were administered to prevent blood clots and improve nerve functioning.   2.5 Follow-up indices After surgery, a routine X-ray or CT was obtained to assess the extent of decompression and placement of the graft and instrumentation. Routine blood and hepatic examinations were administered to monitor for any adverse reactions to the anti-TB agents. The following indices were recorded preoperatively, postoperatively, and during follow-up: (1) Cobb’s angle, (2) neurological status according to Frankel classification, (3) ESR, and (4) VAS pain score.   2.6 Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0. Changes in laboratory and physical parameters between the two groups were compared using the Student–Newman–Keuls test. A rank sum test was used to analyze any discrepancy in normal data distributions; significance level was 0.05.  ",0
2015,S0377123717309516,SYNOVIAL TUBERCULOSIS — TWO UNUSUAL CASES: A Case Report," Discussion About 1% of patient with tuberculosis have osteoarticular involvement [4]. Localised involvement of tendon sheaths is rare. The wrist and hands are involved in 0.7% to 5% of all cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis [1]. The disease may involve the tendon sheaths, joints or metacarpal bones. The flexor tendon sheaths are most commonly affected by tuberculosis in the hand. Tuberculous tenosynovitis results in insidiously developing progressive swelling and inflammation of tendon sheath. It is rarely associated with active pulmonary tuberculosis. The tuberculous tenosynovitis may be due to direct inoculation of the bacilli as used to occur in the past in cow handlers with the organism involved being mostly Mycobacterium bovis [5]. Now most cases of tenosynovitis are believed to be due to haematogenous dissemination from a primary focus, usually the lungs. The primary focus generally heals without clinical evidence of disease, but the secondary focus may become active years late [1]. The evolution of the disease is very slow. Early symptoms are so mild that it may be several years before the patient seeks treatment. The disease starts as a simple inflammation of tendon sheaths with serous exudate and fibrinous deposits. The sheath thickens and becomes granular and later exudate turns seropurulent. The synovial membrane becomes dull, red, villous and covered with fibrinous exudate which floats and accumulates into ‘melon seed’ or ‘rice’ bodies. They are composed of laminated fibrin. Occasionally acid-fast bacilli may be demonstrated in the centre of these bodies. At a later stage the disease spreads to involve the tendons proper and the surrounding tissue leading to tendon rupture, sinus formation and seropurulent discharge. Fever and general symptoms are usually absent [6]. Tuberculous infection of a bursa without involvement of adjacent joint is a rare occurrence [3]. Stewart [7] in 1933 and Kelly et al [8] in 1963 reported cases of tuberculous prepatellar bursitis without involvement of knee joint following injury. Direct inoculation of infection into infected bursae has been postulated in these cases [3] though haematogenous dissemination from a small undetected primary focus cannot be ruled out. Infections of bursae are more usually caused by a number of organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and various fungi. Rarely Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other atypical mycobacteria are the offending organisms. Thus the treating clinician should consider the possibility of mycobacterial infection in the work-up of bursitis [3]. The diagnosis of tuberculosis can be based on any of the following criteria: 1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis grown on culture 2. Biopsy material showing caseating granuloma typical of tuberculosis, sometimes accompanied by demonstration of acid fast bacilli [1]. Lesions in both patients in this report showed classical macroscopic features. Histopathologically both the lesions showed classical epithelioid cell granulomas with Langhan's type giant cells and areas of caseation consistent with tuberculosis. In both the patients the lesions were excised and full course of antituberculous chemotherapy was given. Surgical procedures combined with full doses of antituberculous chemotherapy offer the best results in cases of synovial tuberculosis involving tendon sheaths and bursae. ",0

Livestock farming practices here are representative of many mountainous regions around the world. Furthermore, despite over 25 years of test-and-slaughter both diseases are still present in this cattle population. Cattle farming in Cantabria and Asturias is characterised by seasonal management. Between April and November most cattle herds are kept grazing at high altitudes in the mountains, with different herds often sharing grazing. In winter, cattle are moved to lowland areas and kept in barns that may have access to small outdoor yards or fields. As conditions in each location are so different, the risk factors for disease need to be considered separately for summer and winter farms.   2.2 Study design A literature review of the known risk factors for TB and brucellosis was conducted in Web of Knowledge and PubMed, using search terms ‘risk’ and ‘risk factor’ in combination with the common name for each disease, or the Latin names for the bacteria. Questionnaires were developed to cover a range of farm characteristics, farm management practices, and external factors that might affect cattle on the farm, including the presence of wildlife (Table 1 ), and included the risk factors identified in the literature review. Respondent contact details and the disease status of all farms in the study areas were obtained from government records. Each disease was considered separately and farms were considered positive if they had one or more positive test results in the 5 years prior to the interviews. TB tests used the single intradermal cervical tuberculin test and were always confirmed by culture (RASVE, 2014a). Brucellosis was diagnosed with serological tests (RASVE, 2014b). The target population of all cattle farmers in the study area were classified by their farms' infected or disease-free status for each disease, after which respondents were selected at random within these groups.   2.3 Questionnaires Details of potential participants and the disease status of their cattle were provided by regional agricultural authorities. Individuals were approached at random within the disease positive or negative groups. All interviews were conducted in person to avoid any bias caused by respondent illiteracy, generally in situ at the respondents' farms. Respondents received information about the purpose of the work and our intended use of the data, and oral consent to participate was then obtained (Table S1). All interviewers were qualified vets engaged in full time scientific research and were aware of the importance of reducing bias. Questionnaires were conducted in summer 2010 in Cantabria (n?=?63 farms) and winter 2012 in Asturias (n?=?37 farms). Sample sizes were reached by conducting as many interviews as possible in the time available. In total 114 farmers were approached and 100 participated, giving a response rate of 88% and data for 100 different cattle herds.   2.4 Data validation Heat and motion sensitive infrared-triggered camera traps (IR-3BU® and IR-5®, Leaf River Outdoor Products, Taylorsville, MS, USA and NightTrakker NT50, Uway Outdoor Products, Atlanta, GA, USA) were placed on the winter barns and pastures of 18 of the study farms, in Cantabria (n?=?7) and Asturias (n?=?11), whilst cattle were present. Up to eight cameras were placed on each farm as required to cover farm resources (food and water), buildings and control areas, each for a minimum of 15 days. These were used to observe wildlife visits to the farm, and provided an opportunity to verify the respondents' reports of the presence or absence of wildlife.   2.5 Statistical analyses In the final database, some variables were created by dividing by farm or herd size – for example herd size divided by the farm size became the stocking density (Table S2). All analyses were conducted in R, version 2.15.3. As so many variables were collected, univariable binomial generalised linear models (GLMs) were used to screen which risk factors were the most important statistical predictors for the presence of each disease. Those predictor variables that were considered significant were then tested for collinearity with each other using an appropriate correlation test. Collinearity was tested using Spearman's rank tests and Pearson's correlations as a correlation of over 0.7, and in Chi squared tests as a p value of <0.1, as appropriate for the variables concerned. Where significant correlations between predictor variables were observed, the variable most strongly associated with disease presence was chosen. Information theoretic analysis generates a set of models made from different combinations of the terms in a ‘global model’, containing all the variables of interest (Burnham et al., 2010). This allows for the identification of the important variables after full consideration of their significance relative to others. The AICc (second-order Akaike information criterion), recommended for use with smaller sample sizes, is calculated for each of these models and used to compare them. Models with a delta value (the difference between the lowest AICc scoring model and each other model) of less than 6 were selected to form the ‘confidence set’, following Symonds and Moussalli (2010) recommendation that models with a delta score of less than 6 should not be discounted. Full model averaging gives estimates for each variable derived from all models in the confidence set. The adjusted R 2 goodness of fit is shown for each model, and model residuals were assessed for normality and independence. The evidence ratio shows how many times better the ‘best’ model is than each other model. Experimenter bias was investigated in a multivariable GLM including all variables that were used in each global model. For the analysis of data on farmer opinions, and to compare camera trap data with respondent reports of the presence of wildlife, univariable GLM models were constructed to complement descriptive statistics. The variables remaining after the correlation tests were entered into a multivariable GLM for each disease. Known risk factor variables identified in the literature review were also included and together these formed the ‘global model’ for information theoretic analysis. The literature review identified TB risk factors of herd size, cattle movement activities, the presence of wildlife and contact between cattle herds. For brucellosis they were herd size, cattle movements and the use of rented pastures. This allowed for understanding of the relative importance of the questionnaire variables. Biologically meaningful interactions between the terms in each global model were also included.  ",0

Slashed sections showed that the spleen was almost occupied by a 15-cm mass. Hematoxylin–eosin staining showed multiple granulomas with large caseation areas. No acid-fast bacilli were found. The remaining tissue was processed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Genotype® MTBC kit, Hain, Germany). Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA was detected in PCR analysis. A second test was performed to study the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern using the GenoType® MTBDRplus kit (Hain, Germany). Interestingly, rifampicin and isoniazid (high and low level) genes were detected (Fig. 2 ). A comprehensive review of her medical records showed that she had been diagnosed with Bazin's indurated erythema 24 years before. She was treated with rifampicin and isoniazid for 3 months plus isoniazid for 3 additional months, thus explaining the presence of the resistance genes in the analysis. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) diagnosis prompted the initiation of antimicrobial therapy with ethambutol (800 mg daily), pyrazinamide (1500 mg daily), and moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) for 2 months followed by another 10 months with ethambutol and moxifloxacin. She successfully completed the treatment and is doing well on follow-up 6 months later.",0
2143,S1472979216303997,Association of pellicle growth morphological characteristics and clinical presentation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study design The study was a longitudinal laboratory study that evaluated association between TDM produced by MTB strains collected at pulmonary or extrapulmonary sites. The sampling frame included a list of de-identified clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) along with details of site of isolation and virulence genetic group which was based on spoligotyping. The isolates were chosen from genetic groups to represent Beijing and Non-Beijing families [31]. The clinical isolates were grown as pellicle cultures in an effort to get the most accurate total of TDM produced. As TDM is constantly released from the MTB cell surface, submerged cultures with surfactant releases TDM into the culture broth, where it would be more difficult to isolate. As a pellicle culture, the released TDM spreads as a thin film on the air-water interphase of the culture broth, allowing collection of TDM that is no longer associated with the MTB cell wall. Clinical isolates that were not able to be grown as a pellicle culture were eliminated from further evaluation.   2.2 Culture Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Remel, PA) with 10% supplement containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) and 2% dextrose (Sigma) was used for surface pellicle growth. No Tween 20 was added. A pellet of organisms was suspended in 1 ml of sterile water, sonicated, and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min. The organisms were then re-suspended in 200 ?l petroleum ether. The re-suspended sample was divided into two equal parts to initiate the cultures in duplicate in 6-well plates with 6–8 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 broth in each well. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2.   2.3 Pellicle morphology The cultures were observed microscopically at 20× magnification, as well as macroscopically, twice a week for six weeks. Growth characteristics observed included duration for appearance of growth (in weeks), cording (early or late), spreading (continuous or non-continuous), climbing (presence or absence), and thickness (thin or thick). These characteristics were noted on a spreadsheet for all isolates for statistical analysis. Duration of appearance of growth was recorded as time (in weeks) when growth became visible under a phase contrast microscope at 20× magnification. This was recorded as 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks, following which the strain were entered as no growth. Early cording was described as appearance of cording on 20× magnification under a phase contrast microscope in less than 1 week of appearance of growth. Continuous growth was described as a non-discreet film of growth on the surface visible macroscopically, while climbing growth was depicted by macroscopically visible growth on the walls of the well.   2.4 TDM extraction Four week old cultures were harvested into pre-weighed glass tubes, centrifuged to a pellet, washed and centrifuged again at 2500 rpm for 30 min to remove the media. Surface TDM was extracted 3 times using petroleum ether and carried out as previously described12. The extract was then solubilized in chloroform-methanol (2:1) and then analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC).   2.5 Thin layer chromatography (TLC) TLC was standardized and compared against a TDM standard (Sigma). TLC was performed on Whatman K6F silica gel, 5 × 10 cm, 60 A plates. Each plate was inoculated with 10 ?l each of a standard TDM (diluted to 1 mg/ml) and 2 clinical isolates. The plates were run in elution buffer: chloroform, methanol, and ammonium hydroxide (90:10:1). TLC visualized with 5% sulfuric acid- 0.5% alpha napthol in 100% ethanol as the charring reagent. Amount of TDM was normalized against the wet weight of the MTB pellet taken prior to TDM extraction. Serial dilutions of the TDM extracted from the clinical isolates were made and run on TLC plates along with known standards of TDM. The concentration of the TDM on the TLC plates was calculated using densitometry software (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda, MD).   2.6 Statistics Prevalence rates and prevalence rate ratios were calculated for high TDM production in pulmonary and extrapulmonary MTB strains. All variables were compared using OneWay ANOVA or Student's T test where appropriate. A p-value of <0.05 was taken as significant. The graphs were prepared using GraphPad (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Based on the expected difference (0.4 and 0.1), each group (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) needed to have a sample size of 49 each for a power of 90% at alpha 0.05. We started with 90 (45 in each group), but ended with a total of 79 isolates that grew as pellicles, which translates to a power of 81.9%.  ",0

Data from notified cases for the years 1998–2002 inclusive were analysed and any gaps in data filled by individual enquiry. A questionnaire in English, Urdu and Gujerati, was sent to ISC patients registered with two primary care practices in Blackburn in 2002. Data were collected on place of birth, ethnic origin, year of first arrival and all visits to the ISC including the length of stay. These practices had participated in a community asthma prevalence survey in 1991, when the demographics of their ISC population were identical to those from the 1991 Census. 3  The data was put in a worksheet by a different doctor for cases (LPO) and controls (HS) and was analysed by importing into SPSS. Cases and controls were matched for age and sex. Chi-squared tests were initially used to examine associations, and logistic regression was used to find odds ratios as a measure of association of case status with risk variables and to find confidence intervals for them. The variables were examined both individually and in combination, using both forward and backward selection as modelling strategies. ",0
2204,S0169500209003183,"Lung cancer risk and cigarette smoking, lung tuberculosis according to histologic type and gender in a population based case–control study"," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study population Cases were recruited from the Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (KATRD), a nationwide hospital-based lung cancer study conducted in 1998 where histologically confirmed incident lung cancer cases (n =4210) diagnosed in 1997 were registered in the database. Of these cases, after excluding patients with metastatic lung cancer from other primary sites, clinically diagnosed cases without pathologic verification (n =118), and overlapping cases diagnosed at more than one hospital (n =298), there were 3794 subjects. Details of the KATRD lung cancer study have been previously reported [16]. We selected controls from Chungju, a site of the Korean Multi-Center Cancer Cohort (KMCC) that is a prospective community cohort study formed to investigate the relationship between risk factors and cancer from 1996 to 2004. The KMCC study design and sampling strategy have been described in detail elsewhere [17]. In brief, the KMCC population was recruited from four sites, Chungju, Haman, Uljin, Youngil, and Chungju is the largest site that is composed of both urban and rural subjects while the other three sites are predominantly rural subjects. Because the KATRD case population was recruited from urban as well as rural areas, we selected subjects who were cancer free when registered in 1997 in Chungju (n =1135) to serve as our controls. Table 1  presents the cases and controls according to sex and age. There was a significant difference between the two groups according to these variables. Because of the sex ratio and in order to maximize the frequency in a cell, we matched cases to controls 2:1 for males and 1:1 for females. For both genders we matched according to age (?44, 45–69, and ?70 years old). Finally, we selected 918 male cases (448 SqCC, 211 ADCC, 167 SmCC) and 459 controls, and 620 female cases (117 SqCC, 324 ADCC, 87 SmCC) and 620 controls.   2.2 Data collection We conducted interview-based questionnaires and collected information on demographic characteristics, history of cigarette smoking, history of pulmonary diseases, including lung tuberculosis, family history of lung cancer, and occupational history of high risk job including exposure to asbestos, coal, welding, and cokes oven. For smoking, we collected information on lifestyle smoking habits (never, ex, and current smokers). Among subjects who ever smoked, we collected additional information on number of years smoked and amount of cigarettes smoked per day. Information on past and current history of pulmonary diseases such as lung tuberculosis was obtained via chest X-rays and self-reported questionnaires at the time of enrollment in the KMCC and the KATRD. For lung cancer cases, additional information, including histologic type, cancer stage, symptoms, diagnostic tools, and treatment was collected from medical records.   2.3 Statistical analysis We used unconditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the risk of lung cancer according to the three major histologic types stratified by gender. The OR (95% CI) for cigarette smoking was adjusted for age and tuberculosis (ever vs. never). The OR (95% CI) for past and current history of lung tuberculosis, family history of lung cancer, and occupational history of high risk job was adjusted for age and smoking status (ever vs. never). The OR (95% CI) for the combined effect of smoking and tuberculosis was adjusted for age. When exposure was divided into three or more categories, we conducted test for linear trend to assess a dose–response relationship. We conducted polytomous logistic regression to compare the OR (95% CI) of the histologic types. When the p-value in polytomous logistic regression was significant, we computed p-values for heterogeneity between the two case groups after Bonferroni correction. We also computed p-interaction for gender. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.1.  ",0
2223,S0018442X1100028X,New skeletal tuberculosis cases in past populations from Western Hungary (Transdanubia)," Palaeopathological research of skeletal TB in Hungary Paleopathological studies of the distribution, antiquity and epidemiology of TB have previously been based on osteoarchaeological material from the eastern part of Hungary, mainly the Great Plain (Donoghue et al., 2005; Haas et al., 1999; Marcsik et al., 2002, 2006, 2007; Pálfi and Marcsik, 1999). In addition, there is one description of a severe case of skeletal TB (spinal TB and spina ventosa), which originated on the Great Plain (Ba?ka-Topola) at a site now in Serbia (Farkas et al., 1976). The Dominican Church of Vác, a town near Budapest, is very important, because of the large number of spontaneously mummified persons that were buried there mainly in the 18th century. In total, 265 individuals in coffins and another remains of approximately 46 individuals from an ossuary were found, and among them, morphological and radiological studies revealed cases of spinal TB (Pott's disease and other vertebral destructions). Based on molecular analysis, the prevalence of TB was very high (Donoghue et al., 2011; Fletcher et al., 2003a,b; Pálfi et al., 2004; Pap et al., 1999, 2002, 2008; Spigelman et al., 2006). In Western Hungary (Transdanubia), only isolated examples have been reported. An adult spinal TB case was described by Merczi (2001), and another adult case suggestive of spinal TB, dated to the 16th century, was reported by Éry (1982). The Székesfehérvár burial-ground includes skeletal material dated to various centuries; there, spinal TB was diagnosed in four cases (Donoghue and Spigelman, 2008; Éry et al., 2008a,b). Another case of spinal TB was described in material from Zalavár-Vár (Acsádi et al., 1962). The purpose of the current study was to map the occurrence of skeletal TB in various centuries in Western Hungary, Transdanubia, and to present new cases we have found. ",0
2235,S0277953603006269,Sociocultural aspects of tuberculosis: a literature review and a case study of immigrant tuberculosis," Literature review In this section, previous studies examining the social and cultural aspects of tuberculosis are reviewed. A Medline search on keyword—tuberculosis published in three major sociomedical journals (Social Science & Medicine, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, and Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry) between January 1990 and June 2003 was performed to compile the main body of literature to be reviewed. In addition, relevant articles cited in this core literature are also reviewed. In general, previous sociocultural studies of tuberculosis can be classified according to their focus on one of the following factors: culture, environment, or politics. This categorization serves as a heuristic device, a convenient way of organizing the work on the sociocultural aspects of tuberculosis by social scientists interested in health (defined by the journal to include anthropologists, demographers, economists, educationalists, ethicists, geographers, philosophers, policy analysts, political scientists, psychologists and sociologists), as well as by health-care professionals and policy makers interested in the relevance of the social sciences to medicine (e.g., epidemiologists, health educators, physicians, public health practitioners). Since the author is trained in anthropology, the emphasis of this section focuses on anthropological work. Nevertheless, examples are provided to show that the analytic framework offered can as easily be applied to studies of tuberculosis from a wide range of disciplines. Studies placed in one category may share characteristics with those of another, but each study is classified according to its overall emphasis. It should be noted, however, that there is an increasing number of scholars (Coker, 2000; Farmer, 1997, 1999; G&y and Zumla, 2002; Jaramillo, 1999; Porter & Grange, 1999; Porter, Ogden, & Pronyk, 1999; Ogden, 2000) who suggest that all three factors should be considered in any sociocultural study of tuberculosis.  Cultural factors Studies focusing on the cultural factors associated with tuberculosis are frequently conducted by anthropologists. In the tradition of ethnomedicine, these studies classically address “those beliefs and practices relating to disease which are the products of indigenous cultural development and are not explicitly derived from the conceptual framework of modern medicine” (Hughs, 1968). Ethnomedical studies contribute to a culturally relativistic understanding of non-biomedical health practices. “Even the most exotic-appearing health beliefs and behaviors are made understandable in the cultural context in which they are found” (Rubel & Hass, 1996, p. 115). However, many medical anthropologists are not free from the ethnocentric perspectives (Good, 1994, p. 39). In many anthropological studies that investigate the cultural aspects of diseases, lay beliefs about illness are often juxtaposed with biomedical knowledge about disease. The former are viewed as culturally derived while the latter represent objective reality. The implication follows then, that correcting false beliefs with proper education would ensure compliance with biomedicine. Although medical anthropologists are increasingly critical of this empiricist assumption, the majority of recent anthropological studies of tuberculosis still interpret cultural factors with implicit empiricism (Barnhoorn & Adriaanse, 1992; Carey et al., 1997; Ito, 1999; Menegoni, 1996; Nichter, 1994; Steen & Mazonde, 1999; Vecchiato, 1997). Similar reactions to the cultural factors influencing tuberculosis illness can also be found among papers written by researchers in other disciplines (Khan et al., 2000; Liefooghe et al., 1995; Long et al., 1999; Mata, 1985; New York Task Force on Immigrant Health, 1995; Westaway, 1990). An example of this was when researchers, affiliated with academic departments of public health Long, Johansson, Diwan, and Winkvist (1999), organized focus groups in four districts of Vietnam to explore “the beliefs” of the Vietnamese people regarding tuberculosis. They concluded that traditional “erroneous beliefs in transmission routes” may delay diagnosis and increase social stigma. Similarly, a survey conducted by anthropologists Carey et al. (1997) in New York State among 51 newly arrived Vietnamese refugees highlighted the cultural factors associated with tuberculosis. The investigators stated: “Respondents correctly viewed TB as an infectious lung disease with symptoms such as cough, weakness, and weight loss…Many respondents incorrectly believed that asymptomatic latent infection is not possible” (Carey et al., 1997, p. 112, emphasis added). The study concluded that “targeted patient education is needed to address misconceptions about TB among Vietnamese refugees and to help ensure adherence to prescribed treatment regimens” (Carey et al., 1997, p. 112, emphasis added). Folk beliefs are labeled incorrect; they are thought to be “misconceptions”, whereas biomedical knowledge is described with the adjective “correct”. The unstated privileging of biomedicine and the empiricist assumption of rationalism results in the simplistic conclusion that correct behavior follows correct belief. Traditional beliefs are viewed as barriers to the delivery of biomedicine. Salvation, via biomedicine, follows a conversion from indigenous beliefs to biomedical knowledge. In addition to questioning empiricist assumptions, physician and anthropologist Paul Farmer (1997, 1999, pp. 229–261) has further criticized sociocultural studies of tuberculosis that focus on cultural factors for neglecting politico-economic forces shaping disease distribution. In his study of multi-drug-resistant TB in Haiti, Farmer found that economic factors chiefly determined compliance with treatment and argued that, in settings similar to Haiti, social scientists should not exaggerate cultural factors at the expense of more significant socioeconomic forces. Farmer eloquently reviewed and criticized studies from South Africa (de Villiers, 1991), Honduras (Mata, 1985), India (Barnhoorn & Adriaanse, 1992), and the Philippines (Nichter, 1994) to demonstrate the tendency to neglect socioeconomic constraints. Despite the limitations of the cultural approach, it should of course not be discounted. As the following example shows, there are a few studies that clearly demonstrate both the strengths and the limitations of such an approach. Vecchiato (1997) conducted, from the cultural viewpoint, a sophisticated anthropological study of tuberculosis in Ethiopia. He carefully avoided the shortcomings described above and acknowledged a range of non-cultural factors shaping the perception, the treatment, and the spread of illness. “The management of actual illness episodes is shaped not solely by culturally transmitted ethnomedical axioms, but also by practical, financial, social, structural and geographical considerations” (Vecchiato, 1997, p. 195). Having pointed out several weaknesses in the cultural approach, Vecchiato (1997, p. 196) suggested that instead of portraying traditional beliefs as a barrier to the delivery of biomedicine, the strength of the cultural approach comes from the ethnomedical concepts, such as contagiousness and dietary improvement, which can be brought to bear in shaping general health education. Similarly, Poss (1998), a health science researcher, conducted in-depth interviews with 19 Mexican migrant farmworkers regarding their perceptions of tuberculosis and found that their beliefs do not pose a barrier but are compatible with biomedical screening and treatment.   Environmental factors Let us now consider the sociocultural studies of tuberculosis that focus on environmental factors. Within the discipline of anthropology, studies investigating environmental factors have often been labeled “ecological”. The central interest of the ecological approach is the relationship between the environment and organisms within an evolutionary timeframe (Brown, Inhorn, & Smith, 1996, p. 184; McElroy, 1990, p. 244). Few anthropological studies of tuberculosis apply the ecological approach, although it is referred to in some textbooks as expanding upon the more general evolutionary point of view. For example, it is speculated that in prehistoric times, as a result of the domestication and milking of cattle, mycobacteria causing bovine tuberculosis were spread from infected cattle to those who drank the milk or ate the beef from these cattle (Roberts & Manchester, 1997, p. 136). This conclusion is drawn from an examination of skeletal change; yet it is neither specific nor conclusive, since other diseases can leave similar marks on human skeletal remains. Among studies of how human interaction with the environment changes disease patterns, some researchers have hypothesized a connection between urbanization and an increase in the incidences of tuberculosis (Diferdinando, 1999; Fenner, 1980, p. 17), and others have suggested that improved living standards and nutrition lowered mortality rates before antibiotics were available (Joske, 1980, p. 558, 561; McKeown, 1976). The strength of the ecological approach lies in its inclusion of environmental factors in illness analysis, its synthesis of biological and cultural factors in shaping sickness, and its incorporation of historical and archaeological perspectives. However, its underlying evolutionary perspective has been subject to substantial criticism by certain anthropologists. The most vocal critic of the ecological approaches in medical anthropology is Merrill Singer, who published a provocative article in Medical Anthropology Quarterly under the title, “Farewell to adaptationism: Unnatural selection and the politics of biology” (1996). In this article, Singer argues that ecological models that use adaptation as a conceptual tool are “futile” because they do not address the political economy that shapes the environment to which humans adapt. The differential survival pattern of social groups is “unnaturally selected” by conditions created to serve the interest of the dominant class. In contrast to anthropological studies of environmental factors, studies linking tuberculosis and environmental factors emerging from other disciplines usually acknowledge the importance of social forces in shaping the disease-prone environment. Six articles in Social Science & Medicine since 1990 focused on the influence of environmental factors on tuberculosis (Acevedo-Garcia, 2000; Antunes & Waldman, 2001; Bhatia, Dranyi, & Rowley, 2002; Elender et al., 1998; Klovdahl et al., 2001; Packard & Epstein, 1991). These studies not only illustrate the correlation between crowded environment and tuberculosis but also enumerate a diverse array of political and economic circumstances contributing to unhealthy environments. For instance, the Chinese occupation of Tibet and the flight of refugees resulted in crowding and a high incidence of tuberculosis in monasteries and refugee camps (Bhatia et al., 2002). Residential segregation between African-American and white populations in the United States has resulted in over-crowding and limited health care access together with tuberculosis in minority areas (Acevedo-Garcia, 2000). Historians Packard and Epstein (1991) also argue that colonial governments in Africa did not address the environmental factors that generated tuberculosis. Instead, “blacks had to be taught about the dangers of living in over-crowded housing and eating nutritionally inadequate diets, as if they chose to do so out of perversity rather than economic necessity”.   Politico-economic factors Having discussed the criticisms offered by critical medical anthropologists Farmer and Singer, critical medical anthropology requires little by way of an introduction. Clearly, the focus on politico-economic factors is evident. However, in the main body of literature reviewed in this section, most of the studies which examine politico-economic factors are not written by anthropologists (except Farmer, 1997, 1999; Farmer, Robin, Ramilus, & Kim, 1991; Rubel & Garro, 1992) but by clinicians, epidemiologists, historians and public health practitioners (Brudney & Dodkin, 1991; Dievler & Pappas, 1999; Dubos & Dubos, 1996; Kistemann et al., 2002; Naterop & Wolffers, 1999; Saunderson, 1995). All these studies share important features with works of critical medical anthropology in emphasizing the structural, political, and economic factors shaping the experience, distribution, and management of illness. Historians have long noted the high incidence of tuberculosis among disadvantaged populations (Dubos & Dubos, 1996; Lerner, 1993; Marks & Worboys, 1997; McKeown, 1976). According to the microbiologist-turned-historian Dubos and Dubos (1996, p. 207), “tuberculosis was, in effect, the first penalty that capitalistic society had to pay for the ruthless exploitation of labor”. As the living conditions of urban laborers improved in industrialized countries, the rate of tuberculosis decreased in the first half of the twentieth century. However, funding for public health tuberculosis control infrastructures was also reduced throughout the latter half of the twentieth century as a result of the considerable reduction in tuberculosis cases. Clinicians Brudney and Dodkin (1991) studied 224 patients admitted consecutively to a public hospital in New York City in 1988 and identified four social factors responsible for the resurgence of tuberculosis: the decline in tuberculosis control programs, poverty, homelessness, and alcoholism. Farmer's study (1997) of multi-drug-resistant TB in Haiti further argued that economic factors chiefly determined compliance with treatment. He claimed “the poor have no options but to be at risk for TB” and demonstrated that patients were compliant when treatment programs were made accessible, regardless of their traditional cultural explanations of tuberculosis (Farmer, 1997, p. 349). The politico-economic approach focuses our attention on the structural factors shaping tuberculosis. This may lead to a kind of structural determinism; however, since the creativity of mankind to find solutions to the problems they face is often ignored with this approach. Human beings are portrayed as helpless victims of “structural violence”. Furthermore, many studies of the politico-economic approach are biomedically centered and relate poor health to the inaccessibility of biomedicine. In addition, many critical medical anthropologists take an activist stance and are eager to convert policy makers, as well as fellow social scientists, to their point of view. McElroy (1996, p. 521) has responded to such attempt with the following statement: “Incorporating political variables into every research design because it is ideologically correct will transform anthropology into an enterprise that is over-specialized and trendy, and that moves from one fad to another”.

2250,S073288931000297X,The limitations of polymerase chain reaction in the setting of possible recurrent tuberculosis: 2 instructional cases," 2 Discussion TB diagnosis has traditionally been made on the basis of clinical presentation, radiograph findings, microscopy, and culture. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are now used widely as an additional diagnostic test. Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2009) has recommended that PCR testing is performed on at least 1 respiratory specimen from each patient for whom TB is being considered. TB PCR has greater sensitivity and specificity than microscopy but is not as sensitive as culture for the detection of pulmonary TB (Catanzaro et al., 2000; Wobeser et al., 1996). In a meta-analysis of various studies, sensitivity and specificity of TB PCR in smear-negative pulmonary disease are 66% and 98%, respectively, and in smear-positive pulmonary disease, sensitivity is 96% and specificity only 85% (Greco et al., 2006). Organism detection by PCR requires the presence of preserved genetic material, but a positive result does not necessarily indicate that the organism is viable. In patients with untreated disease, a positive PCR can generally be assumed to indicate that viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis is present. After treatment is started, PCR may remain positive in the absence of viable bacteria, as judged by conversion of cultures to negative (Yuen et al., 1993). The length of time that the PCR remains positive is not clearly defined, and the role of PCR in patients being investigated for possible TB recurrence is poorly understood. These 2 patients had both been treated for TB on 2 previous occasions. They then presented with respiratory illnesses, compatible in case 1 with acute community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and in case 2 with an upper respiratory tract infection. In both cases, the subsequent clinical courses were in keeping with these diagnoses, although no laboratory confirmation was achieved. The dilemma that arose on both occasions was how to interpret a repeatedly positive sputum TB PCR results when there was a clear discordance between this finding and the patient's clinical presentation. This dilemma was heightened in case 2, who was also sputum AFB smear positive. In both cases, the final decision was to accept that these PCR results are due to nonviable bacilli. The TB PCR used (Globan and Fyfe, 2010) is specific for the M. tuberculosis complex of organisms; however, because M. tuberculosis had been cultured during prior episodes and because no alternative species was ever cultured, it would be reasonable to assume this was the organism detected by PCR. False-positive TB PCR results are generally thought to be due to contamination within the laboratory (Greco et al., 2006; Laraque et al., 2009). It is also recognized that TB PCR can be falsely positive in patients who are on treatment (Greco et al., 2006). NAAT have an expanding role in reducing time to diagnosis and the need for respiratory isolation (Campos et al., 2008). Early correct diagnosis also allows for more directed contact tracing. NAATs are not sensitive enough to replace conventional culture-based diagnostic tests (Ling et al., 2008), and the latter are also necessary for standard drug sensitivity testing. Literature reports of sputum TB PCR remaining positive following adequately treated TB are very limited (Schluger et al., 1994). Carpentier et al. (1995) described that 1 patient was sputum TB PCR positive 2 years after diagnosis and treatment completion. The patient had no symptoms to suggest recurrence. Genotyping was not done to compare pre- and posttreatment specimens. Wobeser et al. (1996) examined 16 patients who were culture negative and PCR positive and found 2 patients PCR positive after 26 weeks of treatment and 1 noncompliant patient with HIV who was positive 130 weeks after treatment commencement. Lim et al. (2000) describe 3 patients with TB, 20, 8, and 5 years previously who were smear negative and PCR positive but culture negative.  Yuen et al. (1997) examined the role of PCR for monitoring clinical response and found 30% of patients remained positive after 6 months of treatment. This did not correlate with the clinical response but had a positive correlation with comorbidities, residual radiologic change, and relapse. Although culture is considered to be the gold standard for TB diagnosis, the possibility that the culture was falsely negative must be considered. In neither of the cases, however, was the clinical picture suggestive of ongoing active TB. Most cases that are PCR positive but culture negative are also smear negative. Occasional PCR positive cases are smear positive and culture negative but, to our knowledge, only during therapy (Vlaspolder et al., 1995; Wobeser et al., 1996; Yuen et al., 1993). Case 2 is particularly notable because smears and PCR remained positive after completion of treatment. The mechanism responsible for ongoing detection of TB DNA in the face of negative cultures is unknown. We postulate that in both patients, an unrelated bacterial or viral infection led to disruption of lung architecture and mobilization of previously encased nonviable bacilli. Notably, both of the patients had abnormal underlying lungs due to prior comorbid illness. The phenomenon of a mycobacterial PCR that remains positive even after an organism is no longer viable has been demonstrated in other disease states. Studies of Mycobacterium ulcerans suggest that DNA is persistently detected even in successfully treated lesions (Herbinger et al., 2009). In smear-positive patients, TB PCR clearly has a role when nontuberculous mycobacterial species are a significant possibility. A negative PCR allows the cessation of treatment and avoids the need for unnecessary patient isolation and tracing of contacts (Laraque et al., 2009). In smear-negative patients, physician surveys have indicated that a positive PCR would prompt treatment if this had not already been commenced, whereas a negative PCR following commencement of treatment would not lead to treatment cessation. This would suggest that if treatment has already started on the basis of a clinician's judgment as to the likelihood of TB, a PCR is of little value, because it will not change management (Conaty et al., 2005; Guerra et al., 2007). TB PCR has been shown to be highly specific in extrapulmonary TB but with poor sensitivity (Pai et al., 2003, 2004), and similarly, results did not significantly affect clinical decisions (Weiner et al., 2005). The use of reverse transcription PCR to quantify TB messenger RNA has been used as a marker of bacterial replication and is more closely correlated with progression to culture negativity. In a small study, this was a good marker of early bactericidal activity, but this was at the expense of sensitivity. One patient who had initially developed a negative result at 30 days later relapsed (Desjardin et al., 1999). In our 2 cases, a positive result may have been a useful marker of the presence of live bacilli, but a negative outcome would not have excluded pulmonary TB. In summary, TB PCR is very useful in previously untreated smear-negative patients. When the sputum smear is positive and infection with a nontuberculous mycobacterial species is considered a possibility, TB PCR has a definite role. For nonrespiratory samples, caution should be used when interpreting negative results because sensitivity is poor. The TB PCR is not of value if the level of clinical suspicion means the result will not change management. Our 2 cases illustrate that positive results should be interpreted in light of the clinical context, in patients who have commenced or been previously treated for TB. Our recommendations are summarized in Table 3 . ",0
2306,S2212553112000714,Risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in urban Pakistan: A multicenter case–control study," Patients and methods  Study setting Karachi is a major industrial and trade center of Pakistan. It has an estimated population of 9.8 million, which is largely multi-ethnic in character. Health services are provided both by public and private health care facilities in Karachi. Private sector largely consists of private practitioners, hospitals and teaching institutions, while the public sector is comprised of government hospitals and dispensaries. For this study, cases and controls were enrolled from three tertiary care health facilities of Karachi, namely, Aga Khan University Hospital, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, and Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases.   Definitions and selection of cases and controls In this study, a case was considered a patient of either gender, aged 15years old or older, diagnosed with culture-confirmed MDR-TB and M. tuberculosis strain resistant to at least INH and RMP (two first-line anti-TB dugs) [1,13,14]. The control was a patient of either gender, aged 15years old or order, diagnosed with culture-confirmed non-MDR-TB and M. tuberculosis strain sensitive to first-line (INH, RMP, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin) anti-TB drugs [15]. Between January 1, 2000, and February 28, 2002, eligible cases and controls were identified through the records or in-patients of the three tertiary-care hospitals and were invited to participate in the study. Cases and controls unable to provide an interview owing to problems with speech, hearing or very poor general state of health were excluded.   Data collection A structured and pre-tested questionnaire was administered to both cases and controls. The questionnaire comprised questions on socio-demographic characteristics, BCG vaccination, and history of prior TB treatment. It also included questions on the presence of any TB patients in the family or other possible sources of contact with TB patient(s), current therapy for TB if any, and compliance with past and present TB therapy. Two data collectors (one male and one female) and the principal author constituted the data collection team. Both the data collectors were fluent in Urdu and Sindhi – the two main locally spoken dialects – had over 12years of formal schooling, and had previous experience in carrying out questionnaire-based interviews. Postal addresses and, where available, telephone numbers were obtained from medical records. Subjects were contacted at given addresses, and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Eligible subjects available during data collection period as in-patients were interviewed in the respective wards of the three hospitals.   Data analysis Data were managed using EPI-INFO version 6.04 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) and analyzed using SPSS version 10 (Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were computed for independent variables and compared between cases and controls using ? 2 test or Student’s t-test as appropriate. Unadjusted association of each independent variable with the outcome variable (case/control status) was evaluated using univariable logistic regression analyses. Variables significantly (P <0.25) associated with the outcome were considered for inclusion in a multivariable logistic regression model [16]. Adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) and unadjusted OR for history of prior TB treatment (primary exposure of interest) were compared in the presence and absence of other variables respectively. If there was an absolute difference of 10% or more in ORadj and unadjusted OR for history of prior TB treatment in the presence and absence of a given variable, it was retained in the multivariable logistic regression model. After developing a main effect model, biologically meaningful interaction terms were assessed for their statistical significance. The final model was evaluated by the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [16]. An informed consent was always requested from eligible subjects, and those consenting to participate in the study were interviewed. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review committee.  ",0
2314,S1472979214203969,"Prediction of XDR/pre-XDR tuberculosis by genetic mutations among MDR cases from a hospital in Shandong, China"," 2 Methods  2.1 Clinical strains Shandong province is located in the east coast of China, and it is the second largest province, with a population of 96 million. TB patients in Shandong province are usually diagnosed and treated in county TB dispensary (CTD), which is the authorized primary institution for TB diagnosis, treatment and case management. The prevalence of MDR, pre-XDR and XDR TB was 3.6%, 2.6% and 0.7%, respectively, according to a population-based survey during 2007 and 2009 [22]. SPCH is the only provincial-level hospital specializing in TB clinical service and control in Shandong province. SPCH is located in Jinan, which is the capital of Shandong province and has 10 CTDs. Most TB cases in Jinan were diagnosed and treated in local CTDs. Patients who went to SPCH were mainly relapse cases. About 60% of the patients in SPCH were from Jinan, and the remaining 40% were from other areas of Shandong Province. The prevalence of MDR and XDR in SPCH was 10.8% and 2.0%, respectively, during 2004–2007 [9]. During January 2008–July 2012, a total of 3318 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates were cultured in SPCH. A number of 276 isolates were identified as MDR by drug susceptibility test (DST) of first-line drugs using Löwenstein–Jensen (L–J) proportion method [7]. Excluding the isolates that repeatedly collected from the same case, a total of 215 MDR strains with one strain from each patient were included for the study.   2.2 Drug susceptibility tests of second-line drugs DSTs of second-line drugs were applied to all 215 MDR isolates in the tuberculosis reference laboratory (TRL) in SPCH. The DST was performed by the L–J proportion method, with the following critical concentrations: levofloxacin (LEV), 2.0 ?g/ml, amikacin (AMK), 30.0 ?g/ml, capreomycin, 40.0 ?g/ml. The reference strain, H37Rv that susceptible to all drugs, was used as control. External quality assurance on drug susceptibility testing by proficiency testing was conducted regularly (twice every year) by the national reference laboratory of China and the supranational reference laboratory (SRL) of the Public Health Laboratory, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. Briefly, the TRL received a panel of 30 strains, including 10 unique strain and 10 pairs of duplicate strains to test their susceptibility to both first-line (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Streptomycin and Ethambutol) and second-line drugs (Amikacin, Kanamycin, Capromycin, Ofloxacin). An efficiency (ratio of the number of correct results and the total number of results) of 90%, a reproducibility (intra laboratory agreement between duplicate strains) of 70%, a sensitivity (ability to detect true resistance) of 75%, and a specificity (ability to detect true susceptibility) of 75% were set as the eligibility standard.   2.3 DNA extraction and sequencing Genomic DNAs of the 215 MDR isolates were extracted using a rapid boiling method [23]. For all isolates, a 423-bp fragment (containing the QRDR) of gyrA, a 516-bp fragment of rrs and the complete open reading frame of tlyA were amplified and sequenced with primers described in a previous study (Supplementary Table 1) [24]. Sequence data was assembled and analyzed by DNASTAR Lasergene 8.0. Repeat DST was performed on isolates for which the genotypic result predicted resistance, but it was determined to be susceptible by the initial DST.   2.4 Genotyping Typing of 16 loci variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) (VNTR-16) was performed on all isolates following the protocol described by Zhang et al. [25]. Two or more strains with the same VNTR genotype were defined as a cluster. We used the deletion-targeted multiplex PCR (DTM-PCR) to identify the Beijing genotype strains. [26]    2.5 Statistical analysis We determined the number and frequency of each resistance-conferring mutation among the clinical isolates in our sample. We estimated the sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) for using genetic mutations to predict corresponding phenotypic resistance.

2325,S000992600300120X,Isolated Solitary Vertebral Body Tuberculosis—Study of Seven Cases," 2 Materials and Methods A retrospective study of seven patients (four men, three woman; age range: 18–60 years; mean 33 years) with isolated tuberculous involvement of single vertebral body was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these patients was performed between June 1993 and May 2002. Only those cases where pathological proof of tuberculosis was available, either by histopathological or culture and microbiological studies or response to anti-tuberculous therapy, were included. Cases where there was involvement of the parts of the vertebrae other than the body (e.g. posterior elements) were excluded from this study. Cases with intervertebral disc involvement were also excluded. Imaging studies consisted of plain radiography and MRI in each case. MRI was undertaken using 0.5T (MR Max GE) and 1.5T (Echospeed, G.E.) MR scanners, using spinal surface coils. Spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted (T1W) [repetition/echo time (TR/TE)=400–700/10–35], SE T2-weighted (T2W) (TR/TE=2000–4000/70–110) and gradient echo (GE) T2W (TR/TE/flip angle=300–700/10–40/10°–40°) were obtained in axial, sagittal and coronal planes, with 2–7 mm slice thickness, 256×128–256 matrix with field of view of about 24–28 cm. Contrast-enhanced studies were not performed in any of the cases. In three patients, fat-suppressed T2W images were also obtained. The images were evaluated with regard to the specific level of involvement, marrow changes, destructive bone changes, soft tissue changes, adjacent disc changes, exact location with respect to dural spaces, mass effect on the adjacent structures and the changes related to the spinal cord. Marrow changes were noted, which were seen as signal intensity (SI) changes, appearing hyperintense (Fig. 1a ) on T2 and hypointense (Fig. 1b ) on T1W images, compared with the adjacent fatty marrow. Clinical information regarding symptoms, signs, examination findings, and any other site of involvement with tuberculosis, laboratory investigations, histopathology and response to treatment were obtained in all cases. Computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy was performed in five patients, to confirm the diagnosis. ",0
2328,S016558761200122X,Atypical presentation of laryngeal tuberculosis in a pediatric patient," 2 Case report A 15-year-old girl presented hoarseness that had developed over the course of a week and remained stable thereafter for about 8 months. The patient denied dysphagia, odynophagia, cough, hemoptysis, fever, chills, sick contacts, night sweats or weight loss. There was no recent travel history and she was born and raised in New York City. She reported a history of a positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) when she was young, with a course of medical treatment. Past medical history was significant only for asthma. The patient's voice was noted to be weak and breathy without stridor. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Notably, the chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no cervical lymphadenopathy. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy performed in the office showed non-specific findings of fullness of the bilateral false vocal cords along with mucosal irregularities (Fig. 1 ). The patient was brought to the operating room, where direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, rigid bronchoscopy and rigid esophagoscopy were performed. Findings on intraoperative examination included a friable right cricoarytenoid complex and false vocal cord with ecchymotic changes. Both vocal cords featured friable fullness in the posterior aspects as well (Fig. 2 ). There were no subglottic lesions and esophagoscopy was unremarkable. Biopsies were taken and pathology of the tissue revealed extensive necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Histopathologic evaluation was positive for acid-fast bacilli. Following the diagnosis of LTB, hospital infection control was notified, the patient was admitted an isolation unit and an anti-tuberculin regimen was initiated. Chest radiography revealed cavitary lesions in the apices of both lung fields. ",0
2345,S120197121300218X,Risk factors for multidrug resistance among previously treated patients with tuberculosis in eastern China: a case–control study," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study population and design A case–control study was carried out from July through August 2011 in five cities (Hangzhou, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Quzhou, and Lishui) that conducted drug resistance surveillance in Zhejiang Province. In Zhejiang, all sputum smear-positive patients detected in a specialized TB hospital in the county were referred to a municipal specialized TB hospital, where further diagnosis was made by sputum culture. The sputum specimens of sputum culture-positive patients were the sent to the Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (TRL) at the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, where drug susceptibility testing (DST) and bacterium identification tests were performed. After that, the diagnosis results were fed back to the municipal specialized TB hospital to confirm whether the patients had MDR-TB or not. In this study, the medical records of all TB patients in the municipal specialized TB hospital were checked, after which the patients who met the inclusion criteria were contacted consecutively for informed consent. The inclusion criteria for the cases were as follows: (1) M. tuberculosis detected in the patient's bacterium identification test; (2) strains resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin by DST, which was routinely performed on isolates of M. tuberculosis by the proportion method (minimum inhibitory concentration: isoniazid 0.2?g/ml, rifampin 40?g/ml, streptomycin 4?g/ml, ethambutol 2?g/ml, kanamycin 30?g/ml, ofloxacin 2?g/ml); (3) a history of treatment with anti-TB drugs for more than 1 month, 19  i.e., treatment classification in the medical records was ‘previously treated’, including relapses, treatment after failure, treatment after default, and chronic patients; 3  (4) patient was registered between March 1, 2010 and August 31, 2011; (5) willing to participate in the study; and (6) complete medical records available. The inclusion criteria for the controls were the same as those for the cases, except that the strains were sensitive to both isoniazid and rifampin by DST. The exclusion criterion for cases and controls was: the patient could not provide correct information, such as TB patients with mental illness or alcohol abuse patients.   2.2 Data collection A structured questionnaire was used to collect information. A pilot test was carried out to determine any inappropriate content or logic errors in the questionnaire, and necessary modifications were made. After obtaining informed consent, a face-to-face interview was conducted among recruited patients to collect information on demographic characteristics and risk factors, including gender, age, ethnicity, occupation, education, social and economic factors, work environment, history of previous treatment, adverse effects of anti-TB medication, and knowledge of TB. Other information such as height, weight, clinical diagnosis, and DST results were obtained directly from the medical records. Investigators were trained before interview to reduce the investigation bias.   2.3 Statistical analysis All data were double-entered into EpiData 3.1 (Denmark) and discrepancies were checked against the raw data. The data analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). In the univariate analysis, the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, as well as the Student's t-test (two-sided), were performed to identify risk factors for MDR-TB, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In order to control for confounding factors such as gender and age, a multivariate analysis was performed by forward stepwise (likelihood ratio) multiple logistic regression. In the forward stepwise regression, independent variables with a p-value less than 0.10 were included in the logistic model, while variables with a p-value more than 0.15 were removed. Multicollinearity among independent variables was explored using collinearity diagnostics and was expressed as the variance inflation factor (VIF), condition index, and variance proportions. VIF and condition index ?10 were considered as obviously collinear. Variables included in the final model were chosen based on the univariate analysis (p <0.10) as well as biological plausibility. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate the magnitude of association between risk factors and MDR-TB.  ",0

2373,S1755001709001122,Unusual case of unilateral whiteout on chest radiograph with evidence of previous pulmonary tuberculosis exposure," 2 Discussions These features are suggestive of unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a part of the spectrum of congenital anomalies of lung whereby there is poor development of lung tissue. There are various types of under development. They are agenesis (complete absence of lung tissue), aplasia (a rudimentary bronchus without lung tissue) and hypoplasia (variable reduction of lung tissue). 1  Aetiology of this condition remains unclear, however, factors affecting the lung growth such as reduced thoracic space available for lung development and decreased pulmonary vascular perfusion have been implicated. 2  It is associated with number of other congenital abnormalities and vascular defects. 3  The degree of severity depends on the type of abnormality present. Presentation is usually during neonatal or early childhood period. Asymptomatic adult presentation is rare. On the plain chest radiograph it appears as whiteout, the differentials may include unilateral effusion, consolidation and segmental or lobar collapse. Although CT thorax may help to aid the diagnosis, angiography, DSA (Digital subtraction angiography) or MR angiogram may be indicated for vascular assessment. 4,5   Clinical presentation and prognosis depend on the extent of pulmonary and vascular anomalies present, in-addition to the degree of secondary complications such as pulmonary hypertension or bronchiectasis. In adult pulmonary hypoplasia the symptoms are likely to be due to the development of bronchiectasis and hence the treatment consists of preventing recurrent infections and maintaining bronchial hygiene with physiotherapy, bronchodilators, antibiotics and mucolytics. This lady had evidence of possible exposure to pulmonary tuberculosis with right upper lobe fibrotic changes, calcifications and a small cavity. This cavity is occupied centrally and likely to be an aspergilloma. As she was asymptomatic, she was reassured and was advised in-regards to bronchial hygiene. This case illustrates an unusual cause for unilateral whiteout on a chest radiograph in adults with complications from secondary infections. Pre-existing cavities (possibly old TB in this case) is the most common cause of aspergilloma. Features of unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia, old tuberculosis and aspergilloma were seen together in this interesting rare case. ",0

Seriously ill patients who were unable to undergo an interview, patients who refused to provide consent, patients under the age of 18 years, pregnant women, and patients with a concurrent major psychiatric illness were excluded from the study. A total of 146 patients from the 7 aforementioned districts were registered from February to December 2010. Of these 146 patients, one patient refused to give consent, and 3 patients moved and their treatment details were not available. Information about the deceased patients was obtained from their relatives; a few of the patients who were critically ill at the time of interview were approached after their health improved and interviews were obtained. Therefore, complete data were available for 142 patients. All the patients were followed for 24 months to determine the final outcome. Pre-treatment investigations included complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, sputum for acid fast bacilli (AFB), culture and DST, chest X-ray, urine analysis for albumin, sugar and bile pigment, pregnancy test in female patients of reproductive age and ELISA for HIV antibodies. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin [4].  Category IV treatment regimen in RNTCP The Standardize Treatment Regimen (Cat IV) of RNTCP was used for the treatment of MDR-TB cases (and those with rifampicin resistance) under the program. The Cat IV regimen comprises 6 drugs – kanamycin, ofloxacin (levofloxacin), ethionamide, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and cycloserine – for 6–9 months of the intensive phase and 4 drugs – ofloxacin (levofloxacin), ethionamide, ethambutol and cycloserine – during for the 18 months of the continuation Phase. p-Aminosalicylic acid is included in the regimen as a substitute drug if any bactericidal drug (K, Ofl, Z and Eto) or 2 bacteriostatic (E and Cs) drugs are not tolerated [10].   Ethical considerations The study was conducted after obtaining approval from Institutional Review Board, Medical College, Baroda. All patients were enrolled in the study after providing written and informed consent in the local language. Privacy was ensured while the patients were interviewed. The District Tuberculosis Officers (DTO) of the aforementioned 7 districts were informed about this study and their cooperation was solicited. All 142 patients were interviewed by using pretested semi-structured questionnaire at the DOTS Centre of the respective districts when they came to receive treatment (if they were still undergoing extended treatment), or patients or their relatives were interviewed at their homes (in cases of defaulters/death). Each interview took approximately 15–20min and the local language of the area was preferred. The patients were asked questions related to their treatment compliance and various adverse drug reactions (ADRs) experienced with the present treatment, and relevant findings and responses were recorded during the interview. The enrolled patients were also asked regarding their time of acquisition of TB, and their type of default in previous treatment was noted on their DOTS Plus cards. The patient cards at DOTS Plus site were used to extract the required details: sputum culture reports, details of changes in treatment in patients with ADRs, and drug compliance. Six monthly treatment outcomes on the basis of sputum and culture reports, the 12-month treatment outcome, the final outcome at the end of 24 months (as per DOTS Plus RNTCP guidelines), various ADRs, and the relevant findings of patients were also assessed based on the records and were verified by personal interview. The patients’ compliance was checked based on the notes in their respective cards. Data triangulation was performed by asking the DOTS Plus supervisor and the patient or his/her relatives questions on their regularity in adhering to treatment. The forms were checked for errors and corrected on the same day of data collection. The data were entered into an Excel 2007 worksheet, and data entry was performed using strict check files in Microsoft Excel. Data were cleaned, checked for discrepancies and rectified. Data analysis was performed with Epi Info 7.0.8.0.   Operational definitions MDR – TB, cure, treatment completed, death, treatment failure, and treatment default were defined as per RNTCP guidelines [11].  Successful outcome: Cure and completion of treatment were considered to represent successful outcome [11].  Non-successful outcome: Defaults, death, switched to category V treatment, failure and still on treatment were considered to represent non-successful outcomes [11].  ",0
2440,S1344622302001402,An autopsy case of miliary tuberculosis in a young adult," 2 Case A 23 year-old woman was found dead in her house by her father. She worked as a hostess at a nightclub but had been jobless for a year before her death. From about 20 days before death, she confined herself at home and was sleeping most of the time. At the external examination, the cause of death could not be diagnosed due to a lack of medical history. An administrative autopsy was performed about 20h postmortem.  2.1 External and autopsy findings The female body was slightly pale, 162cm in length and 44kg in weight. Bilateral pleural adhesions and many tuberculous nodules were found diffusely in bilateral lungs. Similar white nodules were seen on the surface of the liver (Fig. 1 ). The structure of the small intestinal mucosal surface was destroyed (Fig. 2 ). Light yellow ascites of 500ml was present. The heart weighed 359g. Many white ‘polyps’were seen on the endocardium of the right auricle (Fig. 3a ).   2.2 Microscopic findings Many foci of caseous necrosis with Langhans' giant cells were seen in the lungs and small intestine. Tubercle bacilli were demonstrated in the lungs and the small intestine by Ziehl–Neelsen staining (Figs. 4 and 5  ). The white ‘polyps’ in the right auricle were found to be old thrombi (Fig. 3b).   2.3 Immunological finding No immunological evidence for HIV infection was found.  ",0
2455,S0749379703003246,Social determinants of tuberculosis case rates in the United States," Methods State-level correlational analyses were utilized. Tuberculosis case rates per 100,000 population (by state) for 1999 were obtained from federal surveillance documents (compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).21 The measure of social capital was obtained from Putnam's public use data set (available at www.bowlingalone.com).22 Putnam's data set is a comprehensive snapshot of social capital at the state level in the 1990s. The data set includes 14 variables that span the domains of community organizational life (e.g., the number of nonprofit organizations per capita in a state); involvement in public affairs (e.g., percentage of persons in a state serving on a committee for a local organization); volunteerism (e.g., average number of times persons in a state report volunteering); informal sociability (e.g., self-reported time spent visiting friends); and social trust (e.g., self-reported beliefs about whether people are honest).2,22 Putnam has combined these 14 variables into one state-level, social capital index; we used this “comprehensive social capital index” as a predictor variable in the present research.2,22  The poverty measure, obtained from federal publications,23,24 is expressed as the percentage of each state's population living in poverty in the 1997–1998 period. Income inequality was measured (by state) as the ratio of mean income for the top-earning one fifth of households to the bottom one fifth. This ratio was calculated by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities/Economic Policy Institute using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 1996–1998 Current Population Survey.25 Values for all variables were available for the 48 contiguous states. The bivariate relationship between each predictor variable and tuberculosis case rates was assessed by calculating linear correlation coefficients with a type-I error rate (alpha) of 0.01. If more than one significant bivariate predictor was identified, then forward stepwise linear multiple regression was performed (using all bivariate-significant predictors as candidates to enter the multiple regression equation). A candidate predictor variable could enter and remain in the multivariate equation if the p value associated with its multivariate regression coefficient was ?0.05. Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2000 and SAS 8.2. ",0

Previously independent of all activities of daily living, she started requiring increased assistance. Workup revealed diffuse intraperitoneal lymphadenopathy, a pancreatic mass, bilateral lung nodules, and a CT-guided pancreatic lymph node biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas. Electromyography (EMG) was negative for acute findings. Brain imaging was negative for acute intracranial process. Quadriparesis was thought possibly secondary to Sarcoidosis-related myopathy and after treatment with steroids, she was transferred to acute inpatient rehabilitation for functional upgrading. Prior bronchoalveolar lavage studies returned positive for Acid-Fast Bacilli and she returned back to the acute care hospital to treat disseminated Tuberculosis (TB). She remained extremely ataxic with quadriparesis and areflexia, had significant proprioception loss, and poor appetite. ",0

A salutary case of diagnostic delay in a pilgrim returning from Mecca," 2 Case report A 59- year-old woman, born in Israel of Arab Bedouin origin, was admitted with dry cough and fever for 2 days after returning from a month's pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. She arrived in Mecca 1 month earlier feeling unwell and was examined in an emergency room, but she was released 3 h later without having received any treatment. Afterwards, she felt well for 4 weeks until she arrived back in Israel, where she experienced fever and dry cough. On admission, her blood pressure was 113/67, pulse 100, fever 38.7 °C, and respiration 14 breaths/min with saturation of 94% room air. There were rales at the left lung base. The rest of the physical examination was normal. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest X-ray showed a pattern of diffuse lung disease and a new infiltrate in the left lower lobe (Fig. 1 ). There were bilateral upper lobe cystic lesions with thin borders without an infiltrate or air-fluid level, and without change since 1994. Laboratory results revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 120, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dl, hematocrit 43.1%, WBC 20.490/?l, neutrophils 89.9%, and platelets 301,000. Glucose, electrolytes, and renal and liver functions were normal. LDH was 503 U/L, albumin 2.9 g/dl, pH 7.43, paCO2 36.7 mmHg, paO2 57.6 mmHg, HCO3 23.9 meq/L, and O2 saturation 91.6%. On admission, the clinical impression was of CAP, and the patient was started on cefuroxime and ofloxacin 400 mg×2 and oxygen. The patient continued to suffer from fever reaching 39 °C. A sputum sample on the 5th day of admission was negative on Ziehl Neelsen stain. After 8 days of treatment, and with initial blood and urine cultures having returned sterile, the antibiotics were stopped. Sputum cultures during the window period revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa; sputum, gastric juice, and urine samples for Ziehl Neelsen stains were negative for acid-fast bacilli. The patient was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam. However, 7 days of therapy caused no change in her cough or fever, which reached 39–40 °C every day. HIV was negative. Computerized tomography of the chest (on day 14) showed a new infiltrate in the left upper lobe that looked like an infected cyst with diffuse honeycombing bilaterally. 4 days later, bronchoscopy was normal and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 1250 cells/?l with 97% polymorphs and 3% monoclonal cell. A transbronchial biopsy showed acute and chronic inflammation without evidence of granulomatous inflammation. The patient also underwent a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, which were normal. The pulmonologist recommended a trial of anti-tuberculosis therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for suspected smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis. On this regimen, the fever and cough resolved and led to discharge on hospital day 29, to be followed by directly observed therapy. On day 32 after admission, and 3 days after her discharge, the sputum culture taken on the 5th day revealed acid-fast bacilli in the MGIT culture, later identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Over the next 2 weeks, positive cultures were returned from another sputum sample, gastric juice, and BAL fluid. The patient's M. tuberculosis was sensitive to all five first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. ",0

Extrapulmonary TB also occurs frequently and is reported to be between 16% and 30 % [1,3,5]; however, the diagnosis of the disease is difficult and often delayed due to its atypical presentation. Furthermore, management of TB is challenging because of the side effects of anti-TB agents and their potential interactions with immunosuppressive therapies resulting in inadequate immunosuppressive levels that may lead to graft rejection [2,3]. The following is a case report of a renal transplant recipient who had an atypical presentation of Myobacterium tuberculosis and the difficulties encountered with the management of her disease.",0
2533,S2213007112000366,Broncho pleuro subcutaneous fistula with subcutaneous emphysema: A rare presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis," 2 Case report A 46-year-old male who worked in a factory presented with complaints of breathlessness, with swelling over the chest for past two days. This was sudden in onset after a bout of coughing leading to an initial swelling at the left side of the chest and then spreading to whole chest, neck, arm and face over the next few hours. There was history of low-grade fever and cough with expectoration for the past one year. There was history of antitubercular treatment 6 months back for one month which the patient had left due to financial reasons. He denied any history of trauma to chest, lifting of heavy weight, vomiting or retching. There was no history of chest pain or any hospitalization or any medical or surgical procedure in the recent past. There was no previous history of shortness of breath. There was no history of smoking, alcoholism or any other addiction. Bowel and bladder were regular and sleep was decreased. On examination, there was swelling over neck, chest, abdomen, scrotum and both upper limbs. Vital parameters revealed pulse rate 90/min, blood pressure 116/78 mm Hg, respiratory rate 24/min with respiratory distress. The skin over the third intercostal space on the left side showed an expansile impulse on coughing. There was no evidence of mediastinal shift or cardiac tamponade clinically, and neck veins were normal. On palpation there was no tenderness. Characteristic Rice Kris pies sensations were present over the swollen area. Crepts were heard on auscultation. Classical cavernous type of breathing was present in left infraclavicular area. The patient was put on high flow oxygen and bronchodilators. Multiple subcutaneous incisions were given at the level of thoracic inlet. Subcutaneous emphysema initially reduced, but only to recur after several bout of coughing. Other body system examinations were unremarkable. Investigations revealed hemoglobin 8.6 gm%; total leukocyte count 7400 cells/mm3 (polymorphs 80%, lymphocytes 20 %,). Sputum smear was 2+ for acid-fast bacilli. Skiagram chest PA view disclosed extensive subcutaneous emphysema, bilateral upper zone cavity, along with emphysematous changes. There was no evidence of pneumothorax, or gas under diaphragm. Ultrasound of abdomen was reported to be normal (Fig. 1 ). CECT of the chest showed subcutaneous emphysema with pneumomediastinum with multiple variable sized cavity formation in bilateral upper and right middle lobe with a rent in the lateral aspect of the largest cavity in left upper lobe communicating to the subcutaneous tissue resulting in a cavernous–pleuro–soft tissue fistula. The cause was attributed to the high tension inside the cavity. Manual reduction of emphysema was done by multiple subcutaneous incisions at the level of thoracic inlet. The patient was put on anti-tuberculosis drugs in combination along with broad spectrum antibiotics, bronchodilators and oxygen. Subcutaneous emphysema resolved in twenty days and the patient was discharged on the twentieth day on anti-tuberculosis drugs and supportive therapy (Fig. 2 ). ",0

2574,S1079210408001157,"Primary oral tuberculosis: a case series from Bucharest, Romania","In most of the European Union (EU) and Western Europe, TB notification rates are lower than 20 cases per 100,000 individuals, 6  and these cases are generally limited to specific populations, primarily urban and immigrant communities. This difference in TB case frequencies has led to the diversification of Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination policies throughout Europe (Table I). In many countries, BCG vaccination has been discontinued or limited to at-risk children such as those born in or originating from countries with high prevalence or those who have a family history of TB. Furthermore, BCG revaccination has been gradually abandoned. For example, the United Kingdom reported a notification rate of 12.3 × 105 in 2003; based on this information, vaccination is recommended for all children before starting school. In Italy, with a notification rate of 7.9 × 105 in 2003, vaccination has been limited to at-risk children.

2595,S0166361514001808,Semantic interoperability of controlled vocabularies in medicine: A case study of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases ‘Tuberculosis’ subset," 2 Material and methods The MLHIM specifications are the XML-based implementation of the multilevel modelling principles. MLHIM defines a common, generic information model, known as the Reference Model (RM). XML Schema 1.1 was chosen as the language for the reference implementation of the MLHIM RN. The MLHIM Domain Models comprise healthcare, administrative and demographic concepts, required for the complete and accurate record of medical documentation. They are formalized in XML Schema Definition files that further constraint the RM schema, known as Concept Constraint Definitions (CCDs). CCDs are regarded as the data model artefacts for the MLHIM specifications. Since CCDs are constraints of the generic RM, they are fully transportable across all MLHIM based applications. So any instance data created according to a CCD will always be interpreted correctly [17]. The CCDs and all their components are labelled by Type 4 Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) so that no collision can ever occur between a given data instance and its correspondent CCD. Each individual CCD is a formal and semantically coherent definition for a healthcare concept at any point in time, as determined by the modeller. This creates an ecosystem where the data models defined by CCDs never need to change; preventing semantic inconsistencies caused by data migration as seen in other approaches. Any time that there is a change in the medical science that affects a given concept already defined by a CCD, a new CCD should be modelled, but data instances created in the past will preserve the semantics associated to the data as it was conceived at that specific point in history. This is an essential feature of medical knowledge representation in controlled vocabularies, since they are versioned, and each controlled vocabulary has a different versioning method [20]. Two anonymized public databases managed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Mortality Information System (MIS) and the Hospital Information System (HIS) were selected for the development of the use case presented in this study, since both adopt ICD-10 for diagnostic records. The latest year of available mortality data was 2012, so this year was used to migrate the original data models to the MLHIM specifications. The CCDs for “Brazilian Death Certificate” and “Brazilian Public Hospital Discharge Summary” were modelled by the use of the Concept Constraint Definition Generator (CCD-Gen) (www.ccdgen.com), a web-based MLHIM CCD editor. Each variable of both systems were modelled as a Pluggable complexType (PcT). A PcT is the fragment of XML Schema that represents each specific data component of a given medical concept. According to the MLHIM specifications, the ‘dv’ element of a PcT has to be restricted to one of the defined data types; for the representation of terms from a controlled vocabulary, the DvCodedStringType is the proper choice. DvCodedStringType is constructed of required and optional elements. The required elements define name of the data component; the source vocabulary name, abbreviation and version; and the list of codes and strings (data values) that compose a given term subset (Table 1 ). For MIS, ICD-10 was defined as the reference terminology for the PcTs ‘Cause of Death: Line A’, ‘Cause of Death: Line B’, ‘Cause of Death: Line C’, ‘Cause of Death: Line D’, ‘Cause of Death: Line II (a)’, ‘Cause of Death: Line II (b)’, ‘Underlying Cause of Death (Pre-Investigation)’ and ‘Underlying Cause of Death (Post-Investigation)’. For HIS, the same procedure was adopted for the PcTs ‘Primary Diagnosis’ and ‘Secondary Diagnosis’. For demonstration purposes, the sample CCD instances produced by each CCD were used as a model to convert the original MIS and HIS databases to a MLHIM type of XML instance, persisted in an eXist-DB XML database. The ICD-10 ‘Tuberculosis’ diagnostic group was chosen for implementation of the sample instances, since it is a well-defined, complete ICD-10 term subset, widely used in morbidity and mortality information systems. The selected ICD-10 terminology subset was imported into the CCD-Gen as a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file as entries to its internal vocabulary management system. The English version of the ICD-10 code database, available at the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification Downloads Area (http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/), was the source of data. From this database, a CSV file was generated, containing the required codes and code strings of the ‘Tuberculosis’ diagnostic group. Two XML parsers and validators, Xerces and SaxonEE, via the oXygen version 14.2 editor, were used to execute the proof of validation chain of the simulated data instances: from the XML data instances to the CCD and from the CCD to the MLHIM RM Schema. Finally, the MLHIM RM Schema was validated against the W3C XML Schema 1.1 specifications. ",0
2605,S1871404809000252,Primary oropharyngeal tuberculosis causing destruction of uvula—A rare presentation," 2 Case report A 7-year-old female patient presented to the Otolaryngology outpatient department with the chief complaint of cough for one and half years, especially at night. She also complained of pain during deglutition (odynophagia) for the same period. There was associated loss of appetite. She also suffered from nasal regurgitation of food for the last 6 months. Examination of the oropharynx revealed pooling of saliva and congestion of gums. There was erosion of uvula and posterior soft palate. There was also an ulcerated area on adjacent area of left tonsillar fossa with slough over posterior pharyngeal wall (Photo 1 ). There were also multiple bilateral matted cervical lymph nodes in levels 1b, 2, 3, 4. On indirect laryngoscopy, larynx was normal. Examination of nose on anterior rhinoscopy showed no abnormality. General examination revealed that the patient weighed 12kg and was mildly anemic. Laboratory findings revealed Hb-8 gm%; TLC 10,000, N 48, L46, M 2, E 4, B 0; ESR 100mm/h in first hour. Chest skiagram was normal. Patient was started on a course of antibiotics (amoxycillin–clauvulanate in appropriate dosage), initially for 7 days. This was later continued for another 7 days. However, as there was no significant improvement, biopsy was taken from the posterior soft palate region because of suspicion of malignancy. Histopathological examination showed epithelioid cell granuloma with Langhan's and foreign body type giant cells indicating tubercular inflammation. Subsequently Tuberculin test showed induration of 22mm. The patient was started on Category 3 Anti tubercular drugs (2HRZE+4HR) after which the patient improved significantly with gradual resolution of the ulcers. ",0
2628,S1473309910701419,"Diagnostic approaches for paediatric tuberculosis by use of different specimen types, culture methods, and PCR: a prospective case-control study"," Methods  Cases and controls The study design is summarised in figure 1 . This study included cases with clinical evidence suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy controls matched for age and sex. Children with evidence of HIV infection or AIDS were excluded. Cases were enrolled between April, 2002, and January, 2007, at the Instituto de Salud del Niño and the Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru. Paediatricians assessing children with respiratory illness in clinics at the two participating hospitals referred patients that they suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis to a physician co-investigator or study nurse, who then assessed their eligibility for participation. Cases were classified according to the clinical criteria of Stegen and colleagues 16  (ie, Jones score in Africa) for diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis as revised by Toledo and colleagues, 17  with modifications. This Stegen-Toledo scoring system is widely used throughout Latin America, and criteria used to determine Stegen-Toledo score are shown in table 1 . Inclusion criteria for cases were age 12 years or younger, Stegen-Toledo score of 5 points or more, and absence of antituberculosis therapy. Although positive M tuberculosis culture is one of the Stegen-Toledo criteria, culture results were a primary outcome of this study and were not available at enrolment; therefore, this criterion was not included in our modified scoring system for participant eligibility. Cases were classified as either at moderate risk (Stegen-Toledo score 5–6 points) or high risk (score ?7 points) for tuberculosis. Empiric treatment for tuberculosis was given according to standard guidelines of WHO and the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Therapeutic decisions including inpatient versus outpatient management and treatment protocols used were established by local hospital physicians. The study procedures did not necessitate admission to hospital. Age-matched and sex-matched controls were enrolled on a continuing basis from the Pampas de San Juan, a low-income shanty town community in south Lima that is within the area served by one of the hospitals from which cases were recruited. Inclusion criteria were an absence of chronic cough, fever, or evidence of pulmonary disease; absence of previous clinical tuberculosis; no previous or current treatment for tuberculosis; and absence of recent (past 2 months) household contacts with known or suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Cases and controls were screened for HIV infection by duplicate commercial assays. HIV DNA PCR tests were done in children younger than 18 months old. Screening for HIV infection was requested, but not required if parents refused the test. Cases and controls who declined HIV testing were included and classified as HIV negative if they had no history of HIV exposure and no clinical evidence of HIV/AIDS. Written informed consent was obtained from all cases and controls or their parents or guardians. This research adhered to human experimentation guidelines of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The protocol and consent forms were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Tulane Medical Centre, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Asociación Benéfica PRISMA, the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (Lima, Peru), Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia, and the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño (Lima, Peru).   Data collection Demographic and clinical data, including tuberculin skin test results, were obtained from cases and controls. Data collected from cases consisted of medical history, physical examination findings, and a chest radiograph read by a paediatric radiologist. Specimens obtained from cases for tuberculosis cultures and PCR were gastric aspirates, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and stool samples. Gastric aspirates were obtained on two successive early mornings (0600–0700 h) by brief (<10 min) nasogastric intubation after an overnight fast. The volume of gastric aspirates was augmented as needed by injecting 5 mL sterile water and aspirating back. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained daily for 2 days by inserting a soft flexible nasopharyngeal tube into the nasopharynx, lavaging with 5 mL saline solution, and aspirating with an electrical suction device or hand-held aspirator. The nasopharyngeal aspirate procedure induces a cough and sputum production, which is then aspirated from the nasopharynx. Stool specimens were collected daily for 2 days. All specimens from cases were obtained in the hospital within 5 days of enrolment, before starting antituberculosis treatment. Blood samples were taken from cases for measurement of serum albumin, as an indicator of nutritional status. Specimens taken from controls for tuberculosis cultures and PCR assays were one nasopharyngeal-aspirate and two stool samples. No gastric-aspirate specimens were obtained from controls because of the invasive nature of the test, and only one nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken from each control because this test is unpleasant for some children, and repeat nasopharyngeal-aspirate testing of controls was not acceptable to many parents.   Tuberculosis diagnostic techniques Specimens were decontaminated with 0·5% N-acetyl-L-cysteine, 2% sodium hydroxide, and 1·45% sodium citrate, and the centrifuged pellet was resuspended in 2 mL 0·2% bovine serum albumin. 18  Before decontamination, stool samples were prepared by suspension of 0·1 g in 6 mL phosphate buffered saline, homogenisation, and settling for 10 min to separate, after which the supernatant was processed. This stool processing technique was shown in pilot work to provide the best possible compromise between detection sensitivity versus culture contamination. Specimens were tested by four methods. To reduce the risk of bias, samples were obtained from cases and randomly selected matched controls, and technicians were not aware of clinical characteristics, identity of participant groups, or the results of other tests. In the first method, microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility (MODS), 19,20  500 ?L of each decontaminated specimen was inoculated into modified Middlebrook 7H9 media and separated into four 1·2 mL samples that were cultured in a sterile 24-well plate. Plates were placed in a plastic resealable bag, incubated at 37°C, and examined every other day without opening for up to 30 days by inverted light microscopy. Presumptive M tuberculosis isolates with cording morphology were reported as positive and all were subsequently confirmed by heminested IS6110 M tuberculosis PCR. Direct concurrent drug susceptibility testing was not done. The second method was Lowenstein-Jensen agar culture. 250 ?L of each decontaminated specimen was inoculated onto a Lowenstein-Jensen slant, incubated at 37°C, and examined two times a week from the first to eighth week after inoculation. In the third test, auramine stain (smear test), two drops of each decontaminated specimen were dried on a microscope slide, stained with 0·1% auramine O (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and examined at 100-times magnification. Positive tests had five or more bacilli counted in 300 fields. N2 IS6110 PCR procedure (referred to as PCR testing) was the fourth method. 21  DNA was extracted from 500 ?L of each decontaminated specimen, and two consecutive nested IS6110 PCRs were done with outer and inner primers. To reduce the risk of false-positive PCR reactions, separate rooms were used for DNA extraction, PCR mix preparation, amplification, and electrophoresis with protective clothing. Every heminested PCR assay included positive controls of genomic M tuberculosis DNA and negative controls of water added to the PCR reagents in place of the sample DNA.   Statistical analysis We calculated a sample size to detect a 15% difference in sensitivity of detection of M tuberculosis between two tests done in the same individuals (eg, gastric aspirates vs nasopharyngeal aspirates) or between detection methods (eg, MODS vs Lowenstein-Jensen culture; culture vs PCR) or between cases and controls. On the basis of 80% power and an ? error of p=0·05, 189 cases and 189 controls were required. To compensate for non-evaluable individuals (eg, second sample not provided), we increased the study sample by 10% to a target sample of 210–220 cases and an equal number of controls. Demographic and clinical data, and culture and PCR results were compared in cases and controls by Stegen-Toledo risk group (moderate risk vs high risk). Culture and PCR results were compared by sample and by person. A negative culture result was deemed valid (ie, readable and contamination-free) if at least one valid Lowenstein-Jensen and one valid MODS result was available. A case with negative cultures was valid if all three types of specimen (gastric aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and stool sample) had valid results for duplicate specimens. For controls, nasopharyngeal-aspirate and stool cultures required valid results for inclusion in the analysis. ?2 and McNemar's tests were used for categorical variables; two-tailed t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for continuous variables. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for potentially confounding variables. Recovery rates for M tuberculosis were compared by culture method for cases and specimens, grouped by specimen type (gastric aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool sample) and by auramine stain result. Cases with at least one clinical specimen that was culture positive for M tuberculosis by any method were included in the culture-positive group. Data analysis was done with STATA version 11 and EpiInfo version 6. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00054769.   Role of the funding source The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study, had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication, and takes responsibility for the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

2676,S1201971209002987,Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcome in Iran: a case series of seven patients," 2 Methods and results Second-line drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB have been available in Iran since 2002. 10,11  According to Iran's National TB Treatment Protocol, all TB patients with WHO regimen category I (CAT I) and category II (CAT II) failures are referred to our center for evaluation and treatment of MDR-TB. This study was carried out at the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (NRITLD) at Masih Daneshvari Hospital, the sole national referral center for TB in Iran, which includes the National Mycobacteriologic Reference Laboratory. All patients with documented MDR-TB based on drug susceptibility testing (DST) are treated with the standard second-line regimen, consisting of cycloserine, prothionamide, amikacin, and ofloxacin. First-line drugs such as ethambutol and pyrazinamide are added to the regimen if the DST shows sensitivity to these drugs. For those patients with MDR-TB, second-line drug susceptibility tests are performed as well. Between 2002 and 2006, 105 patients with suspected MDR-TB were identified at Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Of these patients, seven (6.6%) were diagnosed with XDR-TB; their DST results became available later in the course of therapy. A brief description of each case follows. ",0
2726,S1684118213002454,Disseminated tuberculosis presenting as tuberculous peritonitis and sepsis tuberculosa gravissima in a patient with cirrhosis of the liver: A diagnosis of challenge," Case report An 81-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous cerebrovascular accident was brought to our emergency department with stupor for 1 day. He reported progressive abdominal distension, anorexia, and limb edema for 2 weeks prior to presentation. There was neither fever nor cough with sputum. One day prior to admission, he developed stupor. In the emergency department, his initial physical examination showed a blood pressure of 138/61 mmHg, body temperature 37.3°C, heart rate 123 beats/minute, and respiratory rate 21 breaths/minute. The initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V2M3. Pale conjunctiva, abdominal distension with shifting dullness, spider angioma over the chest wall, and palmar erythema were also found. There was no focal neurological sign such as eye deviation or limb weakness. A computed tomography scan of his brain disclosed several tiny hypodense lesions involving bilateral basal ganglia and left periventricular white matter in favor of old lacunar infarction. His laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 15.19 × 109/L with 84% granulocytes, 12% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes. Hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL, the mean corpuscular volume was 88.4 fL/red cell, and the platelet count was 332,000/mm3. Serum electrolyte levels were 139 mmol/L Na (normal range 135–147 mmol/L), 3.8 mmol/L K (normal range 3.4–4.7 mmol/L), and 8.3 mg/dL Ca (normal range 8.4–10.6 mg/dL). The renal function test showed 34 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen (normal range 7–20 mg/dL) and 2.1 mg/dL serum creatinine (normal range 0.7–1.5 mg/dL). Liver function tests showed 10 U/L glutamate pyruvate transaminase (normal range 0–40), 91 U/L ?-glutamyl transpeptidase (normal range 8–60 U/L), 89 U/L alkaline phosphatase (normal range 42–128 U/L), and 57 ?g/dL serum ammonia (normal range 12–66 ?g/dL). The viral hepatitis test gave a negative result for anti-HCV antibody and HBs antigen and a positive result for anti-HBs antibody. The family did not report a history of alcoholism in the patient. A chest radiograph showed a band-like lesion over the right lower lung field (Fig. 1 ) which was not seen on previous chest radiographs. The family reported an episode of choking while the patient was in stupor. Cefoxitin (2 g every 12 hours) was initially administered intravenously to treat suspected aspiration pneumonia based on the case history and findings of the chest radiograph. Kidney, ureter, and bladder radiographs showed floating bowel gas, indicating ascites formation. An abdominal computed tomography scan (Fig. 2 ) showed findings compatible with liver cirrhosis. Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis showed turbid fluid with a white blood cell count of 3510/mm 3  with 65% granulocytes, 30% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, 2 g/L total protein, and 388 g/L lactate dehydrogenase. Gram staining and acid-fast staining of ascites were both negative. The serum–ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was >1.1 g/dL. Shock with acute respiratory failure developed on Day 1 of hospitalization and the patient was intubated, ventilated mechanically, and given fluid resuscitation and inotropic drugs. An initial sputum smear showed a high polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count with a predominance of GNB. With a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis complicated with SBP, multiple organ failure, and GNB pneumonia, antibiotic treatment was changed to cefotaxime 2 g every 8 hours.  Table 1  gives the serial analysis of the ascites fluid. Initially, the patient's vital signs and level of consciousness improved gradually and the repeat analysis of ascites also showed a reduction in the PMN cell count. On Day 4 of hospitalization, however, his clinical condition deteriorated again and shock with multiple organ failure was exacerbated despite fluid hydration and the use of inotropic drugs. The sputum culture grew Enterobacter cloacae. Four sets of ascites bacterial cultures showed negative results. Based on culture-negative neutrocystic ascites, tuberculous peritonitis and malignancy could not be excluded. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed no evidence of a primary tumor with peritoneal carcinomatosis. We looked for other evidence of disseminated TB and collected TB culture from sputum, ascites fluid, urine, and blood, but the families declined lumbar puncture. The sputum acid-fast staining was positive (3+). We changed the antibiotic treatment to cefepime and started antituberculous treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide on Day 4 of hospitalization. On Day 6 of hospitalization, the patient died due to refractory shock and multiple organ failure. One month later, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was isolated from the blood, ascites, and sputum culture. ",0
2733,S2052297515000669,Prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases among HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients eligible for retreatment regimen in Togo using GeneXpert MTB/RIF," Materials and methods  Sample and selection criteria This study was conducted in Togo in the mycobacteria reference laboratory from January 2013 to June 2013. Ethical approval was obtained from the Université de Lomé institutional review board. All participants provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analyses. Sputum samples were collected from previously TB-treated HIV-positive and -negative patients who had TB according to the definition established by the World Health Organization (WHO): relapse, failure or default (https://www.cap-tb.org/resources/tb-case-definitions-revision-6-may-2011). Samples were obtained from patients all over the country and were sent to the reference laboratory in a cooler box (4–8°C) within 24 hours of sample collection for the closest sites and stored in a refrigerator for microscopy, culture, Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) drug susceptibility testing (DST) and GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay.   HIV testing Alere Determine HIV-1/2 (Alere, Yavne, Israel) and HIV Tri-dot (J. Mitra, New Delhi, India) tests were used to screen for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection.   Microscopy Microscopy was performed on all collected samples using Ziehl-Neelsen staining, which is available in all peripheral health care centre laboratories in Togo.   Culture Both the BACTEC MGIT 960 system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) (liquid media) and Löwenstein-Jensen agar were systematically used for sputum culture samples, irrespective of smear microscopy result. Positive growth without contaminant was confirmed by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and by the rapid test confirmation kit (i.e. MPT64 protein detection-based immunochomatographic test; SD Bioline Kit, Standard Diagnostics, Yongin-si, Korea) [11]. The interpretation of results was based on the manufacturer's instructions. Positive results were considered as belonging to M. tuberculosis complex. Negative results were regarded as atypical mycobacteria and were not taken into account in this study.   Drug susceptibility testing Conventional DST using the BACTEC MGIT 960 system [12] and GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) [13,14] were used simultaneously to screen all cases for any resistance pattern present. The interpretations of results were based on the manufacturer's instructions.   Statistical analysis Agreement, sensitivity and specificity, and values of the BACTEC MGIT 960 system for DST compared to GeneXpert MTB/RIF were calculated for RIF. The agreement between the two methods was determined by the ? statistic. The ? value, a measure of test reliability, was interpreted as follows: <0.2, poor; 0.21 to 0.4, fair; 0.41 to 0.6, moderate; 0.61 to 0.8, good; and ?0.81, excellent [15].  ",0
2760,S1028455911001276,Disseminated peritoneal tuberculosis simulating advanced ovarian cancer: A retrospective study of 17 cases," Materials and methods We retrospectively examined the medical records of patients with peritoneal TB that mimicked advanced ovarian cancer who were managed at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital—Kaohsiung Medical Center, Taiwan, over a period of 22 years between July 1986 and December 2008. In total, 27 patients were diagnosed as having peritoneal TB according to pathology reports, and 17 of them presented with initial symptoms and signs that were similar to those of advanced ovarian cancer. Patients diagnosed as having peritoneal TB but not simulating advanced ovarian cancer were not included in the present study. We analyzed those 17 patients’ clinical presentations; findings on pelvic examination; laboratory results; CA-125 levels; chest radiographic findings; examination of ascites; imaging studies, such as ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT); and diagnostic procedures. The diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of at least one of the following criteria, as advocated by Pauslian et al [6]: (1) histological evidence of caseating granulomatous inflammation; (2) acid-fast bacilli identified in tissue specimens or ascitic fluid; (3) tissue or ascitic fluid culture yielding M tuberculosis; (4) positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M tuberculosis DNA on tissue specimens or ascitic fluid; or (5) a good therapeutic response to anti-TB agents in patients with clinical evidence of peritoneal TB. All data were obtained from patients’ files and pathology reports. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Institutional Review Board No. 98-2016B).

2799,S2212553114000168,"Active tuberculosis case finding and detection of drug resistance among HIV-infected patients: A cross-sectional study in a TB endemic area, Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia"," Materials and methods  Study design and participants A cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2012 and November 2012 among HIV patients attending the ARV clinic at the Gondar University Hospital, a tertiary-level teaching and referral hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 250 consecutive HIV patients, aged 18years and above and who at least had one of the TB symptoms (cough, night sweats, fever or weight loss), but undiagnosed during their visit at the clinic were enrolled. In addition, patients with a history of previous TB and those on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) or pre-ART were also enrolled. Those patients with severe illness and unable to provide sputum and who already started anti-TB treatment or IPT were excluded. Socio-demographic features (Table 1 ) and clinical data (Table 2 ), including chest X-ray findings, were collected using structured questionnaires. The clinical presentation of HIV positive cases were non-specific, such as an acute mononucleosis-like illness accompanied by fevers, sweats, malaise, lethargy, anorexia, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy and rash [16].   Sputum collection and processing Three sputum samples (spot-morning-spot samples) were collected from all eligible participants, pooled and a direct acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy was performed using the conventional Ziehl–Neelsen staining technique at the Gondar Microbiology Laboratory as described earlier [17]. The remaining aliquots of sputa were transported in a cold chain from Gondar Microbiology Laboratory to the P3 TB laboratory facility at Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI), Addis Ababa, for Mycobacterium culture, RD typing and drug susceptibility testing.   Mycobacterial culture Sputum samples were decontaminated and homogenized by the modified Petroff’s method as described previously [18]. Briefly, about 1ml of the sediment was inoculated into the conventional Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) egg slant medium containing 0.6% sodium pyruvate and glycerol for primary isolation. After inoculation, LJ slants were held for 8weeks at 37°C and visually inspected for growth every day for the first week and twice per week thereafter for the total of 8weeks for the presence of mycobacterial colonies. Microscopic examinations of the colonies were performed using Ziehl–Neelsen staining method so as to select AFB positive isolates.   Molecular typing Heat-killed cells were prepared from AFB positive isolates by mixing two loops-full of colonies in 200?l of distilled water and by heating at 80oC for one hour. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based deletion typing was performed to check for the presence or absence of regions of difference-9 (RD9) so as to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) from other species of Mycobacteria [19]. The method was applied to heat-killed mycobacterial suspensions. A multiplex PCR was designed to amplify the non-deleted RD9 region. Two external primers (RD9_FlankFW: 5?-AACACGGTCACGTTGTCGTG-3? and RD9_FlankRev: 5?-CAAACCAGCAGCTGTCGTTG-3?) and one internal reverse primer (RD9_InternalR: 5?-TTGCTTCCCCGGTTCGTCTG-3?) were used per locus. After identification by RD9 typing, Mycobacterium genus typing was performed from non-deleted RD9 region to further differentiate species of the M. tuberculosis complex from other Mycobacterium species. A reference strain of M. tuberculosis, H37Rv (ATCC 27249) and water were also run simultaneously with samples in every reaction as positive and negative controls, respectively.   Drug susceptibility testing (DST) Indirect drug susceptibility testing was performed for first-line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin), based on proportion method on 24-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, USA) using Middlebrook 7H10 medium supplemented with glycerol and 10% oleic acid albumin dextrose catalase (OADC; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). Primary isolates grown within 2–3weeks were used for preparing the suspension, then the DST plates were inoculated by adding 10?l of the suspension which was adjusted with McFarland standard. The plates were securely sealed with Parafilm and incubated at 35°C in a 5% CO2 incubator with a water reservoir. Drug susceptibility was determined by visually comparing the drug containing media (1:1 bacterial suspensions) with the drug-free control on which 1:100 bacterial suspensions was inoculated. The drug sensitivity of the bacterial isolate was later determined using the critical concentration level as recommended by the WHO 2009 [20].   Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed using SPSS software packages Version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 2011, USA). Descriptive statistics was used to report patient socio-demographics and clinical data, prevalence of undiagnosed pulmonary TB and rates of MDR-TB. Logistic regression and odds ratio were used to measure the degree of association between the different variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.   Ethical consideration The study received ethical approval from the ethics board of the University of Gondar, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, and AHRI/ALERT Ethics Review Committee and all participants gave written informed consent.

2832,S1473309906706582,A case for passive immunoprophylaxis against tuberculosis," Mechanisms of M tuberculosis/HIV co-infection HIV-mediated immune deficiency is known to be selective for certain microbial pathogens, but the mechanisms beh ind the specific loss of resistance against tuberculosis are poorly understood. Furthermore, the reverse effect of M tuberculosis infection on HIV replication is of considerable importance. Enhanced HIV replication in monocytes and macrophages has been shown at the site of disease in co-infected lymph nodes, 13,14  attributed to mycobacteria-induced nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ? mediated activation of the HIV long terminal repeat sequence. 15  Paradoxically, recent results from in-vitro experiments suggest that soluble factors released by M tuberculosis inhibit HIV replication after viral entry, and before or during early transcription in human monocyte-derived macrophages. 16  The effective factor from M tuberculosis has been identified as Z-100 arabinomannan. 17  The influence of M tuberculosis infection on the course of HIV progression in patients has also been a subject of controversial reports, 16  presumably because of the complexity of simultaneously occurring multifactorial events. In the event of an adverse outcome, whether it results from tuberculosis itself or from immunosuppression by progressing AIDS is not understood. ",0
2838,S1473309909703263,Yield of HIV-associated tuberculosis during intensified case finding in resource-limited settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis," Methods  Search strategy and selection criteria The searches and review process were done according to a prespecified protocol. We aimed to identify studies using intensified case finding in resource-limited settings. Both cross-sectional and cohort studies published in all languages were eligible for inclusion. We searched available systematic and narrative reviews for active case finding and household-contact investigations. Two systematic reviews were identified. 8,14  Additionally, we searched Medline, EmBase, and Global Health for reports published through April, 2009, and African Health Line up to March, 2009. Search strategies are presented in the webappendix. The search strategy for African Health Line included “tuberculosis”, “active or intensified or enhanced case finding”, “prisons or prisoners”, “mines or miners”, “homosexuals”, “voluntary counselling”, and “testing or VCT”. Abstract books covering the years 1998–2008 of the World Conference on Lung Health published by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease were hand searched. Reference lists of primary studies, reviews, and editorials identified by the above methods were hand searched. Experts in the specialty were contacted for additional publications. According to the WHO 3Is policy, regular screening for tuberculosis is recommended in groups at high risk of infection with HIV, individuals infected with HIV, groups living in congregate settings, and in contacts of people with tuberculosis. The strategy to be used in contact tracing is not explicitly described in the policy, and so for the purposes of this Review we focused on contact tracing studies in populations where the prevalence of HIV was at least 5% among notified cases of tuberculosis. We also defined groups at high risk for infection with HIV as prisoners, commercial sex workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, and individuals attending voluntary counselling and testing centres and sexually transmitted disease clinics. Even though the 3Is policy does not recommend mass screening on a population level, it is arguable that general populations in sub-Saharan Africa constitute groups at high risk for HIV. Thus, surveys of the prevalence of tuberculosis in populations with a prevalence of HIV of greater than 5% were included in this Review. Our Review was limited to studies published from 1993 (when WHO declared tuberculosis to be a worldwide emergency) to 2009. 15  We only included studies in low-income and middle-income countries, as defined by the World Bank in 2008, 16  and studies that screened a minimum of 100 people. We excluded editorials, case studies, case reports, studies screening only children younger than 15 years, and studies with unclear screening strategies or denominators. However, we included contact-tracing studies that screened both adults and children. The initial database created from the electronic searches was compiled, duplicate citations were eliminated, and citations were screened by title and abstract to capture potentially relevant studies. The full text of these studies was obtained and reviewed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening of full text from citations found to be potentially relevant was done by two reviewers (KK and SDL). Queries on study design and study quality were discussed with another reviewer (JRG), and studies were only included if there was consensus.   Data extraction and analysis Where data from a single study were present in multiple publications, these data were compiled. The data extraction form was adapted from the STROBE statement checklist. 17  Variables recorded included title, objective, year of study, year of publication, study design, setting, eligibility criteria of participants, sources and methods of selection of participants, screening strategy, diagnostic criteria for tuberculosis, internal and external quality checks, efforts to reduce bias, numbers of individuals at each stage of the study, number of cases of tuberculosis, prevalence of tuberculosis, and funding source. One reviewer (KK) extracted data from all eligible studies. A second reviewer (SDL) independently extracted data from 20 of the included studies. The ratings given by the two reviewers were in complete agreement. Primary outcome of interest was the yield of intensified case finding as defined by the prevalence of newly microbiologically confirmed or clinically or radiologically diagnosed cases of tuberculosis in the target population and the NNS to find one new case of tuberculosis. The NNS was calculated as the reciprocal of the prevalence of newly diagnosed tuberculosis. Secondary outcomes of interest were the screening strategy used, treatment outcomes, and cost per case found. All analyses were done in Stata 10. We report medians and ranges; weighted medians were used to compare yield of screening for tuberculosis in individuals infected with HIV by use of different screening strategies. We used inverse-variance-weighted metaregression to investigate the association between yield of intensified case finding and country prevalence of tuberculosis, prevalence of HIV in the general population, screening strategies, availability of culture, and HIV status of the study population. 18,19  Country prevalence estimates for tuberculosis and HIV were obtained from the WHO Global Health Atlas. 20  We analysed residuals to check model assumptions.

2868,S019643991400018X,A Case of Tuberculosis Presenting as a Perianal Abscess," Case History A 26-year-old heterosexual male was seen in the emergency department with a 4- day history of burning pain around his anal area. He had not responded to a topical cream prescribed 3 days previously. Of note, he had lived in Canada for 4.5 years but had recently returned from a 4-month visit to his native country, Afghanistan. He denied fever or chills but admitted to a dry cough over the past month. His pain had increased to the point where he was unable to defecate or urinate. On examination, he complained of excruciating pain in the perianal area and had a fever of 38.3°C. No other abnormalities were present on the examination. However, his chest X ray revealed a 3.5-cm round density with a central lucency in the right lung. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest confirmed the presence of a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe with thickened walls and numerous tree-in-bud infiltrates. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 2.4- by 3.1- by 2.7-cm perianal abscess with no evidence of fistula tracts. Laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 12,200 per ml with normal levels for hemoglobin, creatinine, and serum transaminases. The urinalysis was normal, and the urine culture was negative. A test for HIV antibody was negative. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy the same day, and abundant acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were present on a stained-smear examination of the bronchial aspirate. The perianal abscess was incised and drained. The Gram-stained smear showed 50 to 75 WBCs per low-power field and >1 gram-positive cocci. The routine bacterial culture grew Escherichia coli and viridans group streptococci. An acid-fast stained smear was not performed on the abscess fluid, but it was sent for AFB culture. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 10 days and was also started on isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide pending the final culture results. The AFB cultures from both the bronchoscopy fluid and the perianal abscess specimen subsequently grew M. tuberculosis, which was susceptible to all antibiotics tested. On follow-up examination, the patient did not complain of rectal pain or cough and was treated with an additional 6-month course of antimycobacterial therapy. ",0
2929,S0967586806002165,Calvarial tuberculosis as the initial presentation of AIDS," 2 Discussion Although tuberculosis continues to be one of the most common causes of morbidity worldwide and the most frequent cause of mortality among HIV-positive individuals living in developing countries, 1  it is becoming a more significant medical problem also in industrialised countries because of rising levels of immigration and immunosuppressed patient populations. The incidence of tuberculosis, and in particular tuberculosis in extrapulmonary locations, is much higher in HIV-infected patients than in other patients. 2  Tuberculous osteomyelitis occurs in approximately 1% of patients with mycobacterial infection, and involvement of the skull is even rarer, accounting for only 1% of all cases of skeletal tuberculosis. 3–5  Calvarial tuberculosis is believed to occur via the haematogenous seeding of bacilli to the diploe, and the lungs are usually the primary site of infection, 6  as seen in our case. The frontal and parietal bones are most commonly involved, probably because they contain a greater amount of cancellous bone and more diploic structures. 7  Because the imaging features of calvarial tuberculosis are not specific, 8  histologic or microbiologic confirmation is mandatory before specific therapy is initiated. In fact, many diseases must be considered in the differential diagnosis, including pyogenic osteomyelitis, calvarial metastasis, myeloma, meningioma, and histiocytosis X. 5  We believe the present case is of interest because the occurrence of calvarial tuberculosis was the initial manifestation of HIV-associated immunodeficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of calvarial tuberculosis in an HIV-infected patient. Indeed, although a worldwide resurgence of tuberculosis in combination with the HIV pandemic has occurred in recent years, skeletal tuberculosis is described infrequently among patients with HIV infection. 9,10  This report emphasises the need to include calvarial tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis, especially in patients who have lived in endemic areas, in whom it may be the first manifestation of their HIV infection.

2961,S120197121500212X,"Predictors of mortality and treatment success during treatment for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis within the South African National TB Programme, 2009 to 2011: a cohort analysis of the national case register"," 2 Methods A retrospective, de-identified secondary analysis of the routinely reported EDRweb database was conducted. TB and DR-TB are notifiable diseases in South Africa, and the National TB Programme (NTP) maintains national case registration databases. The EDRweb has been the electronic case registration database for the South African NTP since 2009; however, the paper-based registers were used for reporting to the WHO until 2012. A census of patients registered in the EDRweb from January 1, 2009 up to September 30, 2011, with follow-up until September 30, 2013, was exported for analysis (n =22 152).  2.1 DR-TB treatment guidelines and case definitions 2009–2011 MDR-TB is defined as DR-TB that is resistant to RIF and isoniazid (INH). Although drug-sensitive TB can be diagnosed based upon clinical indications, South African guidelines require bacteriological laboratory confirmation of MDR-TB. At initiation of second-line treatment and if not improving clinically, a patient who has MDR-TB is tested for further anti-TB drug resistance. Resistance to RIF and INH plus any fluoroquinolone (FLQ) and any second-line injectable drug (SLID) is defined as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Resistance to RIF and INH and either a FLQ or a SLID is referred to as preXDR-TB. Until new guidelines were issued in 2011, 2  most South African DR-TB patients were treated as inpatients at specialized, provincial-level M/XDR-TB treatment centres. 2  South African NTP guidelines prior to 2011 indicated that patients with at least MDR-TB should be hospitalized for 6 months or until they achieved culture conversion, defined as two consecutive months with culture-negative sputa. 3   The Xpert MTB/RIF test for the diagnosis of TB and RIF resistance was not available within the South African NTP during the study period. Patients at high risk of having DR-TB as a result of being a contact of a person with DR-TB, or due to failure to smear convert during TB treatment, were targeted for DR-TB testing. Diagnosis relied mainly on phenotypic drug sensitivity testing (DST) of culture isolates. The National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) rolled out line probe assay (LPA) genotypic testing on culture isolates from 2009 to 2011, 4  and the results from LPA were reported for RIF and INH if available. DST was performed through the NHLS specialized laboratories for a panel of first-line drugs: RIF, INH, ethambutol (EMB), and streptomycin (SM). If at least MDR-TB, then a panel of second-line drugs would be tested: kanamycin (KM), ofloxacin (OFX), and ethionamide (ETO). Each panel of DST cultures took 6 to 12 weeks for results. Patients with RIF resistance or MDR-TB were treated with a standardized regimen, 3  consisting of two phases. The 6-month intensive phase (usually hospitalized) included daily dosing of a SLID, KM, or amikacin (AM) and four additional oral drugs: OFX, EMB or ETO, terizidone (TZD), and pyrazinamide (PZA). The continuation phase of treatment included continuation of the regimen for 18 months following culture conversion, with the exception of the SLID. Patients with XDR-TB or documented resistance to either a FLQ or SLID (preXDR) could access individualized regimens including the SLID capreomycin, moxifloxacin (MFX), para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), or clofazimine. Outcomes of DR-TB treatment were assigned at the end of treatment (typically 24 months) and were defined at the time as: ‘cured’, i.e. completed treatment and culture-negative for five consecutive months in the last year of treatment; ‘completed’, i.e. completed treatment but did not meet the definition of cured; ‘died’, i.e. death due to any cause while on DR-TB treatment; ‘default’ (lost to treatment follow-up), i.e. treatment interrupted for two or more consecutive months; ‘failure’, i.e. two or more positive cultures out of the five consecutive cultures taken in the final year of treatment; or ‘still on treatment’ at the time of report. 3  Treatment success was defined as the sum of patients who were either cured or completed treatment.   2.2 HIV treatment guidelines 2009–2011 In April 2010, the South African guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) were updated to indicate that all M/XDR-TB patients, regardless of CD4 count, were eligible for ART initiation and should be fast-tracked for initiation. 5  Prior to this (the 2004 guidelines), only patients who had a CD4 count of <200 cells/mm3 were eligible and there was uncertainty as to the timing of initiation of ART for TB patients. 6     2.3 EDRweb and data extraction De-duplication and cleaning of the register was done as per the standard policies and procedures of the NTP prior to export. Follow-up data were censored at September 30, 2013. All patient records included in the study had at least 24 months of follow-up time. All patient identifiers were removed during the export process. Patients were excluded if they had no record of initiating DR-TB treatment within EDRweb (n =3743). Patients who were reported to have only mono-resistant TB and no laboratory RIF result (i.e., mono-INH-resistant, n =462), who were reported as transfer-in (n =223), or who were missing a DR-TB diagnosis (n =27), were also excluded from the analysis. Thus, only patients with at least RIF-resistant TB were included in the analysis. Patient and treatment characteristics analysed included age, sex, history of previous TB treatment, year of registration, TB foci (extrapulmonary or pulmonary), reported drug resistance, diagnosis of drug-resistant TB, HIV status, baseline smear and culture results, and DR-TB treatment. Age at registration was categorized as <15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–59, and 60 years and older. Each patient could have multiple DST result sets reported. Each entry was numbered, with the month of testing reported (month 0 for treatment initiation, month 1 after 1 month of treatment, etc.), date of sputum collection, laboratory specimen number, and the drugs that had a resistant outcome. Drugs that were tested that had a sensitive, non-viable isolate, or contaminated result, were not reported. For the analysis, month 0 reports were defined as baseline. Patient diagnosis was reported in the dataset as one of MDR-TB, mono- or poly-resistant DR-TB, or XDR-TB. For the analysis, if a patient was diagnosed as MDR-TB and had a reported DST result of resistance to a FLQ or a SLID, this was categorized as preXDR-TB. Each patient could have multiple HIV tests reported. Each entry was numbered, with the date of testing and results. Additionally, HIV status was reported as a separate variable, presumably to incorporate patients with known HIV status who were not tested and counselled for HIV during DR-TB treatment. Any report of the patient being HIV-infected was recorded as the patient being HIV-infected. If no tests were reported as HIV-positive and there was at least one HIV report of being HIV-negative, the patient was recorded as HIV-negative. ART started was a ‘yes/no’ variable. Patients were categorized as HIV-negative, HIV-positive on ART, HIV-positive not on ART or ART status unknown, or HIV status unknown. Each patient had multiple monthly sputum smear microscopy and sputum culture tests reported – up to 40 entries. Smear status was reported as negative or positive, but no specific grading (i.e. scant, +, ++, +++) was given. There was also a report of an ‘initial’ smear and culture result (defined as being taken prior to referral to the DR-TB unit) and a ‘baseline’ smear and culture result (defined as the sputum specimen taken on admission to the DR-TB unit). A positive smear result in the baseline, initial, or month 0 report was defined as smear-positive at baseline for the analysis; the same definition and method was applied to establish baseline culture results. Second-line TB drugs were recorded in EDRweb as a list of drugs that may have been prescribed for either the intensive or continuation phase, or because of a regimen change during treatment. Doses, the duration of treatment, and the reasons for treatment changes are not reported within EDRweb. One treatment outcome is retained in EDRweb with one outcome date; the outcome may be changed after cohort reporting (e.g., 24-month outcomes reported to the WHO). The treatment outcome date reflected the date of reporting or assignment of the outcome at 24 months. For death, treatment failure, and loss to follow-up, the outcome date was defined as the date the patient was last at the facility, not necessarily the date of the event.   2.4 Statistical analysis All analyses were conducted in Stata SE version 13 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA). Patient and treatment characteristics were recorded using the median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables, and the frequency and proportion for categorical variables. Predictors of treatment outcome (either treatment success or death) were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors to produce relative risks (risk ratios, or RR); 7  these were reported with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The univariate and adjusted (multivariate) results are presented.   2.5 Ethics Ethical approval for this de-identified, retrospective secondary analysis of routinely reported patient-level data was received from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand.

3001,S1472979208000498,A proposal for applying molecular markers as an aid to identifying potential cases of imported tuberculosis in immigrants," Methods  Patients The distribution of nationalities among immigrants in Spain is not homogeneous; therefore, we selected samples from three independent cities (Madrid, Barcelona, and Almería) in order to ensure the widest profile of nationalities. We analyzed 168 MTBC isolates from three long-term population-based molecular epidemiology studies performed in Madrid (2004–2006, population 1,459,232 inhabitants 126 selected cases), Barcelona (2003–2004, population 1,582,738 inhabitants 25 selected cases) and Almería (2004–2006, population 635,850 inhabitants 17 selected cases). The first selection criterion was to choose cases that were unclustered in the respective molecular epidemiology studies, in order to rule out recently acquired/transmitted infections and to work with potentially imported cases. For the Asian cases, we selected all the microbiologically diagnosed cases from two molecular epidemiology studies run in Madrid (2004–2006; 22 cases) and Barcelona (2003–2004; 25 cases). For the other nationalities, the core of the selection was the molecular epidemiology study from Madrid. We selected a sample of non-Asian immigrant cases (65 cases) according to the real distribution of nationalities found in Madrid, thereby ensuring a higher percentage for the four main nationalities (Ecuador, Morocco, Peru, and Romania; 44 cases). We also selected a sample of 21 cases representing a wide variety of the immigrant nationalities in Madrid (15 nationalities). With regard to the autochthonous cases, we selected 44 orphan cases (potentially imported), each of which had a different genotyping pattern. The samples from Almería were used as a convenience sample to complete representatives of some nationalities absent in Madrid. Therefore, we analyzed 124 isolates from foreign-born cases (31 different nationalities) and 44 from autochthonous cases.   Molecular analysis  Analysis of pks15/1 The DNA was purified according to standardized methods. 18  The pks15/1 gene was amplified as indicated elsewhere and sequenced to analyze whether it was intact (pks+) or whether it had the 7-bp deletion (pks?).   Spoligotyping Spoligotyping was performed using primers of the spoligotyping kit (Isogen, Netherlands) and following the manufacturer's instructions. The spoligotypes were analyzed in the MIRU-VNTRplus application (www.miru-vntrplus.org) 19  in order to identify the genetic lineages described in the SpolDB4 database (http://www.pasteur-guadeloupe.fr/tb/spoldb4/spoldb4.pdf). The MIRU-VNTRplus application identified lineages with a distance lower than 0.15 to the representative strains for each SpolDB4 lineage in its database.   MIRU locus 24 analysis The analysis of the number of repetitions in MIRU locus 24 was performed as previously indicated. 20  Isolates containing two or more repeats in this locus belong to the ancestral (TbD1+) group, whereas those with one repeat belong to the modern (TbD1?) groups. 13,14     ",0

3049,S0163445311001204,Interferon gamma release assay for differentiating tuberculosis among pneumonia cases in acute healthcare setting," Materials and methods  The study A prospective study was conducted over a period of 20 months (from October 2006 through May 2008) in the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH). PWH is a 1300-bed acute, general public hospital operating under the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, which serves an urban population of >1.5 million. 10  Patients aged 18 or above, who were hospitalized because of radiographic pneumonia 11  and suspected of having active PTB by the managing physicians were consecutively recruited. Exclusion criteria included the inability to produce sputum for mycobacterial smear/culture, and lack of consent. Peripheral blood samples were then collected for IGRA after obtaining written consent (see below). As this study involved no intervention and all investigation results were unknown to the clinicians except for AFB-smears, patients were managed and discharged according to usual clinical practices. All discharged patients were reviewed in the out-patient clinic for their mycobacterial culture results and clinical progress. Informed consent was obtained for every subject; ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong.   Definitions and investigations Baseline characteristics, clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients were recorded using a standard data acquisition form. Expectorated sputum samples were collected at presentation on three consecutive days, and were examined for AFB using auramine O fluorescent stain, followed by Ziehl-Neelsen staining for confirmation. 12  All sputum samples were subjected to mycobacterial culture using Lowenstein–Jensen medium. One peripheral blood sample (5 ml) was collected for QFN-G assay upon recruitment, prior to the initiation of anti-tuberculous treatment (see next section). The results were unknown to the managing physicians. Other investigations such as bronchoscopy or tissue biopsy were performed by the managing physicians when deemed necessary. Definitive diagnosis of PTB was established by positive cultures for M. tuberculosis and/or histological confirmation of tuberculous infection. Cases were classified as ‘non-PTB’ if the mycobacterial culture results remained negative after 8 weeks, and an alternative diagnosis was obtained. Plain chest radiographs were performed for every patient at presentation. All images were retrospectively reviewed by a senior radiologist to record the location, extent and nature of abnormalities. 13  ‘Typical PTB features’ on radiographs was defined by the presence of acinar nodules and/or consolidation in the upper lobes, cavitating consolidation, or miliary nodules. 14   For comparison, peripheral blood samples were also collected for IGRA from a separate group of asymptomatic out-patients (n = 32). The study subjects were recruited from the general medical clinics of PWH; all subjects were assessed by the participating physicians to confirm the absence of symptoms of active TB, and there was no history or known exposure to tuberculosis.   Interferon-? release assay (IGRA) In this study, QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFN-G) assay (Cellestis, Australia), which is one of the IGRAs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis of latent TB infection and TB disease, 15  and being commercially available in our region in year 2006, was used. The assay was performed and interpreted according to manufacturer’s instructions (Cellestis). 16  In brief, 1 ml aliquot of heparinised whole blood from each subject was incubated within 12 h of phlebotomy with stimulation antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10 and mitogen) and nil control for 16–24 h at 37 °C. Plasma was then harvested for interferon-? measurement using enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results were calculated and interpreted using QuantiFERON-TB Gold Analysis Software. A result was considered ‘positive’ if ESAT minus nil control and/or CFP-10 minus nil control were ?0.35IU/ml, and ?25% of nil. Otherwise, the result was considered ‘negative’ if mitogen minus nil was ?0.5IU/ml, or ‘indeterminate’ if mitogen minus nil was <0.5IU/ml (low mitogen response).   Statistical analysis Clinical, laboratory and radiographic variables, and IGRA results were compared between patients with confirmed ‘active PTB’ and ‘non-PTB’; chi-square test and Student’s t-test were used whenever appropriate. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for QFN-G in diagnosing active PTB for those with positive/negative results. ‘Indeterminate’ results were not included in the analyses. Variables with a p-value <0.10 in the univariate analyses were entered into the multivariate models as covariates. Logistic regression was performed to identify independent variables associated with confirmed active PTB. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All probabilities were two-tailed. Sample size estimation was based on earlier published data 17–19  using the PS (Power and Sample size calculation) program, version 2.1.31 (power 0.8, alpha 0.05, active-PTB/non-PTB ratio 1:2). Statistical analysis was performed using the PASW Statistics software, version 17.0.  ",0
3079,S0198885910000807,IFNG +874T/A polymorphism and cytokine plasma levels are associated with susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and clinical manifestation of tuberculosis," 2 Subjects and methods  2.1 Patients A total of 162 individuals (92 males and 70 females) infected with M. tuberculosis, residents in the State of Para, Brazil, attending HUJBB during the period 2006–2007, were selected after confirmation of infection (X-ray, sputum smear, specific culture of bronchial lavage, and positive biopsy results for M. tuberculosis). All patients were formerly included in the present at the point of admission for treatment. Blood collection was performed at the beginning or shortly after treatment was started. Subjects were grouped according to the clinical presentation, such as pulmonary (n = 129) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (n = 33). HIV-1 seropositive patients were excluded from this study. Clinical data were obtained from the patients' medical records.   2.2 Control group A control group of 156 blood samples (58 males and 98 females) were collected from individuals residents in Belem, Para State, Brazil. All subjects were health care professionals who are working at the HUJBB, were negative for tuberculosis and seronegative for HIV-1. The subjects undergo periodic examinations (including X-ray of the chest, sputum smear, hemogram, VDRL, urine routine, fasting plasma glucose and tuberculin skin test) each semester, by the Occupational Health Service of the Hospital. All participants of this group showed BCG vaccination scar.   2.3 Blood collection Blood samples were collected in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as anticoagulant and then sent to the Virus Laboratory of the Institute for Biological Sciences, Federal University of Para, Brazil. Plasma samples and leukocytes were separated and frozen at ?20°C until the time of use.   2.4 Ethical aspects All the individuals were briefed about the study and signed an informed consent form before sample collection. The present study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the Institute for Health Sciences, Federal University of Para, under protocol no. 099/07 CEP-ICS/UFPA.   2.5 Determination of the IFNG +874T/A polymorphism DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, using the phenol-chloroform method. The polymorphism in position +874 of the INFG gene was investigated by allele-specific oligonucleotide?polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR). Amplification was performed in a final volume of 30 ?l containing 500 ng of total DNA extracted, 0.2 ?mol/l of each dNTP, 5 pmol/?l of each primer, MgCl2 2.0, 50 mmol/l KCl, Tris-HCl pH 8.3 10 mmol/l, and 1.0 U of Taq DNA polymerase. The primers used were INF-? (+874) CP: 5?-TCA ACA AAG CTG ATA CTC CA-3?; INF-? (+874) T: 5?-TTC TTA CAA CAC AAA ATC AAA TCT-3? or INF-? (+874) A: 5?-TTC TTA CAA CAC AAA ATC AAA TCA-3?, which amplify a segment of 262 bp [18]. The amplification reaction was performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95°C, 30 cycles of 40 seconds at 94°C (denaturation), 40 seconds at 56°C (hybridization), 50 seconds to 72°C (extension), and a final extension of 5 minutes at 72°C. Interpretation of results was determined by the presence or absence of amplified product. The amplification products were visualized after electrophoresis (100 V/45 minutes) in agarose gel at 2% in 1 TAE buffer (40× TAE stock?TrisBase 1.6 mol/l, Na acetate 0.8 mol/l and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ?Na2 40 mM/1000 ml deionized water) containing 5 ?l of ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml), using transillumination with a source of ultraviolet light.   2.6 Quantification of IFN-? Quantification of IFN-? plasma levels in patients (n = 162) and controls (n = 150) was performed using an enzyme immunoassay kit (EASIA IFN-?, BioSource Europe SA, Nivelles, Belgium), and followed manufacturer's instructions.   2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed by the BioEstat 5.0 software [19]. The genotypic and allelic frequencies observed in patient and control groups were calculated by direct counting. The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and the comparison of genotype and allelic frequencies between the groups were performed by ?2 test using the program Tools for Population Genetic Analysis (TFPGA) 1.3v [20]. The associations between the allelic/genotype frequencies and the clinical forms of the tuberculosis, as well as the odds ratio for the susceptibility to infection, were obtained by the ?2 test. A nonparametric Mann–Whitney test was used to assess the correlation between IFN-? plasma concentrations with the clinical forms of tuberculosis and genotypes. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  ",0
3168,S0953620504000846,Obstructive jaundice and hematemesis: two cases with unusual presentations of intra-abdominal tuberculosis," 2 Case reports  2.1 Patient A A 42-year-old Moroccan man presented with a 1-month history of abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, weight loss and slowly developing jaundice. On examination, he was jaundiced but did not appear very ill. The epigastric region was tender to palpation but no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was found. Laboratory results reflected cholestasis. Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts without other pathology. On a CT scan, an extensive necrotizing lymph node mass was seen surrounding the mesenteric blood vessels and compressing the common bile duct (Fig. 1A) . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) demonstrated distal obstruction of the common bile duct (Fig. 1B) and a choledochus stent was placed. CT-guided puncture of the lymph nodes revealed necrotic material only. On diagnostic laparotomy, performed on suspicion of a malignancy, multiple enlarged mesenterial and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were seen. Histological examination of a lymph node biopsy unexpectedly revealed necrotizing granulomas staining negative for acid-fast bacilli. However, no material had been sent for culture. The chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. A tuberculin skin test was positive, but the man had been vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Awaiting further diagnostic procedures, the patient was readmitted with high fever and a large amount of ascites. A CT scan showed bilateral pleural fluid, ascites and infiltration of the omentum. The ascites contained 3.0×109 leukocytes/l, mainly lymphocytes. No bacteria were seen in the ascites and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. tuberculosis complex DNA was negative. Based on the histological findings and in the absence of findings indicating malignancy, empirical treatment with isoniazide, ethambutol, rifampin, pyrazinamide and pyridoxine was started. Clinical improvement already became apparent during the ensuing weeks. Fully susceptible M. tuberculosis was isolated from the ascites. Ethambutol and pyrazinamide were stopped after 2 months of treatment; the other drugs were continued for a total duration of 9 months. At the end of treatment, the biliary stent was removed without adverse effects. After a follow-up period of 2.5 years without treatment, the patient is in a good state of health.   2.2 Patient B A 37-year-old man originating from the Philippines presented with recurrent hematemesis due to grade 4 esophageal varices for which band ligation was performed. He had no other complaints and physical examination was unremarkable, except for a BCG scar. Laboratory results included an ESR of 68 mm and moderate cholestasis. Ultrasound examination revealed a soft tissue mass encasing the hepatic artery and portal vein. The flow in the portal vein was reversed and collaterals were seen, consistent with severe portal hypertension. A chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. Histologically, material obtained by needle aspiration of the mass consisted of necrosis, with negative results of acid-fast staining. A diagnostic laparotomy was performed, revealing a caseating mass and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes highly suspect of TB. Auramine staining of biopsy specimens was negative, however, and histology of multiple biopsies only showed necrosis. After the result of a PCR for M. tuberculosis complex DNA on the biopsy was positive, treatment identical to that of patient A was started. The clinical course was uneventful and hematemesis did not recur. The cultures remained sterile, however, and without a known susceptibility pattern, treatment was continued with isoniazide, rifampin and ethambutol.  ",0
3172,S0167587797000871,A case-control study on bovine tuberculosis in the Veneto Region (Italy)," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Geographical area The Veneto Region in north eastern Italy covers 18?364 km2 and supports over 1.1 m cattle (almost 15% of the national cattle population). In the region, there are about 20?000 dairy cattle herds holding more than 400?000 head of cattle. These herds are mainly located in the densely livestock-populated area of the Po Valley, where the land is mainly dedicated to intensive cultivation (maize, soybean, sugar beet). Animals are generally stabled in separated covered units, fed with silage and compound feed. Pasturing is uncommon and is limited to the summer season in the alpine area. The beef-cattle sector is particularly important for the region with over 5000 holdings and about 700?000 fattening places contributing to 18.5% of the national beef production (ISTAT, 1991). Beef cattle are mainly imported from other European Countries or other Italian Regions, and animal movements are therefore very intense.  Table 1  and Fig. 1  show the results of the bovine tuberculosis eradication programme in the period 1990–1995. In 1993 the region was accredited as OTF.   2.2 Case definition The 27 breeding herds for which SICTT-positive reactor cattle were confirmed (at meat inspection and subsequent histopathological examination) and reliable epidemiological information for the period 1992–1995 was available (3 in 1992, 10 in 1993, 9 in 1994, 5 in 1995), were our cases. According to standard meat-inspection procedures, mandibular, parotid, retropharyngeal, bronchial, mediastinal, mesenteric, hepatic lymph nodes as well as tonsils, lungs, spleen and liver were incised. Cases represented 31.4% of the 86 breeding herds in which new incidents were officially recorded in the same period (Table 1). Due to the absence of the regional surveillance programme in 1992 and in the first half of 1993, no suitable information was available for 20 breakdowns (18 in 1992, 2 in 1993).   2.3 Controls selection A two-stage sampling was performed in 1995 to select 80 OTF control herds. In the first stage, 5 out 22 Local Health Units (LHU) of the Veneto Region were selected by means of a proportional stratified scheme, depending on the total number of breeding herds registered in each LHU. This sampling scheme was applied because the lists of herds were filed at LHU level and, at that time, no regional computerised register was available. In the second stage, in each of the 5 LHU previously selected, 16 herds were randomly drawn (using computer-generated random numbers) from the list of the OTF herds in which no reactor cattle had been reported since 1992. Because of the lack of reliable information, 6 out of the 80 selected herds were excluded from the study. The resulting study therefore was done on 27 cases and 74 controls.   2.4 Data collection Information about exposure to risk factors was taken from data routinely generated by the surveillance system. Data were collected by LHU veterinary services for 24 case herds at the time when each outbreak occurred, using a standardised form. At the Regional Epidemiology Unit, the completed questionnaires were examined and, in case of lacking or misleading information, completed by a further investigation on site. Data collection for the sampled control herds and the 3 case herds from 1992 was performed by the Regional Epidemiology Unit.   2.5 Factors included in the study Factors taken into account in the study were chosen on the basis of their epidemiological plausibility and of the local livestock characteristics. Workers' health status was not considered, because of poor data quality. Other aspects (such as nutritional factors and slurry management) taken into account in other studies (Griffin et al. 1993, 1996) were not considered, given the above described characteristics of the local dairy enterprise. Particularly, it should be considered that pasture is uncommon and anyway limited to the summer period, and that the widespread use of compound feed minimises the occurrence of nutritional deficiencies that could represent a risk factor for bovine tuberculosis (Griffin et al., 1993).  sictt reactor cattle in the last year. Previous SICTT reactors were used as indicator of the possible persistence of M. bovis.  farm enterprise. Two categories: dairy and mixed (dairy and beef together).  herd size.

Wild animals, considered as a whole, were deer, wild boars, mustelids and red foxes.  introduction of cattle. Because of the non-normality of the distribution of the number of heads introduced since the last SICTT even after both log and square-root transformations, the variable was dichotomized at the median. This variable indicates whether or not cattle from other farms, dealers, markets or other sources entered the herd since the last negative SICTT.  proximity to official outbreaks. We used the presence of one or more official outbreaks in the last year, within a radius of 1.5 km. The herds located within a range of about 3 km around case and control herds where a breakdown had been notified during the year before the last SICTT were identified. Then, the geographic co-ordinates of these holdings and of case and control herds were determined using global positioning system equipment (Global Positioning System 45 Personal Navigator, Garmin International, Lenaxa, USA). The distances between each study herd and related restricted herds were measured using the Tmapper drawing software (Tsoft, Worcester, USA).  indirect contacts with other herds. Dichotomous variable, describing whether technicians, manpower, objects (feed, manure, machinery, farm tools) and animals other than cattle were moved from other herds. Two further dichotomous variables have been considered: type of stall and use of summer mountain pasture.   2.6 Statistical analysis A two stage-analysis was applied. In the first stage, the variables were screened using ? 2 test and t-test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Two variables (SICTT reactors in the last year and proximity to official outbreaks) were not included in the analysis given their low frequency among both cases and controls (2 and 0 for SICTT reactors, 4 and 2 for proximity, respectively). In the second stage, factors that screened through (P<0.15) were evaluated using unconditional multiple logistic regression, performed by SPSS Systat, Logit module (SPSS, Chicago, USA). The goodness of fit of the models was assessed on the basis of the likelihood-ratio statistic and the Hosmer–Lemeshow statistic. Two models were built: one based on the simultaneous entry of all the variables, the other on the reduction procedure (backward stepwise, with removal based on the likelihood-ratio statistic and P<0.05). Prior to the multiple logistic regression, the correlation matrix was examined for potential collinearity among the independent variables (Dohoo et al., 1996). No variable was highly correlated (highest correlation coefficients=0.59 and 0.39, all the other coefficients were lower than 0.30).  ",0

The diagnosis of CST was based on clinical presentation; physical examination of lungs, spine, abdomen, and peripheral nervous system; radiologic findings from plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging; hematologic examination with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); pathologic examination; and present or previous history of pulmonary TB. If necessary, diagnostic aspiration was performed under ultrasound guidance, and the aspirate was sent for microbiologic examination, but this was not routinely performed because of the invasiveness of the procedure and associated complications. No patients enrolled had complete paralysis. When it was still hard to make a definite diagnosis, empirical anti-TB chemotherapy was used. Patients with severe cervical spondylosis or ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament or severely deformed cervical spine or syringomyelia were excluded. Ultrasound was used for detection of abscesses in the paraspinal region.   Procedures All patients with confirmed cases received standard chemotherapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for at least 3 months followed by 3 drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol) for 9 months. The patients were placed on bed rest with head halter traction for 1–2 weeks during chemotherapy. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) surgery group, in which anti-TB chemotherapy was given for 1–2 weeks before surgery, and 2) nonsurgery group, in which patients received chemotherapy only, combined with percutaneous needle aspiration to drain tuberculous abscess if a patient presented with dysphagia or large abscess that had possible erosion into the great vessels. Concurrent diseases in all patients were routinely controlled over time, and therapeutic targets were blood pressure <160/100 mm Hg, blood sugar <8.1 mmol/L, improved appetite, and good nutrition. The objectives of surgery were to eradicate the infection, provide immediate decompression of the spinal cord, control pain, and maintain stability of the vertebral column. All patients in the surgery group underwent either anterior or posterior radical débridement, decompression, and fusion in a single-stage procedure. In 2 patients, combined anterior and posterior approach was used because of extensive tuberculous abscess. All patients in the surgery group were prescribed an appropriate cervical brace for 2 months; a Minerva cast was prescribed for 2 months followed by a cervical brace for ?4 months for patients in the nonsurgery group. In the study by Moon et al. (11), a Minerva cast only was used for 2 months. Complete bed rest was prescribed for the nonsurgery patients for 6 weeks; patients were permitted to get up with the neck brace on only for meals or to use the toilet.   Data Extraction and Follow-Up For all patients with CST, we extracted data regarding patient demographics and clinical variables. The neurologic examination was performed with use of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score (range, 0–17) (12), which was prospectively obtained by a telephone interview or mail contact up to March 2014. Patients with neurologic impairment (JOA score <17) and who were admitted to the hospital after 1996 were included in the assessment of the predictors of neurologic recovery. Kaplan-Meier curves of the neurologic recovery rates of patients in the surgery and nonsurgery groups were generated, and the log-rank test was used to determine the difference between the 2 curves. From a clinical perspective, surgery or conservative treatment could be suitable for all 68 patients who were eligible for generating Kaplan-Meier curves. However, the patient and his or her family members made the decision whether to undergo surgery. The decision was made after a detailed explanation of the cost, complications, and possible therapeutic effects of different treatments. The primary endpoint for the follow-up study was the occurrence of complete neurologic recovery or the end of the follow-up period. Patients admitted before 1996 were excluded because 1) most of the telephone numbers and addresses of the patients before 1996 were absent in our database; 2) standard anti-TB chemotherapy regimens including isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were established in the 2 hospitals during the 1990s; and 3) the senior author (Ye X. j.) participated in the treatment of all cases after 1996, which minimized the heterogeneity in the way in which patients were treated at surgery (Figure 1 ).   Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 8.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). Multivariate Cox regression analysis of the collected clinical variables was used to detect any possible predictors of the outcome of patients with neurologic deficit. P < 0.05 was considered significant.  ",0

3326,S2212553116000042,Selection of phage-displayed human antibody fragments specific for CD1b presenting the Mycobacterium tuberculosis glycolipid Ac2," Materials and methods  Isolation of human antibody-displaying phages recognizing CD1b–Ac2SGL on CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells  Phage-displayed human antibody repertoire, bacteria, and helper phage The human single-fold scFv libraries I+J (Tomlinson I+J), Escherichia coli TG1, and KM13 helper phage were all kindly provided by the Medical Research Council (London, UK).   Ac2SGL loading on CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells Human CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells [12] were seeded in four wells of a 12-well culture plate at 106 cells/mL. A 10-?L volume of Ac2SGL (20?g/mL) was added into two wells with CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells. Cells were mixed and cultured for 4h at 37°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere in Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640) medium without glutamine and fetal bovine serum. The unloaded CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells were used for negative selection.   Phage selection on CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells loaded with Ac2SGL For negative selection, unloaded cells were harvested and washed once with cold-sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and two times with 2% skim milk (M) (Sigma, USA) in cold-sterile PBS. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 4°C at 1000g for 5min in an Eppendorf plate centrifuge. The unloaded cells were incubated for 1h at 4°C with 1013 naïve phage library particles in 2mL cold-sterile 1% M–PBS. Cells were spun down and the unbound phage-containing supernatant was used for the positive selection. The loaded cells were harvested as unloaded cells and were resuspended and incubated for 1h at 4°C with the preabsorbed unbound phage-containing supernatant. The cells were then centrifuged and unbound phages were eliminated by washing the wells three times with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 500?L of trypsin solution (Sigma, USA; 50?g/mL) and incubated for 10min at room temperature (RT). Cells were spun down and the bound phage-containing supernatant was carefully removed. Selected phages were used to infect exponentially growing E. coli TG1 cells. Infected cells were grown overnight in 2×TY agar plates containing 100?g/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose. Plates containing infected bacteria were scraped, and phage particles were rescued as previously described on a 50-mL scale [13] and used as starting material for a new selection round under the same conditions as described earlier. After four selection rounds, two negative selection rounds were conducted by adding Ac2SGL to mock THP-1 cells and unloaded CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells, respectively. Individual phage-infected colonies were picked and used to produce phagemid particles in a 96-well plate scale [12] to test their antigen recognition properties.   Phage screening Phage-containing supernatants from 96-well plates were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using cells in suspension. THP1–CD1b cells (105), loaded/unloaded with Ac2SGL in 100?L of PBS-6%–bovine serum albumin (BSA), were added to each ELISA plate well. Phage-containing supernatants (50?L) were added and incubated (1h at 4°C). After two washes (PBS-4%–fetal calf serum [FCS]), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/anti-M13 monoclonal conjugate (GE Healthcare, UK; 100?L/1:5,000 in PBS-4%–FCS) was added and incubated (1h at 4°C). The plates were washed two times (PBS-4%–FCS) and 100?L of 3,3?,5,5?-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (Sigma) was added. The reaction was stopped by adding 100?L of 1M sulfuric acid. The absorbance (Abs) was measured at 450nm in a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Clones with Abs ratio (loaded/unloaded cells)>3 were considered positive.    Sequence analysis Plasmid DNA from all positive clones was purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN, USA) and the inserts were sequenced by Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) using specific primers complementary to the antibody fragment flanking sequences. Immunogenetic analysis of variable regions was performed using IMGT/V-QUEST (www.imgt.org/).   Recognition of CD1-Ac2SGL and lipids by phage clones Positive phage clones were rescued on a 50-mL scale and purified [13] for further evaluation.  Recognition of CD1-Ac2SGL by phage clones Microtitration ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, USA) were coated overnight at 4°C with the murine anti-CD1b monoclonal antibody (mAb) BCD1b3.1 (3?g/mL) [14] in PBS. The plates were blocked with 3% M–PBS for 1h at RT. Recombinant human CD1b loaded with Ac2SGL was then added at 5?g/mL. Lipid loading onto CD1b was performed as described by Garcia-Alles et al. [15]. After 1h of incubation at RT, three washes with PBS were carried out and 108 phage particles in 50?L of 3% M–PBS were added and incubated again at RT for 1h. After three washes, 50?L of anti-M13 mAb–HRP (1:5,000 in 3% M–PBS) was added and incubated for 1h. After three more washes, 50?L of TMB substrate solution was added and incubated for 10min at RT. The reaction was stopped by adding 1M sulfuric acid and the Abs was measured at 450nm. The ratio between the optical density (OD) reading against CD1b–Ac2SGL and unloaded CD1b was determined and a threshold of positivity of 3 was established, which is above the commonly used threshold ratio of 2 [16].    Binding of phage clones to the CD1b–Ac2SGL complex The binding capacity of phage-selected clones was determined using microtitration ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, USA) based on two methods: (a) using serial dilutions of CD1b–Ac2SGL as coating (5?g/mL to 80ng/mL) with a constant amount of phage (low-density coating ELISA) [17]; and (b) using a fixed concentration of CD1b–Ac2SGL (coating) with serial dilutions of purified phages; the lower phage concentration required to achieve 50% of maximum binding was taken as reference for the indirect estimation of relative binding capacity [18]. Both methods were performed as described in the “Recognition of CD1-Ac2SGL by phage clones” section.   Recognition of lipids by phage clones Each purified phage was tested by ELISA as follows: PolySorp plates were coated with Ac2SGL and different lipids (?-lactosylceramide, sphingomyelin, ganglioside GM1, sulfatide, disulfate sulfatide, and ?-galactosylceramide; Avanti Polar Lipid, USA) in 10?g/mL methanol and dried overnight. The plates were blocked with 3% BSA/PBS buffer for 1h at RT. Then, 108 phage particles were added. After 2h, the RT plates were washed three times with PBS. Anti-M13 mAb conjugated to HRP was added and incubated at RT for 1h. After six washes, substrate solution addition and Abs measurement were performed as described in the “Recognition of CD1-Ac2SGL by phage clones” section.   Production of soluble D11 (dAb?11) and evaluation of recognition of CD1b–Ac2SGL  Production of soluble D11 (dAb?11) Phagemid DNA from D11 phage clone was purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN) and was transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). A single colony was grown at 37°C in 50mL of 2×TY medium containing 2% glucose and 100?g/mL ampicillin until OD600 of cultures reached 0.6. Cells were then harvested and grown for 6h at 28°C in 50mL of 2×TY with 100?g/mL ampicillin and 1mmol/L isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After centrifugation, periplasmic extract was obtained using the osmotic shock method. In brief, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1mL of ice-cold TES buffer (0.2mol/L Tris–HCl, 0.5mmol/L EDTA, 0.5mol/L sucrose, pH 8.0) and 15mL of cold 0.2×TES was subsequently added. After incubation on ice for 30min, the suspension was centrifuged and periplasmic fraction containing the supernatant was obtained and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Periplasmic fraction from a 100-mL culture, previously equilibrated in binding buffer (BB; 50mM NaH2PO4 and 300mM NaCl), was used as the starting material for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography with Ni-Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (GE, USA). The resin was washed with BB containing 20mmol/L imidazole. The antibody fragments were eluted with BB containing 250mmol/L imidazole. The specific fraction containing soluble dAb?11 was desalted against PBS on a PD-10 column (GE, USA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration of the final sample was determined by BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.   Recognition of CD1b–Ac2SGL by dAb?11 Serial dilutions (5?g/mL to 130ng/mL) of purified soluble dAb?11 in PBS were added to a microtiter MaxiSorp ELISA plate previously coated with the CD1b–Ac2SGL complex and unloaded CD1b as described in the “Recognition of CD1-Ac2SGL by phage clones” section. After 1-h incubation at RT, the plate was washed with PBS-T and 9E10 mAb (directed to the c-myc tag) (Sigma Aldrich, USA) at 10?g/mL in PBS-3%–BSA was added for 1h at RT. After washing, an antimouse immunoglobulin G–HRP (Sigma) diluted 1:3000 in PBS-3%–BSA was added for 1h at RT. After washing, substrate solution was added and Abs measurement was carried out as described in the “Recognition of CD1-Ac2SGL by phage clones” section.   ",0

Procedures for engineering ?hoas H37Rv and its complementation with a full length hoas allele (?hoas H37Rv::hoas) were as described [12]. For ?hoas CDC1551, hoas was cloned downstream of an hsp60 promoter into pDE43-MCS via Gateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen) to yield pDE43hsp60hoas-MCS, which integrates into the attL5 site. This vector was electroporated into competent WTCDC1551 to create merodiploid WTCDC1551::hoas. This merodiploid strain was transformed with the nitrile-inducible recombineering plasmid pNIT(kan)::RecET-sacB, and colonies were selected on 7H10 agar plates with 10 ug/mL streptomycin and 15 ug/mL kanamycin. Replacement of native hoas with a hygromycin cassette was carried out by methods described in [12]. Knockout candidates (?hoas CDC1551::pGMCS-hsp60hoas) were screened for kanamycin sensitivity, implicating loss of pNIT(kan)::RecET-sacB, and native hoas deletion was confirmed by Southern blot. To test essentiality of hoas, a plasmid harboring a zeocin resistance gene, pGMZq17-0X-0X, was transformed into competent ?hoas CDC::pGMCS-hsp60hoas. ?hoas CDC1551::pGMZq17-0X-0X (here called ?hoas CDC1551) candidates were isolated on 7H10 agar with 50 ug/mL hygromycin and 25 ug/mL zeocin and further screened by immunoblot. Plasmids pDE43-MCS and pGMZq17-0X-0X were a kind gift from Dirk Schnappinger, Weill Cornell Medical College and plasmid pNIT(kan)::RecET-sacB was from Kenan Murphy and Christopher Sassetti, University of Massachusetts.   2.2 Other procedures Protocols for immunoblotting and Mtb aerosol infection of mice were as reported in [12].   2.3 Whole genome sequencing The genomes of the five strains described in this study were sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. Three of the strains were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with a read length of 54 bp, and the other two were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq with a read length of 150 bp. The machines were operated in paired end mode. All samples were prepared according to the standard Illumina genomic DNA sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Inc.). The sequencing statistics, including read-length and depth of coverage for each sample are given in Table S1. Genome sequences were assembled by a comparative method as described in [13], using published genomes for H37Rv and CDC1551 as reference sequences.  ",0

This patient had no history of having a TST performed. Additionally, the patient did not have indication to be screened for TB except for the employment physical. The TST was administered and results were read as 10 mm induration. A history was conducted by a public health nurse. The patient denied symptoms of TB at that time and contact with anyone whom she knew to have TB or symptoms of TB. A chest radiograph and sputum samples were obtained (Table 1). In February, the patient experienced dyspnea and discomfort in her left rib area. The patient was seen and evaluated by her primary care physician and admitted to a local hospital with a diagnosis of massive left pleural effusion. A left percutaneous pleural biopsy was done, which identified necrotizing granulomas and rare acid-fast bacilli (AFB). A sputum DNA probe was done and was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.

3431,S1526054207000322,Clinical manifestations of tuberculosis in children," Thoracic TB  Pulmonary TB Pulmonary parenchymal disease and associated intrathoracic adenopathy are the most common clinical manifestations of TB in children. Most have a positive tuberculin skin test (TST); however, skin test anergy is common in immunocompromised or malnourished patients. Inhalation of bacilli into a terminal airway can result in a Ghon complex, comprising the initial focus of infection, the draining lymphatic vessels and enlargement of the regional lymph nodes (Fig. 1 ). There are four potential outcomes: containment (no disease) and primary parenchymal, progressive primary and reactivation disease. Primary parenchymal disease is the most common manifestation of disease. Infants and adolescents are more likely to be symptomatic and have physical signs of lung disease (Table 2 ), whereas 5–10-year-olds can present with radiographically apparent, clinically silent disease. Radiographic findings may include segmental pneumonia (Fig. 2 ), bulging of fissures and calcifications (Fig. 3 ). Calcifications typically develop 4–6 months after initial infection. 2  Round pneumonias (Fig. 4 ) may also be seen, and segmental collapse-consolidation patterns are more common in the younger child. Poor containment of initial infection can lead to progressive primary disease with caseation and cavity formation. This is most commonly seen in three instances: young infants or immunocompromised hosts; aspiration of bacilli when lymph nodes erode into the airways (<5 years old); and adult-type cavitary disease (>10 years old). 1  Radiographic findings include cavitation (Fig. 5 ), erosion into the pleural space with the formation of bronchopleural fistulas, and rupture into pericardium (Fig. 6 ). Reactivation disease usually presents during adolescence and is most common in areas endemic for TB and in HIV-infected patients. Symptoms include weight loss, fever, productive cough, haemoptysis and night sweats. Findings on physical examination may be minimal. Radiographic findings can overlap with those seen in primary disease. 4   Intrathoracic adenopathy is the hallmark of tuberculous pulmonary disease in children. It has been noted in over 50% of children with asymptomatic TB infection as a transient phenomenon. 5  Isolated adenopathy is asymptomatic, usually diagnosed only in the context of contact investigations. The most commonly involved lymph nodes (in descending frequency) are subcarinal (Fig. 6), hilar, anterior mediastinal, precarinal and right paratracheal. 6  Symptoms generally occur when nodes cause extrinsic compression of adjacent structures (e.g. airway compression causing stridor, post-obstructive pneumonia, ball-valve effect). An abnormal radiograph has usually been the standard to differentiate infection and disease; radiographs, however, have limitations in diagnosing subtle adenopathy, and interobserver variability in detecting adenopathy is high even among experienced physicians. 7  Computed tomography (CT) of the chest has been utilised to further define the anatomy in cases where plain radiographic findings are ambiguous. Findings in children with suspected primary pulmonary TB include multiple lymph nodes in almost 90%, ‘ghost-like’ ring enhancement, and bronchial compression in up to 25% of children; calcifications have been seen in 15–20%. 6  There is, however, no role for the routine use of chest computed tomography in the asymptomatic child, as treatment regimens are based on findings from chest radiography. 1     Pleural TB Pleural effusions complicate 2–38% of cases of pulmonary TB in children. 8  Pleural TB can represent either primary or reactivation disease. In the former instance, a typically unilateral effusion develops 6–12 weeks after infection, is due to direct haematogenous invasion of the pleural space, and is followed by a hypersensitivity reaction generating a local effusion. Pleural TB is often found in the absence of pulmonary parenchymal disease. Reactivation disease associated with pleural involvement is characteristically associated with focal parenchymal disease. 9  Pleural TB more commonly occurs in adolescents and is uncommon in the preschool-aged child. Over 90% of immunocompetent, well-nourished children have a positive TST. 8  The most common symptoms are thoracic pain, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and anorexia. The findings on physical examination can mimic bacterial pneumonia, with dullness to percussion, diminished breath sounds and pyrexia. Pleural effusions are more common on the right side and are bilateral in fewer than 5% of cases. 8,9  Other radiographic features include parenchymal consolidation, bulging fissures and mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. 8   Analysis of the pleural fluid demonstrates an exudative lymphocytic effusion, with 1000–6000 white blood cells/?l, a glucose level of less than 70g/dl and protein of over 4g/dl. 8  Adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in the pleural fluid are over 40U/L in the majority of patients. Histopathological examination of pleural tissue is the most sensitive way to diagnose pleural TB. This is in part due to pleural TB being a paucibacillary disease eliciting a profound inflammatory response. Consequently, pleural fluid is rarely acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive, and cultures are positive in only 20–40% of cases. 8  The culture yield from pleural tissue is somewhat higher (40–60%). 8  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of pleural fluid has a sensitivity of approximately 75%, but when combined with elevated ADA levels, sensitivity was greater than 90% in one study. 10     Pericardial TB TB pericarditis is thought to be responsible for 4% of cases of acute pericarditis in industrialised countries and up to 69% of cases in the developing world. 11  Pericardial involvement complicates 1–2% of cases of pulmonary TB, primarily through direct extension from contiguous lymph nodes or via haematogenous spread. Four pathological stages are recognised: fibrinous neutrophilic infiltrate with early granuloma formation; lymphocytic serosanguinous effusion; caseating granulomas with pericardial thickening; and constrictive pericarditis. The latter occurs in up to 29% of children with pericardial TB. 12   One South African paediatric study found the mean age of patients with TB pericarditis to be 60 months. 12  Median symptom duration prior to presentation was 10 days. Source cases were identifiable in 40% of children, and TSTs were positive in 75% of children. 12  The most common symptoms included shortness of breath, cough, fever and weight loss. Chest pain, although a common symptom in adult disease, was seen in less than one third of children. 12  Physical examination findings included hepatomegaly and jugular venous distension (77% each), pulsus paradoxus (40%) and pericardial friction rub (18%). Tamponade physiology was more commonly noted in children (90%) than in adults (24%); however, children with tamponade presented in haemodynamic shock in only 9% of cases. 12   The most common radiographic finding in tuberculous pericarditis is cardiomegaly (91%). Pleural effusions may be found in up to 40% of cases, and pulmonary infiltrates were found in 25% of cases. 12  Adenopathy of the subcarinal lymph nodes can lead to splaying of the main-stem bronchi (see Fig. 6 above), in addition to a collapse/consolidation pattern from extrinsic airway compression. Echocardiographic findings can include effusions, thickening of the pericardium and adhesions. Right atrial and ventricular collapse during diastole is noted in patients with tamponade. The classic features of pericarditis, including T-wave inversion, dampening of QRS voltages and ST elevations, are seen in less than 25% of children. 12   Pericardiocentesis is the therapeutic and diagnostic modality of choice for patients with tamponade. Effusions are typically blood-stained, lymphocytic exudates. 11  Yields of AFB cultures have been low in children, and in adult studies, culture yields have ranged from 0% to 42%. 9  Histopathology of pericardial tissue showing caseating granulomas has a sensitivity of 87%, whereas the PCR has a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 75% on analysis of pericardial tissue. 13  An indirect method for diagnosis is measurement of the pericardial fluid ADA level; ADA levels of 35U/L or more have a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 74%, respectively, for TB pericarditis. 11  The diagnosis of pericardial TB continues to be made via a skin test, epidemiology and clinical data. Myocardial TB is exceedingly rare. Three distinct types have been described: tuberculomas of the myocardium; miliary tubercles; and a diffuse infiltrative form associated with TB pericarditis. Clinical manifestations include arrhythmias, conduction blocks, valvular insufficiency and congestive heart failure. 14  Myocardial TB remains primarily a post mortem diagnosis.  ",0
3437,S0377123717307256,RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE RENAL FAILURE – UNUSUAL PRESENTATION OF RENAL TUBERCULOSIS (A Case Report)," Case Report A 76-year-old man presented to a peripheral hospital in May 1995 with symptoms of nocturia, backache and bleeding per rectum of 3 months duration. He was operated for internal haemorrhoids. In the post operative period he developed urinary retention for which he was catheterised. Urine culture grew E. coli and he was given a course of ciprofloxacin for 10 days. Blood urea was 32 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL at this stage. Two months later he took a surgical consultation for persisting symptoms of backache, nocturia and frequency of micturition. Evaluation then revealed grade II prostatomegaly. Prostatic biopsy ruled out a prostatic carcinoma. The patient however was found to have biochemical evidence of renal failure and hence referred to our centre. On admission to our centre in July 1995, he was found to be emaciated, pale, ill looking and febrile. There was no clubbing or lymphadenopathy. His pulse was 86/min and blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. He had bilateral crepitations, left lung > right lung. Other systemic examination was within normal limits. The haemoglobin was 12.5 g/dL, total leucocyte count was 7100/cumm with 60 per cent polymorphs, 37 per cent lymphocytes, 1 per cent monocytes and 2 per cent eosinophils. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate showed 70 mm fall in 1st hour. Urinalysis revealed 1+ protein, 6-8 WBCs and 3-4 RBCs per high power field. Urine and blood cultures were sterile. Blood sugar levels were 96 mg/dL and serum creatinine ranged from 4.3 to 9.0 mg/dL. Chest radiogram PA view was normal. The patient was managed as a case of septicaemia with acute renal failure with cefotaxime, cloxacillin and amikacin in modified doses along with dialysis support. Repeat ultrasonography of the kidneys 2 weeks after admission showed multiple abscesses in both the kidneys. CT scan confirmed bilateral renal abscesses and in addition revealed bilateral psoas abscesses and destruction of first lumbar vertebra (Fig 1 ). Radiogram of thoracolumbar spine also showed destruction of first lumbar vertebra (Fig 2 ). Ultrasound guided pus aspiration was done from left kidney and psoas abscess. Pus smear was negative for acid fast bacilli and the culture was sterile. Repeat chest radiogram revealed bilateral non homogenous opacities suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient was managed as a case of disseminated tuberculosis with anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) comprising of rifampicin, isonex, pyrazinamide and ethambutol in modified doses. However, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and he died 2 weeks after ATT was started Postmortem study was not done. ",0
3451,S0277953602000485,"Tuberculosis mortality and recent childbirth: a retrospective case-control study of Gibraltarian women, 1874–1884"," Early and contemporary views on childbearing and tuberculosis The interest in the relationship between childbearing and tuberculosis mortality among women has a long history beginning with Hippocrates and Galen who “believed that pregnancy had a beneficial effect on tuberculosis” as the pressure exerted by an enlarging uterus led to the collapse of open cavities in the lungs (Snider, 1984, p. 10S). It is believed that by about the mid-19th century pregnancy came to be perceived as a deleterious influence on the progression of tubercular illness and that this perception more or less held until the introduction of effective treatment. Smith (1988, p. 163) cites the work of 1930s researchers who felt that “weak, malnourished consumptives already had a bad prognosis” and that the imposed burdens of pregnancy, the strain of labor, and the sudden fall of the diaphragm after delivery might fuel a reactivation of the disease and increase the risk of death. Snider (1984, p. 10S) adds that “rapid hormonal changes, the nutritional strains of lactation, and insufficient sleep from the time demands of a newborn infant” were all argued to increase the risk of TB activation in the first post-partum year. Anderson (1997, p. 330) notes that “in the early 1900s, women with TB were frequently treated with induced abortion to prevent the serious consequences of TB in pregnancy”, and that this view of pregnancy as adversary among tuberculous women persisted well into the 1900s. In his work examining the rise of therapeutic sterilization in the early 20th century, Lerner (1994, p. 364) argues that “the most common indications were for conditions that potentially threatened the lives of pregnant women: previous Caesarean sections, chronic nephritis, heart disease, and tuberculosis”. Furthermore, according to Lerner (1994, p. 373), physicians also tended to believe that tuberculous women gave rise to children “of poor stock”, characterized by “low vitality”, “tuberculous toxemia”, and “physiological poverty”. Concerns over the risks associated with pregnancy and tuberculosis began to diminish substantially following the advent of effective chemotherapy. Even so, in the 1950s, Rosenbach and Gangemi (1956, p. 1035) revealed that “there is still much doubt in the minds of many practicing physicians as to what advice to give to these mothers with active or inactive tuberculosis as to the desirability of pregnancy during or after an active process”. In their study based on over 30 years in a large tuberculosis clinic spanning the years 1925–1954, the authors concluded that “the progression of tuberculosis during pregnancy is a factor not of the pregnancy per se but of the tendency of the tuberculosis itself to progress” and that, furthermore, with more modern methods of treatment, “pregnancy should rarely be accompanied by any unfavorable progression of disease” (Rosenbach & Gangemi, 1956, p. 1037). In the 1970s perceptions of risk continued to advocate a cautionary approach in the management of pregnancies among Mycobacterium tuberculosis positive women, “…it seems reasonable to recommend that the condition of patients who have had tuberculosis should be carefully evaluated when pregnancy is discovered and, if any doubt exists, chemotherapy for tuberculosis should be administered, particularly toward the end of pregnancy…” (Edsall, Collins, & Gray, 1970, p. 735). While “the controversy concerning the effect of pregnancy or the post-partum period on tuberculosis has lost most of its importance with the advent of effective chemotherapy” (Starke, 1997, p. 112), studies now focus on elucidating the necessity and timing of administering antituberculous drugs and addressing any potential risks of toxicity to mother and fetus (Good, Iseman, Davidson, Lakshminarayan, & Sahn, 1981; Miller & Miller, 1996; Schaefer, Zervoudakis, Fuchs, & David, 1975; Starke, 1997). According to Diwan and Thorson (1999), the potential effects of pregnancy on tuberculosis has, by far, commanded the most enduring attention in examining risk factors for tuberculosis disease and mortality among women. This focus has reinforced “the traditional view of women as merely vectors for childbearing and caring”, while neglecting other areas of women's lives which might increase their risks of tuberculosis morbidity and mortality (Diwan & Thorson, 1999, p. 1000). Increasingly and more generally, tuberculosis is becoming perceived as a gendered disease, where understanding general risk factors moves beyond such obvious effects as pregnancy to consider the larger physiological and social/cultural realities distinguishing women and men. 2   2 See an alternate viewpoint offered by Walker and Cook (1998).  The resurgence of TB in westernized countries has led to a reevaluation of many other factors involved in the expression of this disease (DeRiemer, Chin, Schecter, & Reingold, 1998; Dolin, Raviglione, & Kochi, 1994; Elender, Bentham, & Langford, 1998; Raviglione, Sudre, & Rieder, 1993). Like any number of infectious diseases, susceptibility to TB infection and active tubercular disease is likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors (Blackwell, 1998; Bloom & Small, 1998; Mizrahi, 1997; Pospelov, Matrakshin, & Chernousova, 1996; Skamene, 1989). Environmental factors that have been associated with high rates of tuberculosis in historic populations include high population densities, substandard working conditions, and a general poverty-related dampening of the quality of life indicated by poor housing, inadequate and polluted water supplies, deficient sewerage and waste-removal systems, improper and insufficient diets, and poor education. Individually, each of these factors could contribute to increased susceptibility to infectious disease; collectively, these factors presented an open invitation to the great intruder—the bacillus M. tuberculosis. The gendered perspective on tuberculosis argues that all factors must be considered when addressing the complexities of infection, the rate of progression from infection to disease, and from disease to mortality (Diwan & Thorson, 1999; Hudelson, 1996; Mitchinson, 1991).

3460,S016758771500166X,Risk-based testing of imported animals: A case study for bovine tuberculosis in The Netherlands," 2 Material and methods A stochastic import risk model was developed in Excel (Microsoft Office 2010) and @Risk 5.7.1 (Palisade Corporation, 2010) that simulates introduction of infection into an importing country through importation of live animals. An outline of the model is given in Fig. 1 . Main output parameters of the model are (1) the number of infected animals that is imported (N inf), (2) the number of infected animals that is detected by AT (N det), and (3) the economic losses incurred by importing infected animals (loss). In the default calculations, a random sample of the imported animals is tested with one test or a combination of tests. Model calculations can be optimized to maximize N det or to minimize loss (target cells in Fig. 1). The decision parameter for optimization is the percentage of animals tested from each group of imported animals (   AT   perc  i j      , adjustable cell in Fig. 1). The constrained parameter for optimization is the total number of animals sampled (SS, constrained cell in Fig. 1), and thus indirectly the cost of testing. The model was parameterized for the introduction of bTB into The Netherlands. All EU member states (27 in 2012) but The Netherlands were included in the model as possible countries of origin. Cattle imports were divided into three groups: breeding cattle (age >2 years), production cattle (age between 2 months and 2years), and calves (age <2 months), assuming that different import risks are associated with these groups because of differences in destination farm and expected life span. Model calculations were performed separately for each EU member state (i =1, 2, ..., 26) and each cattle group (j =1–3) and results are summed where appropriate. Although two tests are currently approved in the EU for diagnosis of bTB in cattle, viz the in vivo intradermal tuberculin test (skin test) and the in vitro ?-interferon assay (?-IFN) (De la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006), we only performed model calculations for the skin test, because the ?-IFN is not economically feasible for testing imported cattle for bTB. On the European continent, the cervical single intradermal test (SIT) is most frequently applied; whereas, the UK and Ireland use the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test (De la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006). In the latter both bovine tuberculin and avian tuberculin are injected and the interpretation of the test is based on the difference in reaction to both tuberculins. In our calculations we assumed that The Netherlands would use the SICCT test for AT, because it results in less false positive reactors that might be infected with, e.g., Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis. Full response to the skin test is only obtained 3–6 weeks post-infection (De la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006; OIE, 2014a). Therefore, delaying AT to six weeks after importation was assumed to reduce the probability of missing recent bTB infections.  2.1 Model description  2.1.1 Importation of bTB-infected animals The number of bTB-infected animals that is imported by The Netherlands (N inf) is the sum of bTB-infected animals that are imported from each EU member state (i =1, 2, ..., 26) and each cattle group (j =1–3)   (   N    inf  i j     )  . In the model,    N   inf  i j       is simulated using a binomial distribution:  (1)    N   inf  i j     = B in  (    N   i j   ,  P   country i    ×  P   herd  i j     ×  P   animal  i j     ×  (  1 ?   P    det  i j      )   )     where Nij  is the number of animals imported from EU member state i and cattle group   j ,   P    country i      is the probability that bTB is present in EU member state   i ,   P    herd  i j       is the probability that an animal from EU member state i and cattle group j originates from a bTB-infected herd,    P   animal  i j       is the probability that the animal itself is bTB-infected, and    P   det  i j       is the probability that infection in animal j is detected in EU member state i when issuing the health certificate before export.    P   det  i j       depends on the sensitivity of clinical inspection and the skin test. Cattle are only skin-tested when exported by non-OTF member states and if older than six weeks. Since clinical inspection rarely results in detection of bTB-infected animals, even in the advanced stage of the infection, its sensitivity was set at zero. Therefore,    P   det  i j       is zero for OTF member states and    P   det  i j       equals the sensitivity of the skin test for non-OTF member states.   2.1.2 Detection of bTB-infected animals by additional testing The number of bTB-infected animals that is detected by AT (N det) depends on the sample of animals that is tested and the characteristics of the tests that are used. Currently, no cattle are tested for bTB after importation into The Netherlands and only a random sample of approximately 5–10% of all imported cattle is clinically inspected. This will not result in detection of bTB-infected animals, given the extremely low sensitivity of clinical inspection. AT of a sample of imported cattle with the SICCT test six weeks after importation will greatly enhance the probability of detection. In the model, the number of infected animals from EU member state i and cattle group j in the sample selected for AT   ( S  S   inf  i j     )   is simulated using a hypergeometric distribution:  (2)    SS   inf  i j     = Hyper geo  (   SS   i j   ,  N   inf  i j     ,  N  i j   )     where SS ij  is the number of animals from EU member state i and cattle group j that is included in the sample. SS ij  depends on the percentage of animals of cattle group j imported from EU member state i that is selected for AT   (  AT   perc  i j     )  . The number of infected animals from EU member state i and cattle group j in the sample that test positive   (  N   det  i j     )   is simulated using a binomial distribution:  (3)    N   det  i j     = B in  (   SS    inf  i j     , Se )     where Se is the sensitivity of the test used (here: SICCT test). N det is the sum of    N   det  i j       for all member-state – cattle group combinations. The number of non-detected bTB-infected cattle from EU member state i and cattle group j   (  N   ND  i j     )   is calculated as:  (4)    N   ND  i j     =  N   inf  i j     ?  N   det  i j          The model also takes into account that specificity of the skin test is <1 and simulates the number of false-positive diagnostic test results for cattle group j from EU member state i   (  SS  false _   pos   i j     )   using a binomial distribution:  (5)    SS   false_pos  i j     = B in  (   SS   i j   ?  SS   inf  i j     , 1 ? Sp )     where Sp is the specificity of the test used (here: SICCT test).   2.1.3 Economic consequences of importing bTB-infected cattle Importation of bTB-infected cattle always leads to economic losses, the magnitude of which depends on the type of farm by which the animal is imported. In the model calculations, a distinction was made between dairy herds and veal farms. It was assumed that all breeding cattle and 13% of production cattle is imported by dairy herds and that all calves and 87% of production cattle is imported by veal farms. These percentages are based on the ratio of male and female production cattle that is imported by The Netherlands, where we assumed that male cattle will go to veal farms and female cattle to dairy herds. If the animal is not detected by AT, the economic losses equal the expected cost of an outbreak in case the animal would be detected in a later stage, e.g., by routine surveillance at the slaughterhouse or by notification by the exporting country based on bTB-positive test results in the exporting herd. However, many bTB-infected animals will not be detected at all, because they will be slaughtered or culled before any clinical symptoms or lesions become visible, and before they get infectious and might spread the infection to herd mates. Therefore, the economic impact of an imported bTB-infected animal that is not detected by AT and that has farm type k as its destination   (  W   impact k    )  , i.e., the expected outbreak cost, is calculated as:  (6)    W   impact k    =  P   outbreak k    ×  C   outbreak k       where    P   outbreak k      is the probability that a bTB-infected animal would be detected at farm type k in a later stage and    C   outbreak k      is the average cost of a bTB outbreak at farm type k. The total impact of imported bTB-infected cattle that are not detected by AT (impact) is calculated as:  (7)   Impact =     ?   i = 1   26      (   N    ND  i 1     + 0.13 ×   N    ND  i 2     )  ×  W   impact  1     + ( 0.87 ×  N   ND  i 2     +   N    ND  i 3     ) ×   W    impact  2        where j =1 indicates breeding cattle, j =2 indicates production cattle, j =3 indicates calves, k =1 indicates dairy herds, and k =2 indicates veal farms. If the animal is detected by AT, the economic losses equal the cost of culling of the infected animal   (  C   culling k    )   and tuberculination of all cattle on the farm where the animal is detected   (  C   tuberculination k    )  . Hence, the cost of detecting a bTB-infected animal at farm type k by AT   (  W    cos t  k    )   is calculated as:  (8)    W   cost k    =  C   culling k    +  C   tuberculination k         The total cost of detecting bTB-infected cattle by AT (cost) is calculated as:  (9)   Cost =     ?   i = 1   26      (   N    det  i 1     + 0.13 ×   N    det  i 2     ) ×   W    cost  1     + ( 0.87 ×  N   det  i 2     +   N    det  i 3     ) ×   W    cost  2         where j =1 indicates breeding cattle, j =2 indicates production cattle, j =3 indicates calves, k =1 indicates dairy herds, and k =2 indicates veal farms. The overall economic losses due to importation of bTB-infected cattle (loss) are then calculated as:  (10)   Loss = impact + cost        2.1.4 Cost-effectiveness of additional testing Cost-effectiveness of AT was evaluated for two effectiveness parameters: the number of bTB-infected animals that is detected (N det) and the net economic benefit of AT (benefit). Early detection of an imported bTB-infected animal by AT means that a potential outbreak, and thus the expected outbreak cost, is avoided. This results in a reduction of the overall economic losses, and thus a net economic benefit in comparison to the scenario in which no AT is performed if the expected outbreak cost   (  W   impact k    )   is higher than the cost of culling and tuberculination   (  W   cost k    )  . The net benefit of detecting bTB-infected cattle by AT (benefit) is calculated as:  (11)   Benefit =     ?   i = 1   26    (   N    det  i 1     + 0.13 ×   N    det  i 2     )    ×  (   W    imapct  1     ?  W   cost  1     )  +  ( 0.87 ×   N    det  i 2     +   N    det  i 3     )  ×  (   W    impact  2     ?  W   cost  2     )     where j =1 indicates breeding cattle, j =2 indicates production cattle, j =3 indicates calves, k =1 indicates dairy herds, and k =2 indicates veal farms. Both effectiveness parameters equal zero if no AT is performed, as is currently the case in The Netherlands. They thus express the effectiveness of AT in comparison to the current situation. The cost of AT was expressed by the total number of tests performed (T), which is calculated as the sum of the total number of animals tested (SS) plus the total number of animals that tested positive (N det +SSfalse_pos), since these need to be retested to exclude false positive test results.   2.1.5 Optimization of additional testing In the default calculations a random sample of all imported animals, equally distributed over EU member states and cattle groups, is tested based on a predefined percentage (ATperc). The performance of AT can be improved without increasing the total sample size (SS), and thus the resources used for AT, by applying risk-based testing. The optimal sample size for each EU member state – cattle group combination (SS ij ) depends on the ultimate goal of AT. In our study, we defined two goals: (1) to maximize N det and (2) to minimize loss. Both parameters were set as target cells for optimization in the model. The percentages of animals imported from each EU member state i and each cattle group j that are tested   (  AT   perc  i j     )   are the adjustable cells in the optimization process and their values can vary between 0 and 100. SS ij  is then calculated as:  (12)    SS  i j   =  AT   perc  i j     ×  N  i j        The overall number of animals tested (SS) is the constrained cell in the model calculations and is calculated as:  (13)   SS =     ?   i = 1   26          ?   j = 1   3        SS   i j          The value of SS should be equal to or lower than the predefined maximum number of animals tested (SSmax, which is the constrained cell in the model) which is calculated as:  (14)    SS   max    =  AT perc  × N      Optimization of model calculations was done manually. For the optimization of N det, model results were sorted based on    N   inf  i j       in the default scenario. For the optimization of loss, model results were sorted based on benefit ij  in the hypothetical scenario that all infected animals would be detected.    AT   perc  i j       was set to 100% for those EU member state – cattle group combinations that had the highest values for these parameters, until SSmax was reached. The    AT   perc  i j       of the last EU member state – cattle group combination that could be sampled was always <100% and defined by trial and error. For all remaining EU member state – cattle group combinations    AT   perc  i j       was set to zero. Then, model calculations were performed using the new    AT   perc  i j       values. Model outcome of the optimized scenarios was checked to ensure that SS ? SSmax (average values).    2.2 Input parameters Main input into the risk model are cattle import figures for The Netherlands, bTB prevalence data for EU member states, test characteristics of the skin test and economic parameters to estimate the economic losses of importing bTB-infected cattle.  2.2.1 Cattle importation data Trade records of the Dutch Identification and Registration system for cattle from the period 2008 to 2012 were used to estimate the number of cattle imported into The Netherlands from each EU member state. In the model calculations, a pert distribution was used to simulate Nij , with the minimum, average and maximum number over this 5-year period as distribution parameters. Imported cattle were subdivided into three groups: breeding cattle (age >2year), production cattle (age between 2 months and 2years), and calves (age <2 months). Cattle imported for slaughter were not included in the model calculations, because these do not contribute to the risk of initiating new bTB outbreaks in The Netherlands. AT of these animals is therefore not meaningful. An overview of the average values of Nij  is given in Fig. 2 . Only member states that exported cattle to The Netherlands in the period 2008–2012 were included in the figure. In this period, no cattle destined for life were imported from Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, and Slovenia. From Finland, Malta, Portugal, and Sweden very few cattle were imported (?5 in total in the period 2008–2012). Import data for calves from the UK were based on the period 2009–2012 only, because in 2009 the Dutch veal calf sector voluntarily decided to ban imports of calves from the UK resulting in a huge decline of numbers imported.   2.2.2 Prevalence data Three parameters were used to estimate the probability that an animal selected for export is bTB-infected: (1) the probability that bTB is present in the EU member state from which the animal originates   (  P   country i    )  , (2) the probability that the animal originates from a bTB-infected herd   (  P   herd  i j     )  , and (3) the probability that the animal is bTB-infected itself   (  P   animal  i j     )  . No data were available to distinguish between cattle groups in estimating    P   herd  i j       and    P   animal  i j      . Therefore, the same values were used for breeding cattle, production cattle and calves.     P   country i      was set to 1 for non-OTF member states (CEC, 2003). For OTF member states,    P   country i      was based on the bTB-outbreak history as given by the world animal health information database (WAHID) Interface of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for the period 2005–2012 (OIE, 2014b) and simulated using a Beta (s +1, n ? s +1) distribution where s is the number of years in which bTB was notified to the OIE and n =the total number of years in the period that was evaluated (for most EU member states 8years were evaluated). To estimate    P   herd  i j       data on the number of bTB-infected herds and the total number of cattle herds in each EU member state were used. The number of bTB-infected herds was based on data provided by the OIE (OIE, 2014b), the EU (EC, 2011a,b, 2012, 2013), and national reports if available (FAVV-AFSCA, 2012; FLI, 2013). If these sources provided different numbers, the highest number of bTB outbreaks reported was used to estimate    P   herd  i j      . The number of cattle herds was based on agricultural census data of 2010 (Eurostat, 2013). In the model,    P   herd  i j       was simulated using a Beta (s +1, n – s +1) distribution where s is the average number of bTB-infected herds per year for those years that bTB was present in the EU member state and n is the total number of cattle herds in the EU member state. If OTF member states did not report any outbreaks in the period 2005–2012, the value of s was set to zero. Cattle from non-OTF member states can only be exported to The Netherlands if coming from a bTB-free herd. Therefore, the simulated value of    P   herd  i j       was corrected with a factor 0.6 for those EU member states that test all cattle herds annually to take into account that the average time till detection of an infected herd is then only six months plus six weeks (in the first six weeks of infection, the skin test will not give a positive test result yet). To estimate    P   animal  i j       data on the number of bTB-infected animals and the total number of cattle on infected premises were used, if available. Data were retrieved from the WAHID interface of the OIE (2014b), national reports (Defra, 2011; Anonymous, 2012), and a peer reviewed publication describing a bTB outbreak in Germany (Probst et al., 2011). If the within-herd prevalence could be calculated for each infected herd,    P   animal  i j       was simulated using a pert distribution with the minimum, median, and maximum observed within-herd prevalence as distribution parameters. If only aggregated data were available    P   animal  i j       was simulated using a Beta (s +1, n – s +1) distribution where s is the number of bTB-infected cattle on infected premises and n is the total number of cattle on these premises. If no data were available,    P   animal  i j       was set to 0.06 for non-OTF member states (based on average values observed in UK and Ireland) and to 0.11 for OTF member states (based on average values observed in Germany and Belgium). An overview of expected values of    P   country i    ,  P   herd  i j     , a nd  P   animal  i j       used in the model is given in Table 2 .   2.2.3 Test characteristics Sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the cervical SIT and the SICCT test were simulated using a pert distribution. Distribution parameters were derived from data given by De la Rua-Domenech et al. (2006). For the cervical SIT, Se was estimated at 0.910 (minimum 0.802; maximum 1) and Sp was estimated at 0.893 (minimum 0.755; maximum 0.968). For the SICCT test, Se was estimated at 0.909 (minimum 0.551; maximum 0.955) and Sp was estimated at 0.999 (minimum 0.940; maximum 1). We assumed that Ireland and the UK use the SICCT test when testing cattle before export and that all other non-OTF member states use the cervical SIT (De la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006). Calves are not tested before export because full response to the skin test (both cervical SIT and SICCT test) is only obtained 3–6 weeks post-infection (De la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006; OIE, 2014a). Results for AT in The Netherlands were based on the SICCT test.   2.2.4 Economic parameters Economic calculations were performed for dairy herds and veal farms separately. Values of the economic parameters used in the model are given in Table 3 . The economic cost of detecting an infected animal   (  W   cost k    )   is the sum of the cost for tuberculination of all animals on farm type k   (  C   tuberculination k    )   and the cost of culling the infected animal   (  C   culling k    )  . An average dairy herd in The Netherlands has 143 animals, of which 79 dairy cows >2 years old; whereas, an average veal farm in The Netherlands has 458 animals (CBS, 2014). This, in combination with the fact that tuberculination of calves is more time consuming than tuberculination of dairy cattle, results in a much higher value of   (  W   cost k    )   for veal farms, despite the fact that culling of a dairy cow is more expensive than culling of a calf. To calculate the economic impact of importing a bTB-infected animal that is not detected by AT    W   impact k     , the expected cost of a bTB outbreak on farm type k   (  C   outbreak k    )   is multiplied with the probability of detecting an imported bTB-infected animal on farm type k in a later stage   (  P   outbreak k    )  .    P   outbreak k      was calculated by dividing the number of bTB-infected primary herds that were detected in the past 15 years in The Netherlands (Table 1) by the expected number of bTB-infected animals imported by The Netherlands in a 15-year time period as predicted by the model. The value of    P   outbreak k      is 0.64 for dairy herds and 1.2×10?2 for veal farms.    C   outbreak k      consists of costs for screening (tuberculination of infected herd and contact herds), costs for culling of infected herds and/or animals, and organizational costs for controlling the outbreak. If the primary farm is a dairy herd, we assumed that >30% of animals of the primary herd are infected, resulting in depopulation of the entire farm (Van Roermund et al., 2003). Furthermore, we assumed that 25 contact herds are to be screened, of which two are infected and partially depopulated (Van Roermund et al., 2003). If the primary farm is a veal farm, we assumed that only two animals of the primary herd are infected and culled. Furthermore, we assumed that then only one contact herd is screened that appears not to be infected. The calculated    C   outbreak k      is much higher for dairy herds than for veal farms as is    P   outbreak k     , resulting in an approximately 200-fold higher value of    W   impact k      for dairy herds than for veal farms. The net economic benefit of detecting a bTB-infected animal by AT   (  W   benefit k    )   is the difference between the impact of non-detection   (   W    impact k    )   and the cost of detection   (  W   cost k    )  . Early detection of a bTB-infected animal that is imported by a dairy herd results in a net benefit of approximately 380k€; whereas, early detection of a bTB-infected animal that is imported by a veal farm results in a negative benefit of 3.4k€, thus increasing the overall economic losses due to importation of bTB-infected cattle.    2.3 Model calculations In the default model calculations we assumed that a random sample of 8% of imported cattle would be selected for AT for bTB six weeks after importation (ATperc =8). In this scenario (test-8), 8% of imported animals of each EU member state – cattle group combination are tested with the SICCT test. The value of 8% was arbitrarily chosen starting from the current situation in which a random sample of approximately 5–10% of all imported cattle is clinically inspected only. The results of test-8 were compared to the scenarios in which imported cattle are not tested for bTB (test-0, this is the current situation in The Netherlands), all imported cattle are tested for bTB (test-100), and two optimized scenarios in which risk-based AT was applied. In these scenarios, the percentage of imported cattle tested for each country-cattle group combination   (  AT   perc  i j     )   was optimized to either maximize N det (OPT-det) or to minimize loss (OPT-loss) under the constraint that ?8% of all imported cattle is tested. To evaluate the impact of the sample size used for AT, model calculations were also performed and optimized for ATperc =5 and ATperc =10. For each scenario that was evaluated 50,000 iterations were run with the model in @Risk. The advanced sensitivity analysis tool in @Risk was used to evaluate the impact of uncertain input parameters on model output. Values used in the sensitivity analysis are given in Table 4 .  ",0
3475,S0377123717309504,TUBERCULOSIS OF BRAIN: PRESENTING WITH RECURRENT STROKE AND INTRACRANIAL HAEMORRHAGE: A Case Report," Discussion Neurotuberculosis is always caused by secondary dissemination from a primary focus elsewhere in the body (3–5). In the CNS, tuberculosis can affect either the meninges or the brain parenchyma. CNS involvement seems to be as high as 45% in paediatric patients with tuberculosis and it also accounts for 21% of all intracranial space occupying lesions as reported by Dastur and Lalitha [5]. Fortunately the incidence also seems to be declining [5]. However, tuberculosis as a cause of stroke is a rarity as mentioned in most of the Western textbooks [10]. As far as focal neurological deficit is concerned, hemiparesis was detected in 19% of cases of tubercular meningitis (TBM) by Thomas et al [7]. The pathogenesis of this vasculopathy in TBM is considered to be the periadventitial inflammation and proliferative subintimal fibrotic lesions consequent to chronic inflammatory processes [7,8]. Possibly there also exists strangulatory effect of basal exudates which produce ischaemic softening of cerebral tissue causing sensory motor deficit [3,5]. It is more common to find involvement of middle cerebral territory than vertebrobasilar system. It is interesting to note that in most cases of cerebral arteritis and cerebral softening as described by Dastur and Lalitha [5], and by Dalai and Dalai [3], there have been some features of pulmonary tuberculosis or TBM to start with. We could not find a single report where reversible ischaemic neurological deficit was followed by recurrence of stroke or haemorrhagic event in 1½ to 2 years time, which has happened in our patient. The rapid progression of the second episode, which proved to be fatal, can only be explained by a rapidly progressive immunologic damage in an already sensitised individual. As in TBM, tuberculosis of brain parenchyma also has been attributed to an immunologic process [3,5,8,9]. Such antigen – antibody mediated Arthus-type reaction has been postulated in many clinical settings [3,5] as well as in experimental study in monkeys [9]. This case highlights the importance of tuberculosis as a possible cause of stroke-in-young in countries like ours. ",0
3479,S0720048X04000890,Radiological manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis," 2 Primary tuberculosis Primary TB is common in the pediatric age group, but in areas where the disease is not prevalent, the primary form may represent up to a quarter of adult TB cases [4], and since it is not expected, it is often misdiagnosed [5]. Few clinical symptoms are present and the disease is often asymptomatic. In HIV-infected patients with fewer than 200 CD4 cells/mm3, tuberculosis develops along a primary pattern [6]. In primary tuberculosis, the histologic features are not specific because there has been no previous contact with the tuberculosis bacillus. The bacillus enters the airways and reaches the alveoli where a usually small lung infiltrate is produced. Subsequently, the bacilli disseminate along the lymphatic system to the hilar and mediastinal nodes. The parenchyma presents infiltrates or consolidations that may affect any lung segment, though the middle and lower lobes are highly susceptible because of their greater ventilation. The consolidations are dense and homogeneous [6]. Patchy, linear or nodular infiltrates are less common [7]. The most characteristic radiological feature in primary TB is lymphadenopathy, which is observed in almost all patients [3,8]. Lymph node involvement is generally unilateral, with the hilar and paratracheal regions most often affected and less frequently the subcarinal nodes. Parenchymal consolidation is a common associated feature, but lymphadenopathy is often the only radiological finding (Fig. 1a ). Chest plain films are normal in a significant percentage of patients [9]. CT is more sensitive than plain films for the detection of lung lesions and enlarged lymph nodes. Hilar and mediastinal nodes over 2cm in size present a central hypodense area corresponding to caseation necrosis and rim enhancement after contrast medium administration (Fig. 1b). This feature suggests the diagnosis [3], but it has also been described in other processes such as lymphoma, metastasis and other infections [10,11]. Cavitations are uncommon, occurring mainly with progression of the disease. Obstructive atelectasis secondary to enlarged nodes may also be present. The lymphadenopathy usually resolves slower than the pulmonary lesions, with no residual features. The nodes decrease in size after 3 months of treatment, though in some cases a paradoxical, transitory increase in size is seen in the first period of treatment [12]. In one-third of cases, the lung infiltrates leave some kind of parenchymal scar, such as a nodule (tuberculoma), which can calcify forming the Ghon focus, or an area of fibrosis. The association of a parenchymal calcification with calcified hilar nodes is known as a Ranke complex, a finding highly indicative of prior primary TB. These lesions may contain dormant bacilli, which can develop into postprimary TB. In a limited number of cases of primary tuberculosis, the infection is not controlled and a progressive disease with multilobar involvement and cavitations may develop. ",0
3492,S2212553115000850,Radiologic manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients of intensive care units," Methods The present study was reviewed and approved by the University Review Board and Ethics Committee and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in an appropriate version of the 2000 Declaration of Helsinki. Information about the trial was given comprehensively, both orally and in written form, to the patients. All patients gave their written informed consents prior to their inclusion in the study.  Patient selection and study design In a retrospective study, all patients with a clinical and laboratory confirmed diagnosis of TB admitted to the ICU were enrolled in the study. All patients had confirmatory laboratory diagnosis of TB including three positive smears. All chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) of patients were collected and were recorded in a registry program. The patterns of parenchymal lesion, involved segments and presence of cavity, bronchiectasis and bronchogenic spread of the lesions with CT and CXR were recorded and analyzed.   Tuberculosis diagnosis Active TB was defined if: (1) patient specimens showed positive acid-fast staining, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was cultured; or (2) patient data met the definition of a clinical case of TB according to the World Health Organization (WHO). For clinical cases of TB, radiographic lesions compatible with active TB on CT scans were mandatory. Active pulmonary TB was defined as the presence of cavities, branching linear opacity, or multiple non-calcified nodules on CT scan. However, lesions that appeared mainly as calcified nodules or fibrotic bands were excluded from the diagnosis of active TB. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin.   Acid-fast smear and mycobacterial culture of sputum Samples were obtained from sputum or tracheal aspiration by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sent to the pathology lab for acid fast bacillus (AFB) (3 times). For negative results, BAL was performed for better results.   Chest radiology For CXR, posteroanterior views of the chest in full inspiration were obtained using a digital imaging system and the results were interpreted by a radiologist. For patients admitted to the ICU under mechanical ventilation, portable anterior–posterior CXRs were obtained. All lung CT scans were performed with thin-section CT scans with 1-mm collimation at 10-mm intervals without contrast through the thorax at end inspiration. The scans were reconstructed with bone algorithm without targeting. The scans were photographed with both mediastinal (window width [WW], 400 Hounsfield units; window length [WL], 30 Hounsfield units) and lung (WW, 1500; WL, ?700) windows. CT scans were assessed prospectively by two different radiologists. The observer radiologists were blinded to clinical history and chest radiographic findings except for the age and sex of the patients. The observers were also unaware that the patients were being assessed for suspicion of pulmonary TB. Radiologists recorded predominant pattern and distribution of parenchymal lesions, the presence or absence of bronchogenic spread of pulmonary abnormalities, and findings of sequelae of previous TB. Patterns of abnormalities were sub-classified as being areas of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) like bilateral infiltration, micro-nodules (<10mm in diameter), nodules (1–2cm in diameter), masses (>2cm in diameter), cavitary formation, alveolar or collapse consolidation, atelectasia, emphysematous bulla, calcified parenchymal masses, interstitial involvement, ground-glass attenuation, Parenchymal nodular infiltration, pleural effusion and thickening, pericardial effusion, prominent pulmonary artery, adenopathies and any other abnormal findings. Distribution of abnormalities was recorded to be present in each segment. Micro-nodules were further sub-classified as centrilobular (including any abnormality of the branching linear structure), acinar, miliary, or random in distribution.   Statistical analysis Statistical calculations were conducted using SPSS 18 (Chicago, IL, USA). The parametric variables were presented as mean±SD and were analyzed by student t-test or ANOVA and Pearson correlation test as appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-Square or Mann–Whitney U-test and Spearman correlation coefficients for non-parametric samples. p <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Sample size was estimated using sample size calculator software with 95% confidence interval and p <0.05. The mortality rate was estimated based on the total number of deaths in the period of patient admission to the ICU.  ",0
3530,S0736467914012189,All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma! A Case of Cavitatory Pediatric Tuberculosis," Case Report A 6-year-old local boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with 1-week history of high-grade fever and malaise. The parents reported that the child had been suffering from progressive exercise intolerance and nonproductive cough for the past few months. They also noted that he appeared to be losing weight during this interval. He had several visits to the ED with recurrent respiratory complaints. A chest radiograph done 4 months earlier was reported as normal. He was told he had a “wheezy chest” and his condition was treated as asthma exacerbation. He was prescribed regular bronchodilators as well as inhaled steroids. Because his symptoms did not improve, he also received multiple short courses of oral steroids. There was no history of associated hemoptysis, abdominal pain, or chronic diarrhea. There was no history of atopy or any other chronic medical illness. Family history was unremarkable. There was no history of recent travel to any developing country. His immunization status was up to date. On examination, he was febrile and ill-looking with respiratory distress. His body weight was below the 3rd percentile for his age. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral expiratory wheezing and rales. Preliminary blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 15,800 × 103/?L (70% neutrophilia), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 73 mm/1 h, and C-reactive protein level of 5.64 mg/dL. Other routine laboratory tests, including renal and liver function, were within the normal range for his age. A chest radiograph was obtained, which showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, right lower zone infiltrates, and a thin-walled cavity in the right middle zone (Figure 1 ). A computed tomography scan of the chest also demonstrated bilateral parenchymal infiltrates and two thin-walled cavities in both upper lungs (Figure 2 ). Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, the patient was empirically started on broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including anti-tuberculosis agents. He was subsequently intubated due to progressive respiratory failure. Later, the acid-fast bacilli smear of the gastric aspirate turned out to be positive and the culture grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. On further probing, the family admitted that the grandmother (who was a frequent visitor from an African country), had been suffering from chronic cough and unexplained weight loss. She had passed away a few weeks earlier from an unknown cause. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 2 months. He was advised to complete the course of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Screening of other family members was also recommended. ",0
3533,S0163445305001015,Efficacy and safety of linezolid in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)—a report of ten cases," Methods Ten consecutive patients with culture proven MDR-TB were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Ullevål University Hospital, Oslo, Norway in the period 1998–2002. Seven patients had pulmonary tuberculosis (four with cavities), one patient had spondylodiscitis, one had lymphoglandular disease and one patient had advanced AIDS with disseminated MDR-TB. Age ranged from 21 to 48 years with a median of 24 years. Six patients were women. All patients were of foreign origin, six from North-East Africa, two from the former Soviet-Union, one from East Asia and one from former Yugoslavia. Six patients had not previously received anti-tuberculosis treatment; two patients had been treated outside Norway while two patients had aquired MDR-TB during treatment in Norway. MDR-TB was defined as resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin. The indication for treatment with linezolid was a previous failing regimen in three patients and extensively resistant strains in additional three patients. In four patients linezolid was given as primary treatment. All patients received linezolid 600mg twice daily in various combination regimens including at least three other drugs: ethambutol, streptomycin, amikacin, capreomycin, pyrazinamide, ofloxacin, ethionamide, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clofazimin (Table 1 ). Susceptibility testing of all M. tuberculosis strains were performed both to first and second line anti-tuberculosis drugs using the BACTEC method (BACTEC, Becton Dickinson Diagnostic System, Sparks, MD). 7,8  Except for linezolid, the drug concentration measures for the second line drugs were performed as recommended by Pfyffer et al. 8  Linezolid susceptibility testing was performed at the National Jewish Medical and Research Centre, Denver, US (Dr Leonid Heifets) for five of the strains. The remaining isolates were tested by the BACTEC method in using concentrations of 1 and 4mg/l. ",0

3650,S0016510701039384,Importance of ileoscopy during colonoscopy for the early diagnosis of ileal tuberculosis: Report of two cases," Case reports  Case 1 A 48-year-old Chinese man presented with a 3-month history of epigastric pain accompanied by anorexia, constipation, and weight loss of approximately 5 kg. He was previously healthy and had no history of TB. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormality. A complete blood count and standard serum chemistries were within normal limits. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 2 mm/h (normal: <15 mm/h). Chest radiograph disclosed clear lung fields. Fecal occult blood tests were repeatedly negative. He was then referred for EGD and colonoscopy to rule out GI malignancy. EGD revealed a moderate degree of fundal gastritis, and a rapid urease test for Helicobacter pylori was positive. The entire colon, including the cecum and the ileocecal valve, appeared unremarkable at colonoscopy. Terminal ileoscopy revealed three 0.5 cm shallow ulcers with normal-appearing surrounding mucosa (Fig. 1A).  Fig. 1   A, Endoscopic view (Case 1) showing small discrete ulcer in terminal ileum. B, Photomicrograph of biopsy from ulcer (Case 1). A granuloma (arrowhead) consisting of Langhans' giant cells (asterisks) and histiocytes, scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells is present (H&E, orig. mag. ×200). C, Photomicrograph showing intracellular refractile, beaded acid-fast bacilli within Langhans' giant cells (Ziehl-Neelsen, orig. mag. ×600).    Biopsy specimens from the ulcer edges were sent for histologic examination but not for culture. Histologic examination of the specimens disclosed well-formed granulomas containing Langhans' giant cells (Fig. 1B), and Ziehl-Neelsen stain demonstrated several acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 1C). Antituberculous chemotherapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was initiated. The patient's symptoms disappeared shortly afterward. Six months after starting antituberculous treatment, the patient remained free of GI symptoms and his body weight had increased by more than 7 kg. Colonoscopy with ileoscopy at this time revealed no abnormality. Histologic examination of biopsy specimens obtained randomly from the terminal ileum disclosed only normal ileal mucosa.   Case 2 A 64-year-old Chinese man was referred from the surgical clinic for EGD and colonoscopy to screen for GI malignancy. He presented with a 4-month history of recurrent epigastric pain associated with increased frequency of bowel movements, anorexia, and weight loss. There was no significant medical history. Examination was unremarkable. Blood tests and chest radiograph were not obtained before the endoscopic examinations. EGD disclosed a moderate degree of antral gastritis and a rapid urease test for H pylori was positive. Colonoscopy was performed and the terminal ileum intubated. One 0.5-cm ulcer was noted in the terminal ileum (Fig. 2).  Fig. 2  Endoscopic view (Case 2) showing small ulcer with nodular edges in terminal ileum.    The remainder of the examination was normal. Histologic examination of biopsy specimens from the ulcer confirmed the presence of TB with well-formed granulomas containing Langhans' giant cells, and acid-fast bacilli were present on Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The biopsy specimens were not sent for bacterial culture. The patient refused to return for further treatment.  ",0
3652,S0743016700000516,"Calculating nature: the case of badgers, bovine tuberculosis and cattle"," 2 Technologies of Governmentality ‘Rationalities’ and ‘technologies’ such as statistics are central to Foucault's (1991) concept of ‘governmentality’. This notion begins with the belief that the state ‘becomes’ powerful. Rather than the state possessing pre-given powers, power is something that is built and constructed. This reading of the state therefore opens up new questions:  [The] issue of becoming takes us beyond the simple assumption that states are powerful, to another starting point, one that forces us to ask how state power is constituted and consolidated (Murdoch and Ward, 1997, p. 308).    Foucault's attention is thus shifted to the ‘activity’ of government. According to Miller and Rose (1990, p.2) Foucault suggests that liberal democracies are ‘characterised’ by a particular way of ‘thinking’ about the kinds of problems that can and should be addressed by various political authorities’. In particular, this way of thinking or ‘mentality’ involves building up a knowledge of the state's territory. Governmentalities thus draw upon an ‘ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics, that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power’ (Foucault, 1979, p. 20). Thus, ‘rather than “the State” giving rise to government, the state becomes a particular form that government has taken’ (Miller and Rose, 1990, p. 3). Governmentality therefore ‘refers to the methods employed as the state both represents and intervenes in the domains it seeks to govern, and how territorial integration is thereby achieved’ (Murdoch and Ward, 1997, p.308). This ‘ensemble of calculations’ are referred to as the ‘rationality’ or ‘art’ of government and are ‘capable of making some form of that activity thinkable and practicable both to its practitioners and to those upon whom it was practised’ (Gordon, 1991, p.3). This has become more important as the relationship between state and civil domains become more complex. Thus, in problematising the nature of government and territory, these forms of governmentality have relied upon experts and expertise to ‘[enact] assorted attempts at the calculated administration of diverse aspects of conduct’ (Rose and Miller, 1992, p.175). At the same time, expertise opens up those private realms, rendering them visible to policy makers making political intervention possible (Murdoch and Ward, 1997, p.310). Examining the rationalities of governmentality therefore exposes the ‘becoming’ of state power. It is here where statistics have become an important technology of government by allowing a precise problematisation of public/private territory. As Rose (1991, p. 676) points out:  Statistics here emerges as one of the key modalities for the production of the knowledge necessary to govern, rendering the territory to be governed into thought as a domain with its own inherent density and vitality…There can be no well-ordered political machinery or enlightened administration, they argue, without a knowledge of the state of the population, and the numbering of goods, activities, births, crimes, deaths and much else provides the material on which administrative calculation can operate.    Statistics, then, represent the beginnings of technological domination. They allow governments to see what they have and what they need to govern. They turn a qualitative world into information and render it amenable to control (Rose, 1991, p. 677) by reducing the prospect of chance (Hacking, 1990). However, the role of numbers does not stop there. Rather, numbers are used as agents of government and as actors within networks of power. At this point Foucault's governmentality is illuminated further by Latour's (see Latour, 1986; Callon, 1986; Law, 1992) Actor Network Theory (ANT). Just as in governmentality, in ANT, power is seen as an assemblage or effect of heterogeneous networks (Murdoch, 1996, 1997; Miller and Rose, 1990; Rose and Miller, 1992). As governments collect statistics to problematise their territory, so they become characterised as ‘centres of calculation’ (Latour, 1987). These statistics are important actors in these centres for they allow ‘action at a distance’ (Latour, 1986; Law, 1986). Statistics represent what Latour (1987) calls ‘inscription devices’- information which is highly mobile, stable and combinable. Thus, according to Rose and Miller (1992, p.185),  the accumulation of inscriptions in certain locales, by certain persons or groups, makes them powerful in the sense that it confers upon them the capacity to engage in certain calculations and lay claim to legitimacy for their plans and strategies because they are, in a real sense, in the know about that which they seek to govern.    The mobility of these figures therefore creates a ‘centre’, allowing government to speak for those represented in those inscriptions. These inscription devices do not just allow government to see what is out there, but they also allow these centres to set new rules, to constantly monitor and survey the territory and control the population from a distance (see Rose, 1999; Robson, 1992; Miller, 1990; Rose, 1991; Miller and Rose, 1990). Moreover, as Hacking (1990, p.2) points out, as these figures articulate norms, so they will translate people's characteristics so they conform because ‘few of us fancy being “pathological”, so “most of us” try to make ourselves normal’. Governmentality and ANT therefore show us that in modern democracies, ‘democratic power is calculated power, and numbers are intrinsic to the forms of justification that give legitimacy to political power in democracies. Democratic power is calculating power, and numbers are integral to the technologies that seek to give effect to democracy’ (Rose, 1991, p.675). By relying on technologies and rationalities, government is transformed into a calculating centre, creating networks of numbers and imposing government from a distance owing to these mobile inscription devices. Thus as Rose (1991, p. 691) points out, ‘democracy…depends upon the delicate composition of relations of number and numeracy enabling a calculated and calculating government to be exercised over the persons and events to be governed’.

3706,S1198743X14605395,Differences in the robustness of clusters involving the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains most frequently isolated from immigrant cases in Madrid," Materials and Methods  Study population  Madrid. The population of the Madrid area (comprising the city of Madrid and surrounding area) included 5 964 143 inhabitants in 2005, and there were 3197 TB cases diagnosed in the period 2004–2006. The incidence rates for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 16.9, 19.1 and 18.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, respectively. Seventy-five percent of the TB cases (2397) were culture-positive. Of the 2397 culture-positive cases diagnosed in the area of Madrid during the study period, 908 (37.9%) were immigrants and 1489 (62.1%) were autochthonous. The sample included all the culture-positive TB cases among immigrants from eight hospitals in the area during the study period (689 cases; 75.9% of the total number of culture-positive cases in immigrants) and all consecutive autochthonous cases from two hospitals (519 cases; 34.9% of the total number of culture-positive autochthonous cases). This sample was used to explore whether the genotypes prevalent in immigrants were also found in the autochthonous population.  Almería. The population covered by the study centres [health centres of the Regional Health Service (Servicio Andaluz de Salud) and the public network of mycobacteriology laboratories (Hospital de Poniente, CH Torrecárdenas and Hospital La Inmaculada)] ranged from 565 310 inhabitants in 2003 to 635 850 inhabitants in 2006 (average 598 388). The sample was composed of all patients with a microbiological diagnosis of TB during 2003–2006 [394 MTB isolates; 211 (53.6%) from immigrants and 183 (46.4%) from autochthonous cases].   Microbiological procedures Clinical specimens were processed according to standard methods and inoculated on Lowenstein–Jensen slants and also in MGIT liquid medium (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) in some of the participating centres. Testing for susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was performed according to standard methods.   Genotyping methods In Madrid, 1208 MTB isolates from the hospitals involved in the study were received for genotyping and 92.1% of the isolates (1113) were genotyped.From Almería, 394 MTB isolates were received and 90.4% (356) were genotyped. Strains were analysed by IS6110-RFLP [19]. The large clusters (involving more than three cases) in Madrid were also typed by spoligotyping [20] and MIRU-VNTR by amplifying the 15 MIRU-VNTR loci as described previously [21], with some modifications. The final reaction volume of 50 µL used contained 1 µL (1 U) of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and 2 µL of dimethyl sulphoxide for Mix1 [580 (MIRU4), 2996 (MIRU26), 802 (MIRU40)] and Mix2 [960 (MIRU10), 1644 (MIRU16), 3192 (MIRU31)] and 6 µL for Mix3 [424 (Mtub04), 577 (ETRC), 2165 (ETRA)], Mix4 [2401 (Mtub30), 3690 (Mtub39), 4156 (QUB4156)] and Mix5 [2163b (QUB11b), 1955 (Mtub21) and 4052 (QUB26)]. One µl of the PCR products was mixed with 9 µL of formamide and 0.5 µL of GeneScan 2500 ROX size standard (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). DNA fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis using ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Run parameters were created from the GeneScan36 POP4 default module, with a run voltage changed from 15 to 11 kV and run time set to 3600 s. Sizing of the PCR fragments was performed using GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems). The MIRU-type was defined after combining the results for the 15 loci in the order: MIRU4, MIRU26, MIRU40, MIRU10, MIRU16, MIRU31, Mtub04, ETRC, ETRA, Mtub30, Mtub39, QUB4156, QUB11b, Mtub21 and QUB26.   Clustering analysis Genotypic fingerprints were analysed using Bionumerics 4.6 (Applied Maths, St Martens-Latem, Belgium). Dendrograms were generated using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages and the Dice coefficient for IS6110-RFLP analysis or the categorical coefficient for spoligotyping and MIRU-15 analysis. RFLP clusters were defined for MTB isolates sharing 100% IS6110 fingerprint similarity. In two clusters, we tolerated clustering for those isolates that differed only in a low molecular weight band (<1.10 kb) and showed high similarity (>93%) with the representative RFLP type. This decision was supported by the findings of previous studies [22,23]. Identical spoligotypes were required in addition to identical RFLP types for isolates with ?5 IS6110 copies. MIRU-15 clusters were defined when two or more isolates had identical MIRU types and variations in only one repetition at a single locus were tolerated. Families defined by spoligotyping were identified using the representative patterns from the SpolDB4 database [24].   Gradient of epidemiological certainty of large clusters Large clusters in the study population of Madrid were categorized according to their expected epidemiologically informative value. For this purpose, we (i) compared the genotypes involved in clusters in a study in Madrid with the fingerprint data obtained from an unrelated population to try to identify fingerprint patterns that were prevalent in different settings and therefore not always indicators of recent transmission chains and (ii) checked the robustness of the RFLP clusters by applying a high discriminatory genotyping tool: MIRU-VNTR. Almería was the city selected as an unrelated population. Almería (Southeastern Spain) is 563 km from Madrid. There are only five other cities in Spain for which the distance from Madrid is greater than that of Almería. From an administrative point of view, Almería is part of an autonomous community different to Madrid. The expected epidemiological value of the clusters was defined as: 						  1. High: when the isolates clustered by RFLP were genetically homogeneous by MIRU-15 and the representative RFLP type was not found in the unrelated population (Almería).   2. Intermediate: when at least half the isolates clustered by RFLP were genetically homogeneous by MIRU-15 or the representative RFLP type was found very infrequently in the unrelated population.   3. Low: when more than half of the isolates clustered by RFLP were split by MIRU-15 and/or the representative RFLP type was identified in more than one case in Almería      Latin American MTB genotype database The database, located in Instituto Malbrán (Buenos Aires, Argentina), contains RFLP types from 3180 MTB clinical isolates obtained between 1992 and 2007 from cases diagnosed in Argentina (n = 2048) and another nine Latin American countries: Bolivia (n = 16), Brazil (n = 306), Chile (n = 35), Colombia (n = 236), Cuba (n = 10), Ecuador (n = 103), Paraguay (n = 195), Peru (n = 228) and Uruguay (n = 3).   Epidemiological survey The epidemiological information was obtained from the Regional Registry of Tuberculosis in Comunidad de Madrid. For all patients, information was collected using a standardized protocol. For the analysis of cluster M6 in Almería, we applied an advanced survey as described previously [13]. Briefly, transmission of TB was investigated using two information sources: data obtained using the standard approach (based on conventional contact tracing) and those obtained by applying two interviews. The objective of the first standardized interview was to collect complete data and photographs from the patients. The second interview aimed to compile new data and to search for potential epidemiological links based on nominal/photographic recognition between the clustered cases. Geographical localization of clustered cases, when necessary, was performed by considering the household in which the case had lived for the previous 2 years. In cases with unstable households, the one that had been used for at least 3 months was included. The study was approved by the ethical committees of the involved institutions.  ",0

3806,S0956566314009713,Attomolar quantitation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by asymmetric helicase-dependent isothermal DNA-amplification and electrochemical detection," 2 Experimental section  2.1 HDA amplification The HDA primers that we employed are designed to amplify an 84bp DNA fragment from the insertion sequence IS6110 (GenBank accession no. X17348) (Motré et al., 2011). This gen is present in the MTB complex in multiple copies and is specific for tuberculosis causing bacteria. Within this sequence, the forward (52% GC) and reverse (54% GC) primers span bases 962–986 and 1020–1045, respectively; the antisense primer is labeled with biotin at the 5´-terminal. DNA templates comprising either synthetic oligonucleotides or genomic DNA from clinical isolates were amplified using the IsoAmp® II kit (BioHelix, Beverly, USA) (step 1,  Scheme 1). The reactions were carried out in an oven at 65°C using a 2-step protocol, following the operations described in Supporting information. The product of the symmetric amplification was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, using a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized through an UV transilluminator. For real-time monitoring of the amplicons the reactions were performed in the presence of Evagreen and ROX in a HT7900 real-time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems®) set to 66°C for 5s and 65°C for 115s. Fluorescence of the mixture was monitored over a period of 1h.   2.2 Quantitative analysis of amplicons The biotinylated strands in the amplicons were entrapped through biotin–streptavidin interaction onto magnetic microparticles (step 2, Scheme 1). 50µL of the amplified mixture, without any purification, were diluted to 500µL with a 5mM Tris–HCl, 1M NaCl solution and transferred to a tube containing 50µg of the streptavidin-modified magnetic particles previously washed with the same solution containing 0.005% Tween 20. After a 15min incubation at room temperature the beads were magnetically separated and washed twice with 500µL of 5mM Tris–HCl, 0.1M NaCl buffer containing 0.005% Tween 20. Then, they were re-suspended in 500µL of 5mM Tris–HCl, 0.1M NaCl containing 75nM of a 20-mer fluorescein-tagged probe complementary to an internal sequence of the amplified fragment, and incubated for 30min at room temperature (step 3, Scheme 1). After two new washing steps in casein blocking buffer (0.5% in PBS 1×), we performed the enzymatic labeling by re-suspending the microparticles in 500µL of the blocking solution containing 0.5U/mL of anti-fluorescein–POD conjugate (step 4, Scheme 1). After 10min of incubation time, the beads were washed twice with 1×PBS and re-suspended in 500µL of the same buffer. 15µL of the fully-modified beads were finally magnetically captured onto the working electrode of a screen printed cell (step 5, Scheme 1) by means of a magnet placed under it. The cell was covered with 25µL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)+H2O2 solution followed by chronoamperometric measurement of the oxidized product after 30s of enzymatic reaction using a potential pulse to 0V, and sampling the current during 60s. Initial calibration tests were performed with synthetic oligonucleotides equivalent to the HDA products, and obtained via commercial synthesis (Table S1), both as ssDNA and dsDNA. When dsDNA is measured, the desired amount of target DNA and 75nM signaling probe in 5mM Tris–HCl, 0.1M NaCl were incubated at 98°C for 5min, followed by cooling in an ice bath for another 5min before trapping the duplex onto the magnetic beads.   2.3 Preparation of clinical samples Clinical specimens were processed according to standard accepted methods. All samples, except the pleural fluid were decontaminated by the N-acetyl-l-cysteine–sodium hydroxide (NALC–NaOH) method, and concentrated by centrifugation. This step was performed using the commercial kit MycoPrep™ (Becton-Dickinson). Briefly, samples were mixed with an equal volume of NALC–NaOH solution containing 0.5M NaOH, 0.37g/L N-acetyl-l-cysteine and 0.05M trisodium citrate dihydrate. After incubation for 15min at room temperature, samples were neutralized by adding phosphate buffer and subjected to centrifugation (20min, 3000g). The sediment was resuspended in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (2mL). A small amount of the suspension was used to prepare smears for Ziehl–Neelsen staining (acid fast staining), and after microscopic observation semi-quantitative results were expressed as number of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) per field according to Centers for Disease Control/American Thoracic Society (CDC/ATS) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. 1.5mL of the same resuspended samples was employed for the culture media (both the mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) and the classical Löwenstein–Jensen media) and real time PCR analysis, RTi-PCR (Xpert® MTB/RIF, Cepheid, USA). RTi-PCR was performed according to manufacturer instructions. The remaining DNA extracts, obtained in a sonication mechanical procedure, were stocked at ?80°C and used for aHDA amplification coupled to the genomagnetic assay.  ",0

Patients were inducted into the study from January 1994 to December 1995. Sputum culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed on all patients who had clinical, radiological or sputum smear evidence of persistence or relapse of tuberculosis despite historical evidence of at least 6 months of first-line ATT. Once proved to have MDRTB as defined above, the patients were taken up for study. A detailed history including previous drug therapy and reasons for monotherapy, if any, were probed. A detailed clinical examination was performed. Baseline metabolic parameters including blood sugar levels, liver and kidney functions were carried out. HIV status was assessed by ELISA. Radiography of the chest and sputum smear and culture studies were carried out every 3 months. The patients were exhibited ATT according to culture studies. All first-line drugs to which the patient's culture showed sensitivity as well as appropriate second-line drugs were added so that the patient received at least 5 drugs initially, with one aminoglycoside included for the first 6 months. Treatment was considered successful and continued if the patient converted at 6 months and planned to be continued for 2 years from the time of conversion. A culture positive status at 6 months was considered to constitute drug failure and fresh modification with remaining drugs was to be considered. For treatment failure at a later date the same protocol was followed. Surgical options were considered for disease localized to one lobe or lung. Care was taken that single drug changes or use of 2 drugs from the same group or where cross-resistance had been documented were not exhibited. The patients were motivated, drug reactions monitored and all ATT was made available free of cost. Criteria of cure was a persistent sputum negative status by culture for a period of 2 years after conversion. ",0
4126,S2173573518300577,Primary tuberculosis of the nasal septum: The non-ulcerated form presenting as septal thickening," Discussion Primary tuberculosis of the nasal septum is one of the least common forms of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, aptly referred to as the “disappeared disease”. 1  It is seldom suspected in isolated, non-specific swelling of the septum, and remains a diagnosis of exclusion even in the endemic regions. Primary nasal (septal) tuberculosis is unusual because of the resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis through the filtering action of vibrissae, bactericidal property of nasal secretions, and the mechanical barrier due to ciliary movements. 1  Although nasal tuberculosis is mostly secondary to hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination from a primary Koch's focus in the lungs, it may also be primary due to violation of the mucosal barrier, either anatomic (direct inoculation by fingernail trauma), and/or physiologic (loss of mucociliary and lysosomal activity). Since our patient was immunocompetent and otherwise healthy without any evidence of pulmonary tubercular focus, it can be speculated that her habit of nose-picking could have led to the mucosal breach, and subsequent inoculation of the bacteria. Although septal tuberculosis is often considered the commonest form of nasal tuberculosis, 2  related literature mostly deals with lupus vulgaris where the septum is affected in contiguity, characterized by granulation, ulceration, perforation, and disfigurement of the nose, along with the typical apple-jelly nodules. 3  Both varieties can be primary or secondary, encountered in moderate-to-good immunity, 2,3  and are rarely associated with anosmia. 4  However, evidence-based data regarding the primary non-ulcerated form of nasal tuberculosis restricted within the septum is frugal. In this context, we observe two distinct clinical phenotypes of isolated septal tuberculosis: the relatively common “ulcerated” form, and the rare “non-ulcerated” form. While the “non-ulcerated” form might appear as smooth, ill-defined submucosal thickening masquerading as septal abscess or hematoma, the “ulcerated” variety is known to present with perforation and crusting. 2,5  Therefore, distinguishing the “ulcerated” form from an early lupus vulgaris without its characteristic destructive features might be challenging. On the other hand, although short of evidence at present, it might be postulated that the long-standing “non-ulcerated” form might eventually ulcerate, such that the two phenotypes remain in clinical continuum. Since the “non-ulcerated” form of isolated septal tuberculosis is seldom encountered, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in immunocompetent patients presenting with chronic non-fluctuant septal swelling. Although the diagnosis of primary septal tuberculosis might still be that of exclusion, knowledge of this seldom-encountered form is necessary to include this entity among the probable differentials. We therefore believe that the present clinical illustration would serve as a classic reference for the “non-ulcerated” form of primary, isolated septal tuberculosis that, albeit rare, is a distinct variety of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis of head and neck.

4192,S016770121300081X,Increased case finding of tuberculosis from sputum and sputum deposits after magnetic bead concentration of mycobacteria," 2 Material and methods  2.1 Investigation of TB-Beads for the concentration of mycobacteria from sputum  2.1.1 Study setting and design TB suspect patients attending Wuxi Hospital for Infectious Disease, Jiangsu, China, and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center Affiliated to Fudan University during the period May to October 2011 were included in this study. TB suspects were defined as patients with clinical suspicion with cough, sputum production and weight loss in addition to abnormal lung X-ray findings consistent with TB. Sputum specimens with at least 2.5ml volume were included in this study. If duplicate samples from the same patient satisfied the inclusion criteria, only one sample was included in the study. In total 78 samples from 156 TB suspects were included in the study. Insufficient sputum volume was the main exclusion criteria. The direct smear and smear after concentration by TB-Beads were performed blinded using coded samples and the results unblinded and compiled after reading the slides. The technicians involved in the study had more than five years of TB microscopy experience. Ethical considerations were performed by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center Affiliated to Fudan University.   2.1.2 Laboratory testing A direct smear of about 10?l was prepared from each sample. After drying and heat fixing, the smears were stained by the standard acid fast Ziehl–Neelsen protocol and then assessed by light microscopy and scored for an acid-fast bacterial load according to the recommendations of the ATS (American Thoracic Society, 2000). The remaining sputum was then decontaminated and thinned by treating with an equal volume of 2% sodium hydroxide, 0.5% NALC for 15min. After thinning, 1ml of each sputum sample was extracted by the TB-Bead protocol, as described in the next section. In order to confirm smear positive results, if either the direct smear or TB-Bead extracted sample were positive by microscopy, the remaining thinned sputum was processed for culture by centrifugation following the standard laboratory protocol.   2.1.3 TB-Bead protocol for the concentration of mycobacteria from sputum TB-Beads were obtained from Microsens Medtech Ltd, London, UK and the manufacturer's protocol was followed. Briefly, in a sputum pot an approximate equal volume of TB-Bead solution was added to the thinned sputum, mixed and left for 2min. The pots were then placed into a clamp with a magnet at the base (supplied by the manufacturer) for bead capture. After 2min, the liquid was poured off and the pot was removed from the magnet. For washing, the beads were resuspended in a volume (approximately equivalent to the original thinned sputum volume) of 10mM (0.04% w/v) of sodium hydroxide. The pot was placed back on the magnet and the wash was poured off. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 100?l of TB-Beads Elution Buffer. For microscopy, the beads were pulled to the base of the pot using the magnetic clamp and 50?l of elute placed onto a coated microscope slide, dried and heat fixed. The slides were then stained by the standard acid fast Ziehl–Neelsen protocol and then assessed by light microscopy and scored for an acid-fast bacterial load according to the ATS (American Thoracic Society, 2000).    2.2 Investigation of TB-Beads for the concentration of mycobacteria from sputum deposits  2.2.1 Study setting and design This work was performed at the Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar as a separate study. 30 sputum deposits were used after all other tests had been performed, which included the analysis of 50?l of deposit by auramine acid-fast staining and fluorescent microscopy. Only smear negative deposits were selected for inclusion in the study as any smear positive samples undergo extensive testing and no deposit is left for additional testing. The 30 smear negative deposits were those that had at least 1ml of deposit and were randomly chosen from sputum processed between 4th and 30th October 2011. To accurately quantitate the numbers of mycobacteria, the numbers of acid-fast bacteria per 20 fields using a 40× objective for auramine staining and in 100 fields using a 100× objective for ZN staining were counted. The microscopist performing the observation had more than 2years experience of TB microscopy. The study was performed blind using coded samples. After reading and recording the results, the results from the direct smear of the deposit and the TB-Bead extract were compared. Ethical considerations were performed by the Hamad Medical Corporation.   2.2.2 TB-Bead protocol for the concentration of mycobacteria from sputum deposits A new smear test of 100?l of all the deposits included in the study was performed before extraction using the TB-beads. The extraction protocol was similar to the protocol used for sputum (see above) except that the volumes were scaled down. 0.5ml of sputum deposit in phosphate buffer was added to an equal volume of TB-Beads. The wash with 10mM NaOH was reduced to 50?l and the captured bacilli were eluted using 20?l Elution Buffer. This eluate was used to prepare a smear and was analysed by acid-fast auramine staining and fluorescent microscopy.    2.3 Data analysis Comparison of test performance was done in R with the user interface RStudio v0.96.331.

4226,S0377123717301338,PRIMARY TUBERCULOSIS OF PENISA RARE CASE," Discussion Primary tuberculosis of penis was initially described by Fournier in 1878 (cited by Lewis) [4]. The incidence of genital tuberculosis is rare. In a Japanese study done in a period of 9 years (1987 to 1995), 17 cases out of 16,363 out-patients (0.1%) were newly diagnosed to have genito-urinary tuberculosis. Five patients had genital as well as urinary tuberculosis (0.03%) while rest 12 had urinary tuberculosis [5]. Two cases amongst 40370 out-patients (0.004%) in 12 years period have been described in Indian series [6]. In our case, diagnosis of carcinoma was considered. The typical granulomata on histopathology with no evidence of malignancy of surface epithelium, helped to clinch the diagnosis of tuberculosis of penis. The diagnosis of orificial tuberculosis was not considered because of lesion being located away from urethral orifice, lack of characteristic histopathological changes and absence of AFB in sections. Tuberculosis of the penis may be of primary or secondary type depending on the absence or presence of co-existing tuberculous disease elsewhere in the body. In the present case, primary tuberculosis is believed to occur from coital contact and/or infected clothing as proposed by Narayana et al [7]. This report highlights the importance of keeping tuberculosis in mind while evaluating genital lesions. Histopathology needs to be done before embarking on definitive management. ",0
4313,S1472979211000928,DNA polymorphism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE_PGRS33 gene among clinical isolates of pediatric TB patients and its associations with clinical presentation," 2 Materials and methods  2.1  M. tuberculosis isolates, patient data, and genomic DNA The study sample comprised a total of 1 01 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates collected from 101 pediatric TB cases from Chongqing, China. These 101 isolates represent 21.9% of the 462 TB patients who were diagnosed and hospitalized in the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2008 to 2009; they included all the mycobacterial culture-confirmed TB cases among the 462 hospitalized patients. The diagnosis of pediatric TB was made following the guidelines described previously. 17  The study isolates were subcultured on Lowenstein-Jensen slants and incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 weeks. The genomic DNA of each isolate was extracted using method described previously. 18  M. tuberculosis laboratory strain H37Rv was used as a reference for DNA sequence analysis. Patient data, including gender, age and clinical characteristics, were retrieved from hospital patient charts, with patient identifiers removed. The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.   2.2 Genotyping of the study isolates The study isolates were genotyped by the 24 VNTR loci typing recommended by Supply et al. early. 19  Each PCR reaction mixture with a total volume of 20 ?l contained 2 ?L of DNA template, 2 ?l of each primer at a concentration of 10 ?M (Dingguo Bio Inc, Beijing, China), 10 ?l of 2×Taq PCR MasterMix (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), and 4 ?l double-distilled H2O. In addition, the reaction mixtures for some primer pairs were supplemented with 4% dimethylsulfoxide to improve the efficiency of the amplification. The PCR conditions used to amplify the 24 loci included: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 3min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and one cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were visualized and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel. The 100 bp DNA ladder marker (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) was used as the molecular size standards. Double-distilled water and genomic DNA of laboratory reference strain H37Rv were used as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Genotyping results were analyzed using Bionumerics software (version 6.1, Applied Maths Inc, Austin, TX). The VNTR types were analyzed as character types, similarities between VNTR types were assessed using categorical coefficients, in which all VNTR loci were weighted equally. Band tolerance level was set at 1%. Isolates with identical profiles of the 24 VNTR loci were defined as clustered isolates, and isolates with different profiles of the 24 VNTR loci were defined as unique isolates. In addition, we classified each study isolate as Beijing or non-Beijing Family isolate based on its PCR results of VNTR loci Mtub02 and Mtub30 loci, as described by Liu et al. pervioulsy. 20     2.3 PCR of the PE_PGRS33 gene The PE_PGRS33 gene was PCR amplified using the 2×GC-rich PCR MasterMix Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). Primers specific for the amplification of the PE_PGRS33 gene were selected using the BLAST program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). The primers used were the PE_PGRS33-F1 (5?-GCC GAC AAG GCG TCG TGA GA-3?) which is located at 69 bp downstream of the PE_PGRS33 gene sequence and the PE_PGRS33-R1 (5?-CCG CCG AAG TGT AAG CCG GG-3?) which is located at 128 bp upstream of the PE_PGRS33 gene sequence. M. tuberculosis H37Rv was used as a positive control and double-distilled water was used as a negative control. Each standard 50 ?l reaction mixture consisted of 25 ?l of 2×GC-rich PCR MasterMix (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), 4 ?l of each primer at a concentration of 10 ?M (Dingguo Bio Inc, Beijing, China), 6 ?l DNA solution containing 60 ng DNA template, and 11 ?l double-distilled water. The PCR protocol used for the amplification of the PE_PGRS33 gene included two phases. Phase 1 included one cycle at 97 °C for 3 min, followed by 20 cycles of denaturation at 97 °C for 30 s, annealing at variable temperatures for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2.5 min. The annealing temperature was set at 68 °C in the first cycle and then was decreased by 0.4 °C per cycle down to 60 °C. Phase 2 consisted of 15 cycles of 97 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2.5 min. PCR products were examined by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis performed in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer.   2.4 Automated DNA sequencing of PCR products of PE_PGRS33 gene The PCR products of the PE_PGRS33 gene used for DNA sequencing were purified using PCR Purification Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Kangwei Bio Inc, Beijing, China). PCR primers PE_PGRS33-F1 and PE_PGRS33-R1 were also used for the DNA sequencing of the PE_PGRS33 gene PCR products. DNA sequencing was performed in Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer (model 3730XL sequencer) at the Sequencing Center of the Chongqing Medical University. The PE_PGRS33 gene sequences of the study isolates were compared to that of strain H37Rv using the BLAST program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). All the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were confirmed by double-strand DNA sequencing using additional primer described previously. 21     2.5 Grouping of PE_PGRS33 alleles The amino acid sequence of the PE_PGRS33 protein was determined for each of PE_PGRS33 gene alleles found in the study sample. The isolates were divided into two groups (wild type vs. mutant type), based on whether or not the DNA sequence variations would cause any changes in the amino acid sequence of the PE_PGRS33 protein, in comparison with that of strain H37Rv. The wild type PE_PGRS33 group included isolates with the PE_PGRS33 gene sequence identical to that of H37Rv and isolates having only synonymous SNPs in their PE_PGRS33 gene. The mutant type PE_PGRS33 group included isolates with insertion, deletion, and/or non-synonymous SNPs in the PE_PGRS33 gene that would result in a change to the amino acid sequence of the PE_PGRS33 protein.   2.6 Classification of study subjects With the purpose of assessing the association of the M. tuberculosis PE_PGRS33 gene mutation with the capacity for the infecting organism to move distinctly beyond the original anatomic site of disease to another anatomic site outside the lung, pleural surface, and lymph nodes within and immediately adjacent to the lung, we classified the study subjects as thoracic and extra-thoracic TB, based on the criteria described previously. 16  The thoracic TB group included the patients whose disease was confined to the lungs, pleura, and/or intra-thoracic lymph nodes, while the extra-thoracic TB group contained all the patients who had extra-thoracic involvement, regardless of whether or not they had a concurrent thoracic involvement. In our study sample, all the extra-thoracic cases were TB meningitis cases. Patients with pulmonary TB were further classified into smear-positive cases and smear-negative cases based on acid fast staining of sputum/gastric fluid smear. Patients for whom the PPD skin test results were available were divided into PPD-positive and negative groups.   2.7 Statistical analysis To explore the potential role of the PE_PGRS33 gene in the pathogenesis of pediatric TB, we compared the frequency distribution of the PE_PGRS33 wild and mutant type isolates between thoracic and extra-thoracic TB (i.e. TB meningitis in the present study), between sputum/gastric fluid smear-positive and negative, and between PPD skin test positive and negative by chi-square analysis or Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate. The magnitudes of associations between the PE_PGRS33 genotypes and clinical characteristics of the disease were estimated using odds ratios and 95% confidence. Patient basic demographic characteristics (age and sex), the history of BCG vaccination, the clustering status of their isolates, and the relatedness of their isolates to the Beijing Family of M. tuberculosis were also included in the data analysis to control for the potential effect of these factors on the observed associations. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL.).  ",0
4315,S0895435603003755,"Do women with tuberculosis have a lower likelihood of getting diagnosed?: Prevalence and case detection of sputum smear positive pulmonary TB, a population-based study from Vietnam"," 2 Methods The study was carried out during April–June 2000, in the Bavi District, Ha Tay province in north-west Vietnam, where a population-based sociodemographic survey (hereafter called FilaBavi) has been set up. The population of Bavi district is 241,812. In the study base, 67 clusters out of 352 were selected by randomized stratified cluster sampling. Eleven thousand four hundres seventy-three households with 49,710 individuals were thus included in the Filabavi (Fig. 1 ). This study included all individuals aged 15 or more comprising 35,832 men and women. Potential TB cases were identified by interviewing (female interviewers) the household representative (the female senior head of family). A potential case was defined as an individual aged 15 or over who had had a cough for 3 weeks or more at the time of interview. All potential cases consented to participating and were interviewed in person using a structured questionnaire. Medically educated supervisors participated in quality checking of the data collection. One-fourth of all cases were randomly selected for a reinterview by a supervisor. Data on reported total annual income per person in the households within the study population was extracted from the FilaBavi baseline data collection, and the study population was divided into quintiles of total annual income. Health care actions taken during the current illness episode were classified as self-treatment, private practitioner, pharmacy, hospital, community health center, traditional healer, TB unit, and others. Symptoms other than cough at the point of interview were asked for in a structured question. All potential cases were asked to provide three sputum samples for TB diagnostics, and were referred to a chest x-ray examination. Individuals who could not provide sputum samples were revisited, and information on reasons why were collected. The laboratory assistant at the TB unit in Bavi is trained to examine sputum samples according to standardized routines within the NTP, and in addition, extra training sessions were provided. The samples were read and classified according to WHO guidelines [10]. All the smears were reread blindly at either the National or Provincial TB laboratory. The chest x-rays were read by the physician at the TB unit, and one researcher blindly performed a second reading. The x-ray was classified as positive if both readers classified it as suggestive of TB. The WHO case definition of pulmonary smear positive TB was used [10]. In one case, a chest x-ray was not available, and for this case the results from the sputum tests in addition to a clinical assessment by the TB doctor were used. The TB cases diagnosed within the survey were prompted to start TB treatment and followed by the NTP in Bavi. To compare TB prevalence between the screening model in the population-based survey and self-referral, records from the NTP were used together with demographic data from Filabavi and the population census in the year 2000 in the Bavi district. For the estimation of a “true” prevalence rate the cases identified in our screening survey were added to the cases identified by the NTP. Due to the small sample size of Filabavi, especially regarding self-referred/notified cases, records from the whole Bavi district were used to retrieve reported cases within the NTP (Filabavi cases excluded.). A case detection ratio was calculated by dividing the self-referral prevalence rate from Bavi district with the estimated “true” prevalence rate in Filabavi. Filabavi is considered a good representative sample of the Bavi district, and comparisons of prevalence rates between our study in Filabavi and the Bavi district could thus be done. The 30th of April 2000, was chosen as a reference date. Cases that had been diagnosed from the first of September 1999, and onwards were included as NTP TB cases, based on the established TB treatment of 8 months within the Vietnamese NTP. Data were processed and analyzed in Epi-info version 6.04 and in SPSS version 10.0. Proportions were calculated with 95% confidence intervals where appropriate. The 95% confidence interval formula for a relative risk was used to calculate confidence levels for the case detection rate ratios. The chi-square test was used to assess statistical significance. Ethical clearance was received from the local people's committee in the Bavi district, Ministry of Health, Hanoi, Vietnam, and from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. ",0
4324,S1198743X1460464X,Re-analysis of epidemiologically linked tuberculosis cases not supported by IS6110-RFLP-based genotyping," Materials and Methods  Study design and population This cross-sectional population-based study of culture-positive TB patients was conducted in nine urban districts in the south of Madrid (Spain). The total population of almost 1.5 million inhabitants receives specialized care at Hospital 12 de Octubre and Hospital Gregorio Marañón. The target population consisted of all residents diagnosed with TB from January 2002 to December 2006. Collaborative surveillance was carried out by two mycobacterial laboratories that were integrated into the TB control programme, together with other hospital medical departments, public health services, and primary health care. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from the Regional Tuberculosis Case Register using a standardized protocol. Data were recorded on patient characteristics (age, sex, country of origin, number of years of residence in Madrid or elsewhere in Spain, and district of residence), clinical characteristics (date of onset of symptoms, date of diagnosis, site of disease, and previous TB), risk factors for TB (homelessness, injection drug use, presence of HIV infection, previous imprisonment, diabetes, silicosis, gastrectomy, and malignant neoplasm), and information from follow-up and contact investigations. The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee.   Definition of microepidemic We considered an outbreak or microepidemic as the existence of one or more secondary cases arising from the same source over a 1-year period after the index case was diagnosed [11]. We preferred the term microepidemic because most of the clusters we studied included two to three cases and transmission occurred mainly between household members. In all cases, the likelihood of transmission was classified as ‘definite’ because patients were found to be in the same place at the same time, when one was infectious or a patient identified another patient as being the source of TB. This classification was made by epidemiologists before the molecular study was carried out. We used the definition of epidemiologically linked case pairs reported by Bennett et al. [10].   DNA fingerprinting DNA extraction, IS6110-RFLP typing, and spoligotyping were performed according to standard methods [12,13]. Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) was performed by amplifying the 15 MIRU-VNTR loci as described elsewhere [14]. Pairs were classified as infected by the same strain if (i) their IS6110 patterns had more than five bands and were identical or (ii) their IS6110 patterns had five or fewer bands of identical sizes and also shared identical spoligotypes. RFLP patterns were compared by computer-assisted analysis (Bionumerics 5.1 software; Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). For the pairs that did not fit the previous criteria, we applied a second-line typing approach based on spoligotyping and VNTR-MIRU with the set of 15 loci [15]. For these discrepant case pairs, we also analysed, when available, more than one sample from each patient. The second-line genotyping analysis of the pairs showing differences in their RFLP types was used to classify them as follows: (i) matched pairs, if they shared both spoligotypes and MIRU types; (ii) unmatched pairs, if they showed differences both in spoligotypes and MIRU types; and (iii) partially unmatched pairs, if they showed differences either in spoligotypes or MIRU types. Spoligotypes were considered as shared if they were identical and no variations were tolerated because of the low discriminatory power of this technique. MIRU types were considered shared if they were identical, but an allelic variation of one repetition in a single locus was tolerated.   Molecular strategy to analyse discrepant microepidemics For the microepidemics with molecular discrepancies, we evaluated different possibilities: (i) false unclustering of the cases by involvement of some laboratory cross-contamination event or laboratory error; (ii) unclustering in the cases involved in the microepidemic caused by incorrect assignment of genotypes, due to clonally complex infections (mixed or compartmentalized infections); and (iii) lack of accuracy in the genotyping analysis that could be clarified by applying second-line fingerprinting tools, and which may have considered pairs with a similar but not identical genotype as unclustered cases.

A missed case of craniovertebral junction plasmacytoma,"A thirty five year old man presented with neck pain and restricted neck movements for 9 months. Radiology revealed partial destruction of atlas and axis with prevertebral collection causing compression of the cervico-medullary junction (Fig. 1A–B). Transoral fine needle aspiration cytology was inconclusive. In view of the radiological features, ATT was started. Halo was applied to stabilize the spine externally. Two months later, the symptoms did not improve. Radiology showed additional involvement of the clivus and body of axis and C3 body (Fig. 1C–F). The angular dislocation had increased despite halo vest. The compression on cervicomedullary junction had increased as compared to the previous scan, though he had no neurological deficits. PET CT showed increased FDG uptake in the lesion without any necrosis/reduced uptake in the core (Fig. 1G). This was a pointer against tuberculosis. There was no other site of increased uptake. Transoral decompression was followed by posterior cervcio-occipital fusion. The lateral mass screws had to be inserted in C4 and C5 vertebrae as the C2-3 body and lateral masses were destroyed. Rib grafts were placed over the decorticated bone laterally to augment bony fusion (Fig. 1 H and I). The histopathology revealed plasmacytoma.

Approval of the ethical committee in KAUH was taken. The medical records were reviewed for data collection. Information about demographic data, location of TB, sputum positivity for acid fast bacilli (AFB) staining in case of pulmonary TB (PTB), presence or absence of DM, blood glucose level on admission and 2 months before, duration of hospital stay, number of relapses, resistance to antituberculosis treatment and inhospital mortality, were recorded. Inclusion criteria included adult patients aged 13 years and above who were admitted during the period of January 2002 to December 2007 with a discharge diagnosis of TB. Exclusion criteria included patients with positive HIV result, patients on steroids or immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis of PTB was based on positive AFB staining, positive culture for TB bacilli, or typical radiological findings with high clinical probability of TB 5 . For extra pulmonary TB, the diagnosis was based on histopathology of tissue specimens 5 . Patients were considered to be diabetic if they had a previous history of DM and were receiving antidiabetic therapy at the time of hospital admission or were later found to have two fasting blood glucose levels ?126mg/dL or random blood glucose level ?200mg/dL in the presence of classical symptoms of DM. Diabetic patients were considered controlled if their fasting blood glucose was <130mg/dL or peak post prandial blood glucose <180mg/dL according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association in 2009. Blood tests were done on admission and 2 months before admission. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 13.0. Chi-square test was performed to analyze the categorical variables, student's t-test was used to analyze numerical variables for group differences, p-value of 0.05 or less was considered of statistical significance.

4681,S0378113510003524,Mixed infections of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria in South African antelopes presenting with tuberculosis-like lesions," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Animals Antelope (N =139) were randomly harvested on a commercial game reserve in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. These included 121 Black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou), 12 Blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas phillipsi), 2 Blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), 2 Red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus caama) and 2 Springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis). Culling of animals was in accordance with normal harvesting practices on the reserve and done on two consecutive days in August 2009. Hunting was simultaneously performed by three different hunting parties in various areas of the reserve. Mainly female animals were targeted.   2.2 Meat inspection The jugular veins of the antelope were severed in the veldt and carcasses left to exsanguinate during transport to a nearby abattoir. Meat inspection was performed at the abattoir according to standard procedures (Anon., 2000). All visible lesions with the surrounding tissue from altogether 46 antelope were processed for histopathological examination, non-selective bacterial culture and/or mycobacterial culture. Where sufficient affected tissue was available, the sample was subdivided and subjected to all three analyses. In cases with insufficient tissue, the sample was randomly assigned to one or two of the three tests. Tissue samples destined for culture were transported on dry ice to the respective laboratories and stored at ?20°C until further processing.   2.3 Histopathological examination Thirty-four samples from one Red Hartebeest and 27 Black Wildebeest were stored in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature and transported to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa for histopathological examination. Routine histopathological processing and staining were performed on selected tissue samples according to the methods of (Bancroft and Gamble, 2007).   2.4 Non-selective bacterial culture Thirty-two tissue samples from 31 animals with gross visible lesions were subjected to non-selective culture at the Idexx Laboratories, Woodmead. The samples were cultured on blood agar containing sheep blood and MacConkey agar and incubated at 37°C. The cultures on MacConkey agar were incubated for 24h. Cultures on Blood agar were incubated under capnophilic conditions until detection of bacterial growth or for at least 6 days. Single colonies were selected and identification was performed using standard methods (Quinn et al., 1994; Holt et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2007). Four of the C. pseudotuberculosis isolates were subjected to in-depth characterization of their biochemical and metabolic properties (Quinn et al., 1994; Holt et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2007). Identification of the remaining isolates was based on the typical appearance of the colonies, haemolysis and catalase and oxidase activity.   2.5 Mycobacterial culture Forty-three tissue samples from 41 animals with gross visible lesions were subjected to mycobacterial culture at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town. Tissue samples were processed and decontaminated with 4% NaOH as described previously (Bengis et al., 1996; Warren et al., 2006). Subsequently, approximately 0.5ml of the decontaminated tissue homogenate was inoculated into BBL™ MGIT™ Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tubes containing OADC enrichment and PANTA™ antibiotic mixture (BD™) and incubated in a BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 Mycobacterial Detection System. Cultures for which bacterial growth was detected (incubation until growth detection or for at least 42 days) were subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen staining and microscopic examination.   2.6 Sequencing A selection of 11 isolates of C. pseudotuberculosis from non-selective cultures and all 11 isolates of acid-fast bacilli from mycobacterial cultures were subjected to sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial cultures were heat killed by incubation of 0.5ml of MGIT™ culture or one loopful of bacterial cells in 0.5ml of distilled water at 80°C for 1h. Two microliters of the supernatant were used for amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. PCR amplification and sequencing was done as previously described (Harmsen et al., 2003). Identification of the bacterial species was performed by screening for the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolated bacteria in the sequence databases of RIDOM (www.ridom-rdna.de; Harmsen et al., 2003) and NCBI BLAST (www.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).   2.7 Statistical analyses The chi-squared test was used to test for associations between different animal characteristics and the presence or location of lesions or the number of different organs and lymph nodes affected by lesions. The statistical analyses were performed in Stata/IC v10.1.  ",0
4686,S0378113511001040,"Maintenance, spillover and spillback transmission of bovine tuberculosis in multi-host wildlife complexes: A New Zealand case study"," 2 Defining host status The terminology and semantics of host status as it relates to transmission and maintenance of disease can be confusing. So first I will canvass some of the overlapping concepts and define terms I will use later in this review. The transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend critically on what are frequently termed reservoir or maintenance hosts. In the single-host context, these terms are often used interchangeably, and in that context these are hosts in which the pathogen persists even in the complete absence of transmission from other hosts (Thrusfeld, 1995). Probably the simplest but intuitively most useful concept for quantifying this status is the basic reproductive rate of the disease, R 0 (Roberts, 2007). For a single-host–pathogen system, this is the number of new or secondary cases of infection within the host population that are, on average, generated by a single infected animal in a totally susceptible (not previously exposed) population. Obviously, the pathogen can only persist within a population by intra-specific transmission alone if R 0 is greater than 1.0. Where R 0 is consistently less than 1.0, the disease must fade out of that population. In a multi-host context, however, it can potentially be “topped up” by inter-specific transmission from some other species that may or may not be a maintenance host. Inter-species transmission from a maintenance host to a non-maintenance host has long been called spillover transmission, and the recipients or secondary hosts as spillover hosts. Such spillover can play important roles in pathogen dynamics (Power and Mitchell, 2004).  Fenton and Pedersen (2005) define host status in terms of intra- and inter-species transmission, and derive four broad classifications for multi-host systems which they illustrate using just two hosts (or host complexes). They split the simple spillover concept above into two sub-categories, “spillover” and “apparent multi-host pathogen”, based on the rate of inter-specific spillover transmission. Where that rate is low, infection in the spillover host is transitory or occasional, and they recommend that the term spillover host be reserved for such contexts. In the extreme, where R 0 is zero or very near zero for both intra- and inter-species transmission, such spillover host species are also often referred to as dead-end hosts because they do not contribute to any form of ongoing infection. For bTB, there are probably few host species that are completely dead-end hosts, at least where there are omnivorous scavengers or carnivores and inquisitive herbivores in the mix. Even humans can pass tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) on to wildlife (Alexander et al., 2002). Where R 0 is intermediate (1> R 0 >0) or even high (R 0 >1) for inter-species transmission, but low or zero for intra-species transmission, infection occurs permanently and sometimes at very high prevalence in the non-maintenance host. Fenton and Pedersen (2005) define this case as “apparent multi-host pathogen” systems. However, I suspect that broader use of the term “spillover” as first defined above is too entrenched for this refinement to gain acceptance, so I continue to use the term spillover in the broader context. A somewhat converse context to such apparent multi-host–pathogen systems is where R 0 is intermediate (1> R 0 >0) for intra-species transmission in the second host but only occasional for transmission to other species. This is not discussed explicitly by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), but here the presence of a spillover host functions mainly to amplify the total burden of infection in the area, and the term “amplifier host” is sometimes used to reflect this role (e.g., Morris and Pfeiffer, 1995). Where transmission from a spillover host to another species is greater than zero, this may be referred to as secondary spillover. A special case of that is reciprocal secondary spillover, or “spillback”, where the transmission is from a spillover host back into the maintenance host species from which it originated. The other two host categories derived by Fenton and Pedersen (2005) are “true multi-host pathogen” systems (where there are two maintenance hosts, and inter-specific transmission is also high), and “potential emerging infectious disease” systems (where there are also two maintenance hosts present but where inter-specific transmission is very low). In the latter, one or other of the hosts may remain uninfected until a single unusual transmission event seeds an epidemic in that host. Begon (2008) provides a more detailed analysis contrasting the effects a multiplicity of maintenance hosts can have on pathogen dynamics, which include both amplification in pathogen abundance and the reverse, where the pathogen increases host mortality. In the multi-host context, the term reservoir host becomes less clear and less useful. Semantically, it is suggestive of simply being a medium- or long-term source of infection for some other species, and there may be merit in using the term to mean no more than that. Possums in New Zealand, for example, are now the source of most of the infection observed in cattle (because infected cattle are quickly detected and removed from the system, the disease cannot be maintained in cattle herds; Ryan et al., 2006). When under management, possum densities are usually reduced to below the disease threshold so they no longer have maintenance host status, but it may take several years for bTB to completely fade out of possums (Caley et al., 1999) and in that time they can continue to be a source of infection for cattle but, confusingly, not a reservoir if the term reservoir is equated strictly with maintenance host status. That confusion aside, Haydon et al. (2002) defines a reservoir as any group of species that contributes to disease persistence in a target species. A complication with that is that a so-defined reservoir for one target species (e.g., livestock) might conceivably comprise a different mix of species from that for another target (e.g., humans) even though they occur in the same place (Ashford, 2003). A simpler definition is therefore that any host complex in which disease persists indefinitely is a reservoir (Ashford, 1997). I suggest that terms such as “maintenance reservoir” or “self-sustaining reservoir” might more clearly distinguish a host complex in which the pathogen can persist from one acting simply as a short-term source of infection. There is a tendency to assign a single-host status to species as an almost fixed characteristic of the species, at least for a specified country (e.g., Table 1 in Corner, 2006). However, host status depends not only on the characteristics of the individual as a host, but also on the nature and amount or frequency of contact it has with other potentially infected individuals. Provided there is at least some density dependence in that contact structure, host status must also depend to some degree on host density. As a result, a species may be a maintenance host where it is at high density and/or transmission rates are somehow elevated by increased contact. Examples are white-tailed deer in Michigan (Hickling, 2002) and ferrets in New Zealand (Caley and Hone, 2004). A consequence of density-dependence in host status is that the maintenance–spillover distinction above is likely to blur in multi-host contexts if host densities vary widely between areas, or through time, or with management. In addition, host status can also at least theoretically be affected by changes in host density as a consequence of disease (Begon, 2008). For the rest of this paper I avoid the use of the term reservoir host, favouring maintenance host, or maintenance host complex to describe host groupings capable of maintaining the pathogen. I use spillover to describe transmission from maintenance to non-maintenance hosts, and spillback (or spill forward) for transmission from non-maintenance to maintenance hosts, but do acknowledge that what might be defined as maintenance transmission in one set of circumstances might be defined as spillover or spillback in another situation that only differs slightly in its epidemiological parameters.

4688,S019665530300720X,Contact investigation of a case of active tuberculosis,"In January 2002, the VA microbiology laboratory notified the infection control professional (ICP) of a positive acid fast bacilli smear from a bronchoscopy on a patient with diagnosed lymphoma. Because TB had not been a major consideration (or expected diagnosis), the patient had not been placed in isolation. The acid-fast bacilli test was part of a routine battery of tests performed on bronchoscopy specimens. The positive test result was unexpected. Action was immediate, and a negative pressure room was prepared for patient transfer. The ICP visited the patient to notify him of these positive results, explain the procedure for respiratory isolation, and start developing a list of contacts in case the culture proved to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis. At this time, the room was filled with visitors (approximately 6 adults and an 18-month-old child). The ICP requested that all visitors with the exception of the wife leave the room and said that she would talk with them later. The patient was given a surgical mask and was requested to wear this while the negative pressure room was being prepared. Because patient confidentiality was involved, the ICP could only take names of visitors and explain that there was the possibility that they had been exposed to a disease carried through the air and follow-up might possibly be initiated by the public health department depending on results.",0
4741,S0011848606805984,Unusual case of primary tuberculosis of the tongue," Case Report Man, 38, reported swelling of the tongue that had progressively increased over 4 months. The area was painless and not tender. The patient did not have fever, dysphagia, or dysphonia. He had smoked 20 cigarettes a day for 20 years. On the dorsum of the oral tongue to the right of the midline was a well-defined firm nodular swelling measuring 1.5 × 1 cm (Fig 1 ). The patient had no problems with moving the tongue. In addition, a right submandibular lymph node was found to be firm and mobile, measuring 2 × 1 cm. Because of the relatively short history of the mass, the strong smoking history, and the presence of a firm mass with cervical lymphadenopathy, a malignant pathology was suspected. On blood tests, only the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was abnormal, at 24 mm in the first hour. The patient also had negative results on testing for human immunodeficiency virus, and a chest radiograph was normal. Fine-needle aspiration cytology performed on the tongue mass yielded evidence of a caseating granulomatous lesion suggesting tuberculosis. Acid-fast bacilli staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were positive, confirming the diagnosis of tuberculosis. A 4-drug antitubercular treatment comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was given for 2 months, then isoniazid and rifampicin were given for 4 additional months.

Hence, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsies were obtained from the ovary, bilateral fallopian tubes, omentum and peritoneum. At laparoscopy, a total volume of 100mL canary yellow exudative ascites was aspirated and a unilateral tubo-ovarian cyst of about 5cm diameter on the right was observed. Moreover, extensive miliary deposits on the uterus, peritoneal wall, and intestines were noted (Fig. 1E–H). Accidental rupture of the cyst resulted in the drainage of approximately 50mL of chocolate-colored fluid. No endometriosis-like foci were found in other locations like the posterior cul-de-sac or contralateral adnexa. Right-sided cystectomy was performed and immediate gross examination of the cyst revealed a smooth surface without any solid tissues. Frozen sections from the resected specimen of miliary deposits revealed multiple granulomas with epithelioid cells and caseous necrosis suggestive of tuberculosis (Fig. 1C).

She had negative initial blood and sputum culture, acid fast stain and polymerase chain reaction for tuberculosis. She was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia and discharged to the LTC facility for two weeks. Sputum culture grew Mycobacterium Tuberculosis at 6 weeks.We diagnosed her as relapsed smear negative culture positive pulmonary TB. We readmitted her to the hospital for negative-pressure airborne isolation for two weeks. We treated her with four drug therapy including isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. Three acid fast smears were negative. We repeated cultures which remained positive for pan-sensitive Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. She was considered to be low risk for infection transmission given resolution of cough and absence of sputum production and completion of two weeks of anti-tubercular therapy in isolation. She was discharged to the LTC facility with direct observation therapy of antitubercular drugs by the public health department and advice to continue isolation with surgical mask. ",0

Opinions differ regarding the efficacy of contact tracing. 3,4  UK guidance further recommends that healthcare workers “inform and advise” TB contacts with a negative screen during contact tracing to seek medical care if they develop symptoms suggestive of TB disease at a later date. Whilst sensible, there are little data to support this approach. In one of the few published studies, it compared favourably with chest radiograph-based follow-up for contacts of adults with smear positive pulmonary TB. 5  The lack of other relevant data makes further information on whether “inform and advise” results in improved TB detection helpful.",0
4925,S0196439916300113,Extensively Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Kelantan East Coast of Malaysia: First Two Cases," Case Report  Case 1 A 42-year-old Malaysian nonsmoking female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM type 2) and no prior history of TB exposure presented to our emergency room with chronic cough and hemoptysis. The patient had a low-grade fever and a history of weight loss, along with complaints of lack of appetite, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. Evaluation of her gastrointestinal and urinary tracts was within normal limits. The patient received several different courses of antibiotic therapy from her general practitioner with no clinical improvement. The chest X-ray showed consolidation of the right middle and left upper and middle lung fields. Acid-fast smears of expectorated sputum showed many acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Figure 1  shows the patient's chest X-ray before the initiation of TB treatment. The patient was started on anti-TB therapy on the basis of the Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) guidelines as recommended by the WHO. Her sputum AFB smear examination converted to negative after 2 months of therapy. During her initial phase of treatment, she traveled to another area for a 1-month period, where she allegedly continued her therapy. However, when the patient returned, she presented with her pretreatment symptoms of pulmonary TB. She continued on 6 months of anti-TB treatment with no clinical improvement. Her chest X-ray showed progressive worsening of her pulmonary disease. An M. tuberculosis isolate recovered from her first sputum culture was susceptible to all first-line drugs; however, an isolate from a second sputum culture after almost 9 months of therapy was resistant to all the first-line anti-TB agents. The patient may have developed MDR-TB infection because of her uncontrolled diabetes, a history of travel with possible exposure to an infected person, and/or noncompliance with the treatment regimen. She was treated for her MDR-TB infection with several second-line drugs, including kanamycin, ethionamide, cycloserine, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide. The patient had multiple admissions, because she developed many complications that were mainly due to the side effects of the second-line drugs used for therapy. These side effects included frequent vomiting; tiredness; bilateral peripheral neuropathy; and pain in her large joints, particularly the knees. Because of severe nephro- and ototoxicities, kanamycin was discontinued, but the patient remained on her cycloserine, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide treatment regimen. Her sputum smear became AFB negative after 6 months of second-line drug therapy but then became smear positive again after 11 months of treatment, with the re-emergence of her pulmonary symptoms. After 14 months of treatment, an M. tuberculosis strain that was resistant to all first- and second-line anti-TB agents, including the fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, was isolated from the patient's sputum. The XDR-TB isolate was susceptible only to viomycin, to which it soon became resistant. Because of this, the patient was removed from all anti-TB medications and provided palliative care only. To reduce the risk of transmission to her family members and other close contacts, an air filtration system was installed in her room. The patient's condition worsened, and the chest X-ray (Fig. 2 ) showed extensive disease with multiple abscesses. This XDR-TB patient expired while on palliative treatment from multiple co-morbidities after more than 2 years of anti-TB treatment.   Case 2 A 47-year-old Chinese female with a history of DM type 2 presented to our clinic for evaluation of a productive cough of 3 months duration, weight loss, and loss of appetite. She had no hemoptysis and no history of fever or night sweats. The patient was never treated for TB and had no known history of contact with patients symptomatic for TB infection. Her chest X-ray showed a patchy opacity involving the left upper lobe, and her sputum smear was positive for AFB. The patient was started on the DOTS regimen, consisting of an intensive period of 2 months of therapy followed by a 4-month, less intensive continuation phase of treatment. Her sputum converted to negative for AFB after 2 months of therapy. After 5 months of first-line anti-TB therapy, the patient traveled outside the area for a period of 3 weeks. However, 3 weeks after she returned home, she presented to our clinic complaining of an intermittent cough productive of sputum and with hemoptysis and lack of appetite. Her sputum smear was positive for AFB. The patient was noncompliant in taking her DM type 2 medications. The M. tuberculosis strain cultured from the her sputum was now resistant to all first-line anti-TB drugs. The patient was admitted to a hospital isolation room, and second-line anti-TB therapy consisting of cycloserine, kanamycin, ethionamide, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide was initiated. After 3 months of second-line TB therapy, she developed drug-associated side effects that included tinnitus, giddiness, hearing loss, and reduced vision. The kanamycin therapy was stopped because of ototoxicity. After 2 months of treatment, the patient continued to experience nausea, vomiting, large-joint pain, and intermittent loss of appetite. Susceptibility testing of the M. tuberculosis isolate showed that it was resistant to all the aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone antibiotics tested. Following treatment failure with primary and secondary anti-TB drugs, the patient was diagnosed with XDR-TB infection. This XDR-TB infection likely resulted from poor drug compliance and her history of uncontrolled diabetes. The patient was started on an XDR-TB treatment regimen consisting of cycloserine, pyrazinamide, clopazimine, augmentin, and pyridoxine. After 1 month of therapy, her sputum smear was still positive for AFB, even though the patient showed some clinical improvement. Isoniazid was added to the treatment regimen. After 4 months, she experienced a remarkable improvement, with a return of good appetite and weight gain. She continued to show improvement, and after 18 months of XDR-TB therapy, her cough had subsided, her lungs became clear, and her AFB smear and culture examinations were negative.  ",0
4936,S0953620508001489,Persistent pyrexia post-liver transplantation: A unique case of pericardial tuberculosis," 2 Discussion Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infections affect less than 1% of solid-organ transplant recipients [1], but cumulative incidence is three times that of the general population [2]. This is the first published report of pericardial TB occurring 3 months after OLT in a Caucasian adult without a history of previous TB. Pericardial TB is unusual and accounts for only 4% of TB in the developed world [3]. It is associated with the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [4] in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with acute rejections in kidney-transplant recipients [2]. Immunosuppression and CMV infection post-OLT would have suppressed the cellular and humoral arm of the immune system and placed our patient at risk of infections. Despite presenting with classical symptoms, pericardial effusion was the only abnormal finding and the final diagnosis of TB was made after a 4-week culture of pericardial fluid on the LJ-medium. The origin of TB infection in our patient was puzzling as there were no risk factors or history of TB and the CXR was clear. Pre-operative purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) testing is currently not routinely performed in liver recipients as patients are often anergic from underlying disease [5]. In a Spanish study, 80% of patients showed a false-negative PPD result. Although donor details were unavailable, we raise the possibility of donor-transmitted (hepatic) TB [1,6], as donor-transmitted infections are increasingly recognized [6] and may explain the early development and unusual site of disease. More importantly, clinicians need to recognize that immunosuppression may lead to atypical manifestations of illnesses. TB should be considered as a cause of persistent pyrexia post-OLT, even in the absence of radiological findings or suggestive history. As both CXR and ZN-smear tests are insensitive and non-specific, a prolonged LJ-culture remains essential in the diagnosis of post-OLT TB. ",0
4947,S0277953602003738,The politics of ‘branding’ in policy transfer: the case of DOTS for tuberculosis control," Tuberculosis—a neglected problem Although TB has been a problem of public health importance for centuries, prior to the last decade it was not prominent on the international health agenda. Improved living conditions and drugs meant that TB diminished as a public health problem in most industrialised nations from the 1940s, and slipped off the list of public policy priorities in those countries. While it continued to be a major problem in developing countries, operational solutions were addressed through research in India (Fox, 1990), Hong Kong (Moodie, 1967), and the UK (Stradling & Poole, 1963), and a number of strategies for treatment and control of the disease were established. Improved anti-TB drugs, which reduced the duration of treatment from 18 to 6 months, were developed in the 1970s and added to TB programmes. However, while important strides were made in TB control—strategies which later formed the basis of DOTS—these were not widely disseminated outside a narrow scientific and technical policy community. Complacency in the industrialised world was mirrored in the WHO, which neglected TB during the 1970s and 1980s (Walt, 1999). Operational questions were left to national ministries of health, with or without the assistance of organisations such as the IUATLD—an international TB technical non-government organisation. There was very little transfer of knowledge or approach during this period, from one part of the world to another, except through the scientific exchanges of a small, technical group of TB experts. All this changed, however, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the WHO and IUATLD developed a new joint global strategy. Initially entitled ‘Framework for Effective Tuberculosis Control’ (WHO, 1994), the strategy was branded ‘DOTS’ in 1995. Once developed, DOTS was aggressively promoted by key actors in WHO and the World Bank as ‘the solution’ to TB control. DOTS was subsequently transferred from the international arena to national and local governments the world over. ",0
4987,S1201971210023842,Re: Rapid diagnosis and successful drug therapy of primary parotid tuberculosis in the pediatric age group: a case report and brief review of the literature,"A 14-year-old female presented with a progressively increasing swelling in the left parotid region of two-month duration. There was no relationship of swelling to meals. Swelling was not associated with any other symptoms. Her past history and family history was insignificant. Physical examination revealed a 3×3cm mobile, cystic, non-tender mass occupying the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. The overlying skin was normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, other biochemical investigations, and chest radiograph were normal. Ultrasound examination revealed a well-defined, unilocular, anechoic lesion with mobile internal debris involving the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-defined 3×3cm mass lesion involving the left parotid gland. The lesion was hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging with peripheral rim enhancement (Figure 1 ). An intra-parotid node was also seen involving the superficial lobe of the left gland showing peripheral rim enhancement. The differential diagnosis included parotid abscess, tuberculous parotitis, and infected branchial cyst. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the lesion stained with the Ziehl–Neelsen stain showed acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of tubercular parotid abscess was made and the patient was started on anti- tubercular drugs. A follow-up ultrasound at 6 months showed resolution of the abscess and intra-parotid node.",0
5039,S0090301903004865,Cranial-epidural tuberculosis presenting as a scalp swelling," Case reports  Case 1 A 37-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of a painful, progressive lump in the right frontal parietal region associated with local tenderness and right-sided headache. There was no history of head trauma. Examination revealed a firm swelling 3 cm in diameter, tender on palpation, and fixed to the underlying bone. Neurologic examination revealed no abnormalities. Skull X-ray showed a lytic lesion in the right frontoparietal region (Figure 1).  Brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed an enhancing extradural mass eroding the overlying bone and extending subgaleally (Figure 2).  MRI showed an enhancing extradural mass extending into the subgaleal plane through eroded bone. The dura mater underlying the mass showed thickening and enhancement (Figure 3).   Biopsy of this skull lesion showed inflammatory granuloma composed mostly of plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, epithelioid cells, and giant cells, consistent with tubercular granuloma. A Mantoux test carried out after biopsy was strongly positive and Erythrocite Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was elevated. Anti-TB therapy resulted in gradual regression of the lesion and resolution of local pain and headache.   Case 2 A 24-year-old man presented with a three-month history of frontal headaches and an increasing scalp swelling in the right frontal region. Examination revealed a firm swelling, 3.5 cm in diameter, mildly tender and fixed to the underlying skull. No neurologic deficit could be elicited. A Mantoux test was strongly positive and ESR was elevated (120 mm/1st hour). A skull X-ray showed a small lytic lesion of the skull at the site of the swelling. A CT scan showed skull erosion under the scalp swelling. An MRI (Figure 4  A, B) showed an enhancing extradural lesion extending into the subgaleal mass through the eroded skull. A needle biopsy of the subgaleal swelling revealed tubercular granulation tissue and scanty pus. Tubercle bacilli were isolated and grown in culture from the lesion. Antitubercular chemotherapy, consisting of isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampicin (600 mg/day), ethambutol (1200 mg/day), and pyrazinamide (1500 mg/day), was started. Follow-up three months later showed complete resolution of the headache and the lesion.  ",0

5189,S0149718910000157,Evaluation of program performance and expenditures in a report of performance measures (RPM) via a case study of two Florida county tuberculosis programs," 2 Background  2.1 Benchmarking and the use of the RPM Benchmarking generally refers to the process of a business entity gathering information about other similar entities and/or information on the industry by which to assess its performance. HDs seldom view themselves as “business entities” and have little experience with the benchmarking process. Information from benchmarking activities is frequently used to drive strategic directions and provide ongoing monitoring of performance. Benchmarking is commonly part of a larger effort of continuous quality improvement, known as CQI (United States Department of Energy, 1996). For example, insurers in the arena of managed care compared the practices of physicians in their networks to establish benchmarks or the standards by which physician performance would be assessed. Benchmarking is a first step in assessing the performance of an organization across any metric. A key aspect of benchmarking is choosing the relevant performer(s) or standard to which a company (or HD) would like to compare itself. Also, the type of performance and the standard by which the performance will be measured are also critically important. Given their output and the varied circumstances in which HDs operate, using this benchmarking in any form may seem formidable. One method of benchmarking is using the cost-effectiveness plane. It maps expenditures and performance in a four quadrant display. Shown in Fig. 1 , the Report of Performance Measures (RPM) is based on the model of the cost-effectiveness plane (Black, 1990). The RPM displays performance scores on the horizontal axis and some measure of cost or program expenditure on the vertical axis. As shown in the figure, from any given starting point, a move to the right along the performance (X) axis indicates relatively better performance, whereas a move to the left indicates relatively lower performance. A move upward on the expenditure access (Y) axis indicates relatively higher expenditures, whereas a move downward indicates relatively lower expenditures. Fig. 1 also gives relative quadrant descriptions. A move towards or into Quadrant II indicates increased cost-effectiveness, a key performance goal. CQI is signified by establishing a performance baseline and comparing this to a standard or looking at moves over time from baseline. Benchmarking allows a HD to establish a baseline by which to begin the CQI process and establish some sense of relative performance. If we assume Point A is the reference point for one HD in a single period, the HD may compare itself (Point A) to other HDs (Points B–D) as a starting place. From an initial assessment, a HD at Point A in comparison to other HDs may find: (1) similar performance and similar expenditure (Point A–B); (2) lower performance and lower expenditure (Point A–C); (3) similar performance and lower expenditures (Point A–D), and (4) higher performance for similar expenditure (Point A–E). The optimal Point are A–D: similar performance for lower expenditure and A–E: higher performance for the similar expenditure. The RPM can also be used for more advanced benchmarking and to assess performance within an organization over time. Changes over time are referred to as incremental analyses (Drummond et al., 2005). For example, a common situation is a program spending more for greater performance (Fig. 1; Point A–C). From a managerial perspective, questions raised in this instance are: why and where did the expenditure increase occur and what did it produce in terms of performance gains? In addition, the grid can help Identify potential inefficiencies, such as increased expenditure for the same performance (Fig. 1; Point A–D), or lower performance for the same expenditure (Fig. 1; Point A–E). By linking measures of program performance and spending or costs, the RPM can provide information on: single or multiple internal programs’ performance over time; information on performance within different levels or aspects of a single program, and information to compare programs. If expenditures and performances are greater over two periods, the RPM reflects these changes and can direct managers to explore what factors led to the change within a program or programs. Repeating the exercise at micro-levels with specific performance measures can provide a great deal of information about observed changes. Performance indicators at various levels of an organization likely require internal development and can lead to establishment of a CQI program. A useful, if not necessary, starting point is benchmarking. Two programs, deemed similar, can be assessed in terms of how well they perform in relation to each other across defined, common metrics. Managers must also decide what ranges of change in scores and percent expenditures are significant to them. The RPM can provide a mechanism for monitoring changes; directing further examination of determinants of expenditure and performance; and facilitating increases in managerial understanding of expenditures in relation to performance. Here, the focus is a comparison of two, similar HDs in a single period.   2.2 Focus on TB in Florida The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released its report regarding TB in May 2000. Ending Neglect laid out a plan to eliminate TB in the U.S., defined as an incidence of less than one case per million persons per year (Geiter, 2000). The report acknowledges that federal, state, and local cooperation is crucial, but emphasizes that health impacts mostly occur at state and local levels where funding translates into program activities. The report calls for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of program performance using national standards and, specifically, for TB programs to demonstrate accountability in relation to spending and performance. Most HDs at the local level have few tools at their disposal to respond to this mandate. The state of Florida has an overall TB incidence rate of 6.3 cases per 100,000 persons (2003 data). Hillsborough County Health Department (HCHD) in Florida had begun to analyze its performance and expenditures in response to the IOM report in early 2002. Their approach was soon taken up by other Florida counties. Thus, county-level data were available as part of local monitoring efforts. The example used here for explication of the RPM is data from two county-based Florida TB programs. In order to demonstrate the concept of benchmarking, Duval County Health Department (DCHD) and Hillsborough County HD provided data. These two counties have high-incidence rates and are two of six high-TB morbidity counties in Florida. Hillsborough County, population of 1.1 million persons, has a TB incidence rate of 7.2 cases per 100,000 persons, while Duval County, population of 829,230 persons, has a TB incidence rate of 8.4 cases per 100,000 persons, the highest in the state of Florida. Also, critically, both counties have similar expenditures related to TB surveillance. DCHD spends $581,568 on surveillance activities and $746,156 on administrative support for surveillance, while HCHD spent $572,194 and $857,995, respectively (personal communication: SJA). Livingood, Coughlin, Bowman, Bryant, and Goldhagen (2007) have used Florida counties, including Hillsborough and Duval for comparisons, suggesting comparability. Other authors have noted the importance of controlling for program level differences when looking at cost and performance (Diex-Roux, 2000; Subramanian, Ekwueme, Gardner, Bapat, & Kramer, 2008). We addressed this issue to a degree by choosing the two HDs most similar in the state and in direct surveillance expenditures, but recognize all program level differences have not been taken into account. Thus, the analysis here should be ultimately viewed as a demonstration.   2.3 Surveillance as a key public health activity In response to the IOM report, Florida Hillsborough County Health Department (HCHD) chose to focus the analysis of its performance on surveillance-related activities. Surveillance, in various forms, is viewed by public health practitioners and experts across the spectrum as a primary public health function, although it and its components may be described somewhat differently. For example, in a seminal report, the IOM identified three core functions for public health, applicable at all governmental levels. The basic premise was that public health organizations should focus on assuring conditions in which people could be healthy rather than provide health care services (IOM, 1988). The IOM outlined three areas in which public health activities should occur: assessment, including surveillance; policy development, based in part on surveillance outcomes; and assurance. Others have focused on surveillance as a key piece of these responsibilities (Author, 2004; Hepburn, Eger, Kim, & Slade, 2007; Public Health Foundation, 1995). For the Florida demonstration, surveillance was disaggregated into six core activities: detection, registration, reporting, confirmation, acute response, and planned response, some of which were further defined into constituent components. These activities were chosen as a starting point in the monitoring effort as they were associated with eleven nationally defined performance indicators in the IOM report (Geiter, 2000) shown in Table 1 . Given this was a new venture for both counties, use of these indicators was readily accepted by staff. This aspect is particularly important as launching an evaluation program can be viewed as a negative endeavor by staff. Staff may view it as an assessment of their individual performance or an assessment which might affect staffing levels or funding to their program. After staff received the report, indicators were clearly defined and their purpose was made clear. In this instance, the staff was aware the programs were being evaluated at a macro-rather than micro-level.  ",0
5237,S0003426607000406,Adrenal tuberculosis after a pheochromocytoma: a misleading tumoral presentation," 2 Case report In February 2002, a 63-year-old woman presented to a heart specialist complaining of acute malaise with palpitations, headaches and hot flushes. Since a few months, she was treated for hypertension with labetolol. Her past medical history was remarkable for primitive breast cancer at 59 years of age treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy followed by tamoxifen treatment. She had a family history of breast, kidney and bladder cancers. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed paroxysmal hypertension, synchrone with symptoms. Urinary catecholamines and metanephrenines assay (HPLC) showed a marked increase in the excretion of free noradrenalin, 2286 nmol/24 hours (N: 90–500) and methoxynoradrenaline, 9.26 ?mol/24 hours (N: 0.5–2). Plasma noradrenaline concentration was markedly elevated at 40 nmol/l (N: 0.5–2) while the excretion of adrenaline, dopamine and their metabolites was within the normal range. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2.5×3 cm inhomogeneous mass located in the left adrenal gland characterized by a hypervascularized peripheral rim and a central area of low attenuation (Fig. 1 ). No other abnormality was observed on this CT scan at any sites including the right adrenal gland. A whole-body (I131) meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy did not demonstrate any abnormal uptake, but was performed while the patient was under labetolol medication. The diagnosis of adrenal pheochromocytoma secreting noradrenaline was highly suspected. The patient underwent video-laparoscopic surgery to remove the entire left adrenal gland. This gland weighed 15 g and contained a well-circumscribed tumor of 2.5×1.5 cm size with central necrotic area. Pathological examination confirmed a pheochromocytoma with 3/10 high power field mitotic rate with no capsular or vascular invasion. One month after surgery, the patient was asymptomatic, blood pressure was normalized without treatment and levels of urinary noradrenaline and methoxynoradrenaline had returned within the normal range, 407 and 0.56 ?mol/24 hours, respectively. Based on clinical and biological findings, a genetic disease such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, Von Hippel-Lindau's disease or neurofibromatosis was ruled out. The patient remained asymptomatic for 1 year, then returned complaining again of hot flushes and headaches. At first, a recurrence of pheochromocytoma was suspected. Physical examination was unremarkable. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring demonstrated normal blood pressure profile. Repeat laboratory investigation did not give further evidence of relapse: catecholamines and metanephrines assayed both in plasma and urine remained within the normal range, serum chromogranin A was normal 60 ?g/l (N: 20–100). However, an enhanced adrenal CT scan showed a newly occurring right adrenal mass measuring 1.5 cm in the longest diameter, mimicking the CT features of the left resected pheochromocytoma. Indeed, this tumor was characterized by a peripheral tissular rim delineating a central hypodensity (Fig. 2 ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the same findings on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted slices, while the adrenal mass was not seen on T2-weighted images. No tumoral signal loss was observed on out of phase images when using the in phase-out of phase T1-weighted sequence (chemical shift sequence). Tamoxifen was suspected to contribute to hot flushes. Indeed the withdrawal of this treatment resulted in the disappearance of symptoms. A repeat adrenal CT scan performed 4 months later revealed a slight increase in volume of the right adrenal mass. Attenuation values in Hounsfield units were 35 on unenhanced CT and 43 on enhanced CT. Considering the previous history of breast cancer; the diagnosis of adrenal metastasis was entertained at this time. Mammography showed no evidence of local recurrence. Total bone scintigraphy was normal as were CT scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis. Biological parameters were unremarkable including inflammatory and tumoral markers such as CRP, 1 mg/l (N<5), ACE, 2 ?g/l (N: 0–5), CA15.3, 18 U/ml (N<25). Morning serum cortisol was normal, 180 ?g/l (normal range, 70–250) as was corticotropin/ACTH, 40 ng/l (N: 0–52). HIV serology was negative. Because of the tumoral evolutivity and the uncertainty of the nature of that lesion, the patient underwent a new video-laparoscopic surgery to remove the entire right adrenal gland. The gland contained two adjacent firm whitish tumors measuring, respectively, 1 and 2 cm in the longest diameter. Immunohistological analysis showed granulomatous inflammation with central caseous necrosis strongly suggesting tuberculosis (Fig. 3 ). Ziehl–Neelsen stain on microscopic section was negative. However, bacterial investigation confirmed the suspicion of tuberculosis infection. Cultures of adrenal specimen in specific middlebrook 7H12 medium by radiometric procedure were positive after 3 weeks. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified by Geno-type MTBC Test (Hain Lifescience, Germany). Retrospectively, the patient disclosed that she had presented a tuberculosis primo-infection at 10 years of age. The resulting adrenal insufficiency was treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replacement. Triple antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide) was initiated for 4 months, then switched to a bitherapy for 2 months. ",0

5344,S1875957217301201,Congenital tuberculosis after in vitro fertilization presenting with endobronchial granuloma," 2 Case report We present a case of congenital TB in a twin female. She was born prematurely at 27 weeks of gestation from a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy after in vitro fertilization. After birth, she developed respiratory distress, and subsequently she was mechanically ventilated for 3 days. At 4 weeks of age, she developed a progressively worsening dyspnea that required ventilation with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. She was started with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her twin sister died 60 days after birth as a result of respiratory distress and sepsis. The postmortem examination revealed disseminated TB. The analysis of the mother's placenta showed acid-fast bacilli. The results of a TST and a QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (Quest Diagnostics, Secaucus, NJ) were negative. Gastric aspiration was performed and revealed negative results for acid-fast bacilli, but the results of culture and polymerase chain reaction were positive for M. tuberculosis. Therefore, the infant was transferred to our tertiary care children's university hospital. The result of an abdominal ultrasound was normal, and no growth of M. tuberculosis was found in the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or urine. Treatment with isoniazid (10 mg/kg/d), rifampicin (20 mg/kg/d), pyrazinamide (30 mg/kg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and prednisone (1 mg/kg/d) was started. The treatment was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged to home with follow-up at the infectious diseases unit of our hospital. Antimicrobial sensitivities were available after 5 weeks of incubation, and they showed resistance to pyrazinamide. Prednisone was stopped after 1 month of treatment as was pyrazinamide owing to sensitivities, whereas ethambutol was continued for a total of 2 months. At 4 months of age, the girl started to present mild intermittent respiratory distress. She was initially treated with nebulized adrenalin and oral betamethasone. Subsequently, she was readmitted to our hospital because of cervical lymphadenopathy, which drained spontaneously. A chest x-ray was done for increasing respiratory distress, and a complete opacity of the right lung with mild mediastinal shift was found (Fig. 1 ). Computed tomography revealed multiple enlarged mediastinal and subpleural lymph nodes with central hypodensity and atelectasis of the right lung. The patient was started back on prednisone and ethambutol. However, 2 weeks later she developed respiratory worsening, and bronchoscopy revealed a complete luminal obstruction of the right main bronchus caused by tuberculous granuloma (Fig. 2 ). Endobronchial treatment was performed with the patient under general anesthesia with a rigid bronchoscope and using a diode laser. The interventional bronchoscopy led to prompt clinical improvement. At 9 months of age, another therapeutic bronchoscopy with clearance of a new granuloma of the right bronchus was required. Prednisone was stopped after 3 months, and the antituberculous drugs were stopped after 15 months of treatment. The result of follow-up bronchoscopy at 2 years of age was normal, and a chest x-ray showed nearly complete resolution of the TB lesions. At 6-year follow-up, the patient was developing well and was completely asymptomatic. ",0
5370,S0022522307002103,Sternal tuberculosis after sternotomy for coronary artery bypass surgery: A case report and review of the literature," Discussion TB of the sternum has rarely been reported in the literature. Primary sternal TB is relatively more common compared with sternal TB secondary to surgery. A Medline search for cases of sternal TB detected after sternotomy for heart surgery revealed only 4 case reports, highlighting the rarity of the condition. 1-4   TB of the sternum is rare (1.5% of osteoarticular TB). 5  Up to one third of such patients had a detectable tuberculous lesion in other parts of the skeleton or in the lungs. Our patient had no evidence of skeletal TB, and his chest radiography showed no evidence of prior TB. Sternal TB often presents as an abscess or sinus in the region of the sternum. Radiographic findings of sternal TB occur much later than those taken with clinical measurements. Radiography may reveal irregular cavities and areas of destruction in the bone with little surrounding sclerosis (honeycomb appearance), and there may be soft tissue swelling. The cavities may contain soft feathery sequestra, and the bone may show subperiosteal new bone formation. This clinicoradiologic picture needs to be differentiated from chronic pyogenic osteomyelitis, Brodie’s abscess, tumors, or rare granulomatous conditions. Diagnosis is usually made by culture of the discharge or by histopathologic examination or culture of the resected tissue. Initial culture reports may be negative, and in cases with recurrent nonhealing wounds, repeat cultures for TB should be advised. Tuberculous osteomyelitis responds well to antitubercular drugs. Lesions can be seen radiologically to start healing by 6 months. Response depends on the stage of disease when treatment was started. Surgical excision is justified in refractory cases, whenever there is a doubt in diagnosis, in the presence of a large abscess in the soft tissues around the involved bone, or to remove large sequestrum. Surgical treatment for tuberculous osteomyelitis of the sternum involves extensive debridement and curettage of all involved tissue. The defect can be closed primarily if possible or more commonly by mobilization of the overlying pectoralis major as a flap. Other methods described in the literature include vacuum-assisted closure with a drain or use of a pedicled omental flap to help close the defect. This case is being reported to make clinicians aware of this rare cause of sternal wound infection after sternotomy. Because of the rarity of the condition and often mild local symptoms, there may be a delay in diagnosis. The possibility of sternal TB should be kept in mind in any patient with a nonhealing ulcer or abscess in the sternal region. With awareness of the condition, diagnosis can be made preoperatively and antituberculous treatment instituted. Surgery with a complete course of antituberculous treatment gives good long-term results. ",0

We detected massive right pleural effusion and ascites requiring urgent drainage. Assessment of the pleural and peritoneal fluids suggested exudative serositis: pleural effusion—fluid/serum protein ratio 1.07; fluid/serum LDH ratio 0.8; WBC 170 mm3 with 20% neutrophil cells and 80% other cells, mainly lymphocytes; and peritoneal effusion—total protein 32 g/L; serum/ascites albumin concentration gradient 0.7; WBC 1180 mm3with 5% neutrophil cells and 95% other cells, mainly lymphocytes. No common pathogens were detected in the fluid cultures, nor was Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) observed by microscopic analysis. A positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for MT (specific for IS6610 insertion element of MT complex) was obtained with the pleural but not the ascitic fluid. Pleural and peritoneal biopsies revealed mild nonspecific inflammation. Fluid cultures for MT were subsequently negative. Anti-CMV IgM and the serum P65 antigen of CMV in the peripheral lymphocytes were also negative. Portal hypertension was excluded by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, Doppler ultrasonography of the portal vein, and measurements of the portohepatic vein pressure gradient.",0

Disseminated tuberculosis in children is rare in Canada, and potential sources must be considered in each case. Further investigation of this child's history revealed that his neonatal caregiver was a grandparent with a history of tuberculosis. This case demonstrates that tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of kyphosis in infants. The clinical and radiological findings were advanced, suggesting that he had the disease for a long time. The authors felt that his seizure at 3 months of age was probably a presentation of cerebral involvement.",0
5441,S0264410X05012983,"Protective effect of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in children with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, but not the pulmonary disease: A case-control study in Rosario, Argentina"," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Design and setting The present study is a hospital-based case-control study carried out at the Children's Hospital Victor J. Vilela from Rosario city, during the 1994–1999 period. The city is located in the littoral area of Argentina and represents a population of more than a million people. The centre is a tertiary hospital with a Respiratory Service and Internal Medicine Unit, from which clinical and laboratorial data of subjects were obtained. All participants belonged to families from the lower and upper-lower socioeconomic status, showing no between-group differences in place of residence, age, sex, and ethnic characteristics. Parents or legal guardians were informed of the study purposes and gave their informed consent for children to be included in the study.   2.2 Selection of cases Cases (n =148) were children aged less than 12 years living in the Rosario area with a proven diagnosis of TB. The diagnosis of TB was based on the isolation of M. tuberculosis from any body site or presence of clinical findings consistent with TB, i.e., chronic cough; loss of weight or failure to gain weight, within the previous 3 months and at least two of the following criteria [5,6]: (a) positive PPD reaction (2TU, PPD RT23 prepared at the Malbrán Institute, Buenos Aires, Argentina; (b) chest X-ray compatible with TB: parenchymal infiltrate, atelectasis, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy and (c) household contact with an acid-fast-bacilli (AFB) smear-positive adult case: contagious focus. Other studies which were carried out when necessary included: histopathology, computerized tomography and endoscopy. None of them had any concomitant disease able to cause similar findings and the subsequent clinical course was consistent with TB. Cases were treated according to the national rules established by the Minister of Health.   2.3 Selection of controls Controls (n =782) were selected randomly among children that during the 1994–1999 period concurred to the Children's Hospital showing neither respiratory disease nor any other infectious illnesses. The exclusion criteria for the controls were a history suggestive of the manifestations of any form of TB in the past and a recent family history of TB.   2.4 BCG vaccination The BCG vaccination is concentrated mainly on newborn children and children of the first-year class in primary school. The recommended intradermal dose is 0.1ml in the left deltoid region. The vaccine employed in Argentina since 1984 is prepared at the La Plata Central Laboratory of Public Health (based on the Paris seed lot). BCG vaccination was evaluated by looking for the BCG scar in the region the vaccine is applied, or immunisation record. Physicians taking part in the BCG vaccination assessment were kept blind to the study groups. Children had only one vaccination card.   2.5 Statistical analysis Because of the increased number of vaccinated controls (97%), and considering a 0.30 expected odd ratio—OR of vaccine effectiveness, five controls for each case were included, to assure a 95% confidence level and 80% study power. The chi square and Fisher's exact tests were employed. Crude and adjusted ORs were estimated to assess the protective effect of BCG. The Stata statistical software was used to calculate the OR and their 95% confidence interval (CI). Adjustments for potential confounders were evaluated by the unconditional logistic regression method. Estimates of BCG effectiveness and prevented fraction were assessed by validated methods [7,8]. All participants were recorded for the following variables, age, sex, nutritional status, BCG coverage, PPD reaction, presence of a household contagious focus and year of study admission. To assess the nutrition status the following score was calculated, Z =actual measure–median or 50 percentile according to age/standard deviation—S.D. [9]. The WHO recommends using a Z-score less than 2 S.D. units below the reference median as a cut-off point for the purposes of defining abnormally low values.  ",0
5451,S0954611105003471,"Concurrent presentations of the sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and lymphoma in a single patient"," Case report A 56-year-old female patient with dyspnea, cough and fever was admitted to our clinic in February 2005. She had been found to have a mediastinal tumor during investigation for exertional dyspnea 7 years before and was operated for that. Mediastinal multiple lymphadenopathy was noted during the operation and the largest one, 5×6cm in size, was excised. Histopathological examination yielded granulomatous lymphadenitis consistent with sarcoidosis. No medication was given after the diagnosis. She had been feeling well about 7 years until May 2004. After that time she begun to suffer from exertional dyspnea and dry cough. Prednisolon 20mgqd was prescribed. Despite regular medication use, her complaints progressed, cough turned to be productive and fever was added in the last month. She quit prednisolon 10 days prior to admission. On admission, her vital sings were stable except body temperature 38.7°C. Physical examination revealed cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal lymphadenopathies, fine crackles on lower lung parts and a 5cm of hepatomegaly. Pertinent routine laboratory investigation values were WBC 13.1×103/?L with 20% eosinophils, Hb 11.3g/dL, platelets 347×103/?L, ESR 17mm/h, CRP 17mg/dL, ALT 21U/L, AST 38U/L, GGT 87U/L, ALP 234U/L, total bilirubin 0.25mg/dL, albumin 3.1g/dL, LDH 408U/L. Tuberculin skin test was anergic. Routine cultures and sputum examination for acid fast bacilli (AFB) and tuberculous PCR were negative, which were repeated for three times. Multiple mediastinal, hilar, portal, and intraabdominal lymphadenopathies and hepatomegaly were found at thoracoabdominal CT. There was no interstitial lung involvement on high-resolution thorax CT but a calcific milimetric nodule was found at left upper lobe. Liver biopsy exhibited intrahepatic cholangitis due to possible biliary outflow obstruction, with no signs of sarcoidosis or neoplastic infiltration. Bone marrow biopsy was normocellular. Excisional cervical lymph node biopsy revealed effacement of the lymph node architecture broadly by extensive fibrosis, hyalinization and granulomas containing multinucleated langhans-type giant cells. Minimally caseating necrosis and a few AFB were seen in a few areas. The tissue tuberculous PCR analysis was negative. However, because of AFB were seen, her clinical presentation was consistent with tuberculosis and tuberculosis is relatively prevalent in our region an empirical antituberculous therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol was instituted. After an 18 day-course of antituberculous treatment, no improvement was noted. Amikacin and moxifloxacin were added to her therapy for the possibility of resistant mycobacterial infection. One week later under that antimicrobial therapy, severe sepsis developed with new infiltrations on chest X-ray. Therefore meropenem and vancomycin were employed and antituberculous therapy was discontinued. A second excisional lymph node biopsy from supraclavicular region was reported as ALK-negative anaplastic T cell lymphoma involvement (Fig. 1 ). She died due to acinetobacter sepsis soon after the diagnosis of lymphoma. Her tuberculous cultures of sputum, supraclavicular lymph node and bone marrow were found to be negative subsequently. ",0
5494,S1930043315301771,Reactivation Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Presenting as Empyema Necessitans 55 Years Following Thoracoplasty," Case Report A 79-year-old male presented to his primary care physician with the chief complaint of an enlarging lump on his chest. He first noticed it 2-3 days prior to presentation, and thought it had increased in size over that time. He had no pain, fevers, chills, or malaise. The patient's past medical history was significant for tuberculosis which was treated with left pneumonectomy and thoracoplasty in 1950. He had oxygen dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. On physical examination, he had an erythematous lump on his left anterolateral chest wall. It was fluctuant and mildly tender. His temperature was 99.2 degrees Farinheit. Needle aspiration of the lump yielded pus. An incision and drainage was performed, which revealed copious pus and a large abscess cavity, estimated to measure approximately 15 × 7 cm. On exploration and palpation of the wound, there was concern for communication with the pleural space. A chest radiograph was obtained (Fig. 1 ). This demonstrated truncation and deformation of the upper left ribs with collapse of the chest wall and volume loss of the left hemithorax. The left hemithorax was nearly completely opacified and plaque like calcifications were present along the chest wall. A small amount of air was present. Subsequently, computed tomography of the chest was performed (Fig. 2  ). This demonstrated absence of most of the left first through 7th ribs and distortion and collapse of the left upper thorax. The upper chest wall was apposed to the superior mediastinum. The hemithorax was peripherally calcified and filled with fluid and several air-fluid levels. Lobular areas of high attenuation tissue were contiguous with the chest wall, mediastinum and diaphragmatic surfaces. The subcutaneous abscess cavity was filled with air and fluid. Intraoperative bronchoscopy revealed a normal right bronchus and intact left bronchial stump without evidence of bronchopleural fistula. A left thoracotomy incision was made and 2 left ribs were resected. The pleural space was filled with 400cc of pus, white necrotic material, and lobules of granular, clay-like yellow material. Following extraction of this material, an Eloesser flap was created by sewing the skin to the parietal pleura, creating a 4 × 10cm opening for pleural drainage. The patient tolerated the surgery well. 2+ Acid fast bacilli were present on AFB stain of the pleural fluid. Appropriate anti-tuberculous therapy was initiated. ",0
5566,S1201971205000111,Brain abscess due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a patient with AIDS: report of a case and review of the literature,"A 25-year-old man, seropositive for HIV-1 was admitted in January 2002 with headache and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He was heterosexual and had a history of inhalatory drug use. He had not received antiretroviral therapy. His past medical history revealed cerebral toxoplasmosis in 2000 and pulmonary TB due to MTB resistant to isoniazid in January 2001. The patient was treated with rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and ciprofloxacin, but he developed toxic hepatitis and rifampin was discontinued. Physical and neurological examinations on presentation were unremarkable, without focal abnormalities. Papilloedema was absent. Laboratory investigations revealed moderate anemia and leukopenia. Chest radiograph was normal. The CD4 T cell count was 43cell/?L. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a hypodense, ring enhancing, left temporoparietal lesion with marked perilesional edema (Figure 1 ). Lumbar puncture was performed, with the following results: protein 60mg/dL, glucose 65mg/dL, white blood cells 10/mm3 (100% lymphocytes). Gram, india ink and acid fast bacilli (AFB) stains were negative. Treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine was started. After three weeks without response to empiric antitoxoplasma treatment a stereotactic brain biopsy was performed. The material was caseous purulent and the surgical findings were consistent with an abscess, which was drained. Histopathologic examination showed an extensive inflammatory infiltrate, without granulomatous reaction, caseous necrosis and Langhans cells, but with a marked predominance of neutrophis. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain showed abundant AFB. Grocott and PAS stains were negative. Direct examination and culture of abscess material were positive for MTB. The isolate was found to be resistant to isoniazid and ethambutol. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin, rifampin, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide with good initial clinical and radiological response. Two months later he developed faciobrachiocrural hemiplegia. An axial diffusion T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI-DWI) showed a hyperdense signal involving the posterior limb of the left internal capsule. A digital carotid artery angiogram was performed and revealed an arteritis in the left posterior cerebral artery territory. The patient's state of consciousness deteriorated and he died.",0

The Institute’s Human Ethical committee was constituted following the guidelines laid by Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, which is responsible for formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research and has the sole authority for giving approval for the Ethical committees of the various Institutes of the country. The written informed consent was obtained from all participants of the study. For children, written informed consent was obtained from a parent or guardian. Two hundred and five pulmonary tuberculosis cases (PTB) (mean age 32.25±12.83; male: female 0.68:0.32) and 127 healthy controls (mean age 33.58±12.08; male: female 0.49:0.51) were included in the study. We could analyze TLR1 743 A>G variant in 205 PTB patients and 127 healthy controls and TLR6 745 C>T variant in 204 PTB patients and 124 healthy controls. We also analyzed TLR 1 1805 T>G in 160 PTB patients and 124 healthy controls. A description regarding the subject’s age, sex, smoking habits, drinking habits, BCG vaccination was recorded with the help of the interview schedule at the time of recruiting the cases and controls.  2.1.1 Pulmonary tuberculosis cases (PTB cases) Patients with pulmonary TB, age ranging from 12 to 70years were included in the study. PTB patients were recruited from the outpatient department (OPD) of State Tuberculosis Demonstration Centre (STDC), Agra during the period from 2007 to 2011 who were registered in the OPD on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the PTB patients and agreed to participate in the study. The majority of these patients were residents of Agra or nearby area, within the state of Uttar Pradesh. The patients were selected on the basis of defined clinical criteria, including the standard respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, expectoration, and malaise), sputum smear and/or culture positivity were diagnosed on the basis of Acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear positivity by Zeil Neelsen staining and clinical symptoms following the guidelines of Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) [14]. As a routine, two, sputum samples were collected over 2days (on spot/morning sputum). By definition, a new smear-positive pulmonary TB case was diagnosed when any of the sputum sample shows smears positive results. Further, AFB culture was performed in Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) slant and M. tuberculosis was confirmed by biochemical tests as per the protocol described in Vestal et al. [15]. Patients showing symptoms of other form of tuberculosis, seropositive for HIV infection or any other immunosuppressive disorders like diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study.   2.1.2 Healthy controls (HCs) Healthy unrelated subjects belonging to the same socioeconomic status who were accompanying PTB patients to the hospital and students came for training and project work to our Institute and randomly selected healthy individuals from the population by house to house survey method who were residing in the same geographical area as those of cases and agreed to participate in the present study were included as healthy controls. Schedules related to the details of subjects were filled and those with a recent history of fever, viral infection, other illness or any other immunological disease and who have under gone treatment for tuberculosis or leprosy in the past and any family history of tuberculosis and persons found to be positive for AFB smear tests were excluded from the study. Those individuals who were completely healthy between 16 and 63years of age were included in the present study. The controls were inoculated with 0.1ml (5 Tuberculin Units) PPD antigen intradermally and induration was noted after 48–72h of application in 36 healthy controls. Among them 21 (58%) were negative and 15 (42%) were positive. None of the PPD positive individuals developed the active form of PTB disease so far. The PTB patients and control subjects represented geographical homogeneity as all belonged to the area in or surrounding Agra and were from same socio- economic status, presumably having similar living conditions. The detail description of PTB cases and healthy controls is given in Table 1 .    2.2 Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection  TLR1 743 A>G SNP was chosen as it is reported to be functionally relevant and present in the extracellular domain of TLR1 involved in ligand binding activity [11]. This SNP was found to be commonly present in Bangladeshi population [9] and there is single report so far in Indian population stating the frequencies of minor allele frequency in eastern Indian population [16]. Hence, attempt was made to evaluate its frequency and significance in north Indian population and to look for its association with cases. Another SNP TLR6 745 C>T was chosen as it is present in extracellular domain of the TLR6 which is important in signaling [8] and reported to be associated with TB in American African population [11], again there is a single report from India on this polymorphism from south Indian population [13]. TLR1 1805 T>G was analysed in some of these subjects to clarify the linkage with TLR1 743 A>G.   2.3 Genotyping method DNA was isolated from 2ml blood collected in tubes containing acid citrate dextrose (ACD) from each subjects using the DNA isolation kit (Midi prep) from Qiagen, Germany. Genotyping of the SNP TLR1 743 A>G, TLR 1 1805 T>G and TLR6 745 C>T was performed by melting curve analysis on genomic DNA using fluorescence labeled hybridization fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes (TIB MolBiol, Berlin, Germany) and the Light Cycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics, Berline, Germany). The protocol for TLR 1 743 A>G detection was followed as described in the report of Schurring et al. [9]. The primers and probe sequences used for amplification and FRET mechanism for detection of TLR6 745 C>T snp are as given below. 5?-GAAAGACTCTGACCAGGCAT-3? and 5?-CTAGTTTATTCGCTATCCAAGTG-3?, along with FRET probes 5?-ACCAGAGGTCCAACCTTACTGAA-3? (3?-labeled with fluorescein) and 5?-TTACCCTCAACCACATAGAAACGACTTGGA-3? (5?labeled with LCRed640). PCR was performed using 1.5?l DNA, primers (TLR6 745 C>T-sense; TLR6 745 C>T-antisense) at 1.25pmol, 2.5mM MgCl2, and 250nM of the TLR6 745 C>T sensor probe and TLR6 745 C>T anchor probe. The sensor probe was labeled with fluorescein at the 3? end. The anchor probe was labeled with Light Cycler Red 640 at the 5? end. The amplification was performed in the Light Cycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics) using the following parameters: initial denaturation at 95°C for 4min, 35 cycles of amplification with denaturation (95°C for 10s) annealing (52°C for 20s) and extension (72°C for 20s) then melting curve analysis with 1 cycle at 95°C for 1m, 40°C for 30s, followed by an increase of temperature to 80°C and final cooling at 40°C. The melting peaks at 55°C and 65°C were observed for TLR6 745T allele and TLR6 745C allele respectively. For TLR1 1805 T>G snp, the sequences of primers and probes are as follows: 5?-TGTGACTACCCGGAAAGTTATAGA3? and 5?-CCAGAAAGAATCGTGCC-3?, along with FRET probes 5?-CCATGCTGGTGTTGGCTGTGACTGTG-3? (3?-labeled with fluorescein) and 5?-CCTCCCTCTGCATCTACTTGGAT-3? (5?-labeled with LCRed640. PCR for TLR1 1805 T>G was performed using 1.5?l DNA, primers (TLR1 1805 T>G-sense; TLR1 1805 T>G-antisense) at 1.25pmol, 2.5mM MgCl2, and 250nM of the TLR1 1805 T>G sensor probe and TLR1 1805 T>G anchor probe. The sensor probe was labeled with fluorescein at the 3? end. The anchor probe was labeled with Light Cycler Red 640 at the 5? end. The amplification was performed in the Light Cycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics) using the following parameters: initial denaturation at 95°C for 4min, 45 cycles of amplification with denaturation (95°C for 15s) annealing (60°C for 20s) and extension (72°C for 20s) then melting curve analysis with 1 cycle at 95°C for 1m, 40°C for 1m, followed by an increase of temperature to 95°C and final cooling at 40°C. The melting peaks at 62°C and 68°C were observed for TLR1 1805G allele and TLR11805T (allele respectively).   2.4 Serum Interleukin 6 (IL6) measurement The level of IL6 was measured in sera of 50 PTB patients and 49 healthy controls using the Duo set ELISA kit (R&D systems, USA), as per the manufacturer’s instructions.   2.5 Statistical analysis Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was examined in controls and patients by ? 2 test. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between patients and controls for finding the strength of association by chi square test, magnitude of association was expressed as Odd ratio (OR) with 95% CI. P <0.05 was considered as significant for all analyses. Variables such as age, gender, BCG, smoking and drinking habits were tested for posing potential confounders for association analysis and Mantel–Haenszel (M–H) adjusted OR was represented. Logistic regression for association analysis and all other analyses were carried out using STATA/SE11.0 software (StataCorp LP Lake way drive, college station, TX, USA). Haplotype analysis and association was carried out using online software SNP stats [17]. Cytokine analysis was done using Graph Pad Prism 3 software and the median levels of the cytokine between cases and controls were compared and the median levels of cytokine among various genotypes in controls were compared using Mann Whitney test.

5651,S0008418215300892,Unilateral primary tuberculosis presenting as an extratarsal chalazion," Case Study A 10-year-old female presented with a newly developed cherry-red mass of about 1-month duration, which was located away from the edge of the right lower eyelid ( Fig. 1). She had a history of surgery for a chalazion in the right lower eyelid; the surgery had been performed 5 months previously through a conjunctival approach. Other signs of systemic infection or lymphadenopathies were absent. Computed tomography (CT) of the orbit revealed a highly enhancing solid tumour (20 × 12 × 17 mm in size) in the right lower lid ( Fig. 2). Operation through a skin approach revealed a well-defined mass invading the subcutaneous-to-muscle layer without connection between the tarsus and skin or conjunctiva. Histopathologic examination with hematoxylin and eosin stain indicated chronic, noncaseating, granulomatous inflammation ( Fig. 3). M tuberculosis was confirmed by M tuberculosis complex polymerase chain reaction (see Fig. 3). The systemic evaluation for TB was not informative, and no evidence of immunosuppression was present. The results of the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast bacilli staining of sputum and gastric aspirate samples, and chest x-ray were negative. Systemic anti-TB therapy was not recommended by the Pediatrics department. The patient displayed no symptoms except for the eyelid lesion. At the 1-year follow-up after surgery, the wound had completely healed without anti-TB drug treatment. In endemic areas, TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a chronic painless eyelid swelling. Primary lid infection is very rare and may be caused by direct infection of bacilli through a skin defect or injury. 1,2  The early sign of eyelid TB is a red-brownish papule and a subsequent indurated nodule. When diagnosis is delayed, skin fistula and cicatricial entropion can occur. 2  Early-stage TB of the eyelid without accompanying signs of systemic infection or lymphadenopathies is difficult to distinguish from a true chalazion. Diagnosis of suspected lid TB can be established by specific histopathological findings, tuberculin skin test, and the staining and culture of acid-fast bacilli. Currently, the most useful diagnostic technique is PCR amplification and detection of specific segments of the tubercle bacilli DNA, which has high sensitivity and specificity. 3   PubMed has documented 4 case reports of eyelid TB and chalazia. 4–6  In 2 cases, the patients had isolated unilateral TB of the tarsal conjunctiva without systemic disease, whereas in the other 2 cases, it was associated with pulmonary TB. Our case revealed an atypical, extratarsal location of primary TB infection. We confirmed M tuberculosis by performing biopsy without delay because of the unusual presentation and history of conjunctival injury. Isolated unilateral TB of the eyelid will be missed initially if the curetted material is not sent for histopathology. 7  After slow formation of granuloma by infection with the bacilli from the primary conjunctival injury, the orbital septum might fuse to the capsulopalpebral fascia. Subsequently, the granuloma migrates to the lower eyelid (extratarsal area) from the inferior tarsal border. Inferior migration could occur on prolonged inflammation because M tuberculosis is a slow-growing bacterium. Primary infection through injury after drainage of the chalazion was the possible pathophysiology in our case, similar to primary lid TB after upper lid blepharoplasty. Extratarsal chalazia have other differential diagnoses. First, they can be misdiagnosed as malignant lid lesions. In addition, basal cell carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma, and orbital tumor are malignant mimics of chalazia. Biopsy is required for any ulceration or recurrent lid lesion. 8  Second, the lesion could be any one of other benign lesions, such as foreign body granuloma, fungal or viral infection, intratarsal keratinous cyst of the meibomian gland, dacryocystitis, and lacrimal gland duct stone. Lacrimal gland stones should be considered in cases of intractable chalazion-like masses in a superolateral area. 9   The incidence of TB in developed countries is declining, 10  but the disease remains endemic in developing countries. TB incidence in the United States was approximately 3.0 cases per 100,000 persons during 2013–2015. 11  The movement of people from countries with high rates of TB to other countries has had a major impact on the epidemiology of TB. For example, in Canada, the overall risk of TB was 12 times higher among immigrants compared with those born in Canada. 12  The clinical presentation of TB would be seen earlier in children than in adults, and children are also at much greater risk of developing extrapulmonary TB. 13   We recommend staining, culture, and biopsy of the curetted material and pus in cases of chalazia in atypical locations, previous history of lid injury, and recurrence. A presumptive diagnosis of infectious origin based on the findings of staining in a microscopic examination and culture may be helpful. PCR-based tests of the pathologic specimens are also useful, if available. This case highlights the need for ophthalmologists to consider lid TB and chalazia in cases with a similar presentation.  Ethics approval Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained from the university medical centres, and the design of the study followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.  ",0
5663,S1472979202000562,What is the limit to case detection under the DOTS strategy for tuberculosis control?," 2 Methods We use 6 consecutive years (1995–2000) of data reported to WHO by NTPs 1  to investigate the relationship between the geographical coverage of DOTS programmes within countries and the estimated case detection rate. “DOTS coverage” is the percentage of a national population that has access to DOTS, i.e. living in the catchment area of administrative districts that provide DOTS services. The “case detection rate” is the number of sputum smear-positive patients notified under DOTS in a given year divided by the estimated number of new smear-positive cases arising in that year. The case detection rate measures case finding under DOTS nationally; the ratio of detection to coverage measures the case detection rate within DOTS areas only. Detection under DOTS implies that patients receive the full package of support and treatment embodied in the DOTS strategy, including diagnosis by sputum smear microscopy and standard short-course chemotherapy preferably administered under direct observation. 3  We emphasize that patients who are undetected (i.e. not notified) by public health systems, including DOTS programmes, are not necessarily untreated; the great majority of TB patients probably receive anti-TB drugs in some combination. The problem is that the outcomes of treatment outside DOTS programmes are at best uncertain and often poor, with higher proportions of patients defaulting, failing treatment or dying. 1   Our focus is on the 22 HBCs that account for an estimated 80% of all new TB cases arising each year, i.e. 6.7 million out of 8.4 million cases in 2000. 4  We first establish the quantitative relationship between case detection and DOTS coverage for each of the 22 HBCs in the years 1995–2000. We then use this quantitative relation to forecast how the case detection rate will change with anticipated improvements in DOTS coverage up to 2010. We assume that DOTS coverage will improve as stated in national plans for TB control, 1  and that the current relationships between coverage and case detection will be preserved, unless NTPs adopt a more aggressive approach to case finding within designated DOTS areas. We then extend the arguments to 166 countries that adopted DOTS in the period 1997–2000, and to 202 countries that have notified cases to WHO. ",0

5800,S0168851010001764,Manifestations of tuberculosis stigma within the healthcare system: The case of Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan district in Ghana," 2 Methodology The study had ethical consent from the Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee. The data were collected in the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan district in the Western Region of Ghana between January and August 2005. This district was chosen because it is metropolitan in nature and has ethnic groups from most parts of the region and Ghana as a whole. Furthermore, there have been reported instances of unpleasant behaviour towards TB patients in some industries and companies within the district which anecdotally can be attributed to TB stigma. A total of 21 individual interviews (16 females and 5 males) and six focus groups (1 with health managers, 1 with staff providing TB services, and 4 with general staff) were conducted. The number of focus group participants ranged between 8 and 12 individuals, with each session lasting for 1–2h. Details of the focus group participants are shown in Table 1 . The study participants were selected from four (out of seven) government health institutions providing TB services in the district. The four institutions were purposely selected because they offer both in- and out-patient services for TB patients. The treatment regimens used throughout the country is based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) strategy [40,41]. Briefly, these treatment regimens are as follows. All new cases (Category I): sputum smear-positive PTB; smear negative PTB; and extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), are given a 6-month regimen consisting of 2 months of daily supervised rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin (2HRZE/4HR). 1   1 S: streptomycin; R: rifampicin; H: isoniazid; Z: pyrazinamide; E: ethambutol; T: thiacethazone. Numbers before the letters indicate the number in months of the phase of treatment.  Previously treated TB patients (Category II): relapse; treatment failure; and treatment after default, are given an 8-month regimen consisting of 3 months of daily supervised rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, supplemented by streptomycin during the first 2 months, followed by 5 months of daily rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol (2SRHZE/1RHZE/5RHE). Children less than 12 years (Category III) are given a 6-month regimen, consisting of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol and 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin (2HRZ/4HR). At each of the selected hospitals, the head of the facility was asked to identify appropriate persons from three groups of staff that work around TB patients: health managers, healthcare workers involved in the TB control programme, and those in other units of the hospital. Because experience with TB was a major criterion for participation in the study, more personnel were recruited from units where TB patients are more likely to be seen. For example, because internal medicine wards usually attend to more TB cases than obstetric and gynaecological wards, the number of study participants from the former was more than the latter. Data were collected in two stages: the focus groups were conducted first and later the individual interviews. Those who participated in the focus groups were excluded from the individual interviews. The focus groups were held within the hospital premises and were moderated by the first author, who introduced the topics for discussion, while research assistants, recruited and trained to help with data collection, recorded the discussions on audio tapes and took notes. The individual interviews were conducted face-to-face in the offices of the staff. Both the focus groups and individual interviews were conducted in English. The topics discussed were based on the literature, personal knowledge and experience of working in the TB control programme. The issues discussed were the same for both the focus groups and individual interviews and were grouped into themes. The first theme explored perceptions and feelings about posting of staff to TB units, while the second explored possible reasons for seeing TB as a shameful disease. The third explored the perception of TB patients as a ‘risk’ to society and feelings and reactions when interacting with TB patients. After each data collection activity, the research assistants used the recorded audio tapes and field notes to transcribe verbatim all the interviews. Immediately after that, the first author then used the audio tapes and field notes to cross-check each transcript, ensuring that they were correctly transcribed and provided feedback to the research assistants. The data analysis was facilitated by NVivo (QSR International Pty Ltd. Australia, Version 2.0). The analytic approach used was influenced by grounded theory techniques and procedures [42]. Initially, the transcripts were read through, line by line, to identify key themes (nodes) talked about by the participants. The identified nodes were used to develop a coding framework for coding the data. The coding process involved reading the transcripts, linking and connecting texts to the nodes they represent. If new nodes were identified while coding latter transcripts, they were added to the coding framework. Previously coded transcripts were then checked to identify texts representing the new nodes and coded appropriately. As the analysis progressed, themes that were identified as belonging to each other were organised into discrete categories and subcategories [42]. This was done through manipulation and organisation of free nodes into tree nodes, resulting in the creation of a hierarchy of nodes containing categories and subcategories. For example, at the beginning of the coding process, a free node called ‘TB shameful’ was created to which statements and reasons for regarding TB as a shameful disease were coded. In the course of coding, it was noticed that the participants mentioned various reasons why TB is regarded as a shameful disease. These texts were retrieved and read through to identify the various reasons given. These reasons then become subcategories or children, as they are called in NVivo, and were organised and hierarchically arranged under the parent node ‘TB shameful’. ",0
5929,S0422763816302321,Pseudochylothorax as the first manifestation of microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis," Case report A 53-year-old man, originated from Georgia, visited our outpatient clinic suffering from gradually progressive shortness of breath and non-productive cough for the past three months. He had a history of chronic HBV infection, drug abuse and was a current smoker. A remarkable left sided pleural effusion and unilateral pleural thickening, as well as atelectasis of the left upper field, were the initial chest X-ray findings (Fig. 1 ). Diagnostic thoracentesis revealed a dense and milky effusion with 133cells/mm3, predominant lymphocyte cell type and pH=7.21. Fluid biochemical analysis was as follows: Glu=4mg/dl, L.D.H=890U/l, Amylase=28U/l, Triglycerides=34mg/dl, Cholesterol=162mg/dl, Total proteins=4.54gr/dl, Albumin=2.23gr/dl, Globulins=2.31gr/dl, A.D.A.=19IU/L. On microscopic examination highly characteristic diamond shaped cholesterol crystals were observed (Fig. 2 ). Based on the milky macroscopic appearance, the characteristic cholesterol crystals and the high cholesterol along with the low triglycerides levels, the diagnosis of pseudochylothorax was reached. Findings of chest computed tomography (CT) were consistent with those of the chest X-ray, with left encapsulated pleural effusion and unilateral calcified wall, restricted fibrotic lesions and reduced left lung volume with significant shift of mediastinum and compensatory hyperventilation of the right lung (Fig. 3 ). CT findings were indicative of left trapped lung, so drainage of the pleural effusion through a chest tube was avoided. Alternatively, therapeutic thoracentesis was preformed, resulting in drainage of 1000ml of pleural fluid and immediate relief of symptoms. Ziehl-Nielsen stain and amplification molecular test for M. tuberculosis of the pleural fluid sample were both positive. Immunological tests for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were negative. Thus, the diagnosis of pleural TB was established as the cause of the pseudochylothorax and treatment with 1st line antiTB treatment (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) was initiated. The patient was discharged and has been followed up as an outpatient. Later, pleural fluid culture in Lowenstein-Jensen medium also proved to be positive, whereas the drug susceptibility test confirmed a strain susceptible to all 1st line antiTB drugs. Pleural drainage was repeated twice during next months of antiTB treatment, due to symptomatic increase of pleural effusion. The patient was further evaluated for surgical management but absence of remarkable symptoms made him unwilling to proceed. ",0
5932,S0041134503009217,Primary tuberculosis 1 year after conversion from azathioprine to mycophenolate in recipient kidney transplantation: a case report," Case report A 26-year-old man with renal failure secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis received a kidney transplant from his father in June 1993, after 6 years of hemodialysis. His postoperative course was uneventful leader treatment with AZA and prednisone. Seven years later he was admitted due to a moderate increase in serum creatinine level. Renal biopsy revealed chronic allograft dysfunction. The patient was converted to MMF (2 g/d) and AZA was stopped. In March 2000, he was treated for enterococus septicemia. In July 2001, 1 year after conversion from AZA to MMF, he was admitted to the hospital due to prolonged irregular fever with weight loss and cough. Physical examination was unremarkable and chest radiograph was normal. Pulmonary infection was treated routinely with no result. Finally tuberculosis was diagnosed by demonstration of acid fast bacilli in the sputum. Quadruple antitubercular therapy was given for 3 months, which included isoniazid 300 mg/d, rifampicin 600 mg/d, ethambutol 1 g/d, and pyrazinamide 1.5 g/d followed by dual therapy for 4 months (Isoniazid plus Rifampicin). At this stage the patient was asymptomatic with stable renal function. One month after stopping treatment he was readmitted with fever and asthenia. It was diagnosed to represent reactivation of tuberculosis. The antituberculous treatment was restarted and the patient became afebrile after 4 days. ",0
