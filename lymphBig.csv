-1,S2210-2612(18)30035-X,Primary splenic malignant lymphoma mimicking metastasis of rectosigmoid cancer: A case report," 2 Case presentation A previously healthy 80-year-old man visited our hospital for evaluation of elevated biliary enzyme levels in November 2016. He had no symptoms, such as fever, weight loss and night sweats. Laboratory tests demonstrated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 471?U/dL (normal 105–340?U/dL) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 570?U/L (normal 110–230?U/L). The serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were 62.5?ng/mL (normal 0–5?ng/mL) and 452.4?U/mL (normal 0–37?U/mL), respectively. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed rectosigmoidal wall thickening in the pelvis, a liver tumor in segment 5/6, splenic tumors (Fig. 1 a), and a left lung tumor. The left lung tumor, located in segment 10, presented pure ground-glass opacification with pleural indentation. Colonoscopy showed a type 2 rectosigmoid tumor, 45?mm in size, located 15?cm from the anal verge. Examination of biopsy specimens of the rectosigmoid tumor revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography with 2[18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG-PET) revealed a rectosigmoid cancer with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 11.6, a left lung tumor with a SUVmax of 3.1, a liver tumor and splenic tumors with excessive uptake values, consistent with the CT scan findings. There were no excessive uptake values in the thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes. These findings led to a preoperative diagnosis of advanced rectosigmoid cancer with liver and splenic metastases and primary left lung cancer. Therefore, the patient first underwent single-incision laparoscopic high anterior rectosigmoid resection in December 2016. Examination of the surgical specimen revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma penetrating the serosa, with regional lymph node metastases. Six courses of XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) plus panitumumab chemotherapy were administered after rectosigmoid cancer surgery. CT scan performed after chemotherapy demonstrated significant reduction in size of the hepatic and splenic tumors (Fig. 1b), although the tumor in segment 10 of the left lung had enlarged. On dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T1-weighted imaging showed a signal-hypointense mass in segment 3 of the liver, in addition to the already-known tumor in segment 5/6 (Fig. 2 ). The serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 decreased to 8.3?ng/mL and 7.7?U/mL, respectively. In May 2017, the patient underwent laparoscopy-assisted splenectomy and open partial hepatectomy of segment 3 and segment 5/6 of the liver. First, the spleen was mobilized from the retroperitoneum using the three-port laparoscopic technique (Fig. 3 ). After mobilization of the spleen, a J-shaped subcostal incision was made and splenectomy and partial hepatectomy of segment 3 and segment 5/6 of the liver were performed. Intraoperative evaluation showed no lymph node swelling in the abdominal cavity. Pathological findings of the liver tumors were compatible with metastases of rectosigmoid cancer. Macroscopically, the splenic tumors were whiter and firmer than liver tumors (Fig. 4 ). Microscopically, the splenic tumors demonstrated a diffuse proliferation of large lymphoid cells that were composed of diffusely proliferating atypical cells with irregular medium, to large round or oval nuclei and a high nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) ratio (Fig. 5 ). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for the B-cell marker CD20, but not for CD3, CD5, and CD10. The Ki-67 index was 80–90% (Fig. 6 ). Therefore, the splenic tumor was diagnosed as a diffuse B-cell lymphoma. These findings led to a final diagnosis of advanced rectosigmoid cancer with multiple liver metastases of T4aN0M1a stage IVA, and primary splenic high grade B-cell lymphoma stage I, according to Ahmann [1] and Ann Arbor [3] staging. During the 3-months follow-up period, the patient continued to do well without any signs of recurrence or metastasis of rectosigmoid cancer and malignant lymphoma, and hence, curative resection of the lung cancer was considered as the next treatment.

0,S1319-4534(18)30026-2,Isolated superior oblique muscle extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma: case report," Case report A 42-year-old female presented to the oculoplastic clinic complaining of redness in the left eye associated with progressive proptosis over one year. She is known case of diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, and cardiac disease. Ophthalmic examination indicated a visual acuity of 20/40 and intraocular pressure of 19?mmHg bilaterally. The left eye showed proptosis (exophthalmometry measurements at base 105 were 16?mm in the right eye (OD) and 20?mm in the left eye (OS)). She had a conjunctival injection, upper lid ptosis (MRD1 4?mm OD and 2?mm OS) and ocular motility limitation. Other aspects of the examination including the anterior segment, optic disc and fundus were within normal limits in both eyes. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the orbit indicated an isolated enlargement of the left superior oblique (SO) muscle, that appeared as a fusiform muscle enlargement from its tendinous origin just before its attachment to the trochlear fossa of the frontal bone in the upper medial aspect of the orbit along with the muscle belly. The mass lesion had an intermediate signal intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images and intense enhancement following intravenous injection of contrast media with diffusion-weighted Image onb?=?1000 andb?=?0 sequences. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was (0.77?±?0.11?×?10?3 mm2/s) determined by the manual region-of-interest intensity with diffusion pattern relatively low signal intensity within the lesion compared to that of brain parenchyma. There was no evidence of infiltration of the adjacent superior rectus and medial rectus muscles with normal surrounding fat (Fig. 1 ). Laboratory tests were normal including complete blood count (CBC), thyroid function test, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and autoimmune serology. However, the Mantoux test (purified protein derivative; PPD) was positive. Incisional biopsy under general anaesthesia was planned. On exploration, left SO muscle belly was enlarged and inflamed with dilated and tortuous engorged blood vessels were along its tendon. A biopsy was taken from SO muscle belly. The histopathologic section showed muscle fibers separated by diffuse proliferation of small round cells with dark nuclei and minimal cytoplasm representing mature lymphocytes. Occasional larger lymphoid cells and some plasma cells were also present (Fig. 2 ). Immunohistochemical staining showed a predominant infiltrate of B-lymphocytes that was CD20, CD43 and Bcl-2 positive and CD10, CD30 and Bcl-6 negative (Fig. 3 ). In addition, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was positive. Hence the pathological diagnosis was extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma. After reaching the final diagnosis, the patient was referred to a general hospital with an oncology center for a full metastatic workup to exclude systemic disease and management. "
1,S1052-3057(17)30450-0,Granulomatous Angiitis of the Central Nervous System Associated with Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Case Report and Literature Review," Case Presentation A 25-year-old woman reported a 1-year history of intermittent headaches. She then developed speech difficulty with word substitution and dysnomia. A neurological examination showed mixed aphasia but was otherwise nonfocal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium demonstrated large confluent white matter hyperintensities with multifocal, punctate perivascular enhancement (Fig 1, A-C ). Cerebrospinal fluid revealed elevated proteins at 57?mg/dL (normal range, 15-45?mg/dL), glucose of 42?mg/dL, red blood cell count of 2/µL, and white blood cell count of 26/µL (normal range, 0-5 leukocytes/µL); opening pressure was 25 cmH2O, with normal cytology. Cerebrospinal fluid bacterial culture, Lyme screen, venereal disease research laboratory test, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein–Barr virus polymerase chain reaction were negative. Paraneoplastic autoantibodies, antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, and urine toxicology screen were negative. A large painless, lymph node was palpated in the left supraclavicular area. PET CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed mediastinal hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy including paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes (Fig 2 ). A right axillary lymph node was biopsied, and pathological analysis was consistent with classic HL and nodular sclerosis subtype (Fig 3, A ). The patient underwent a stealth-guided left medial frontal brain biopsy to rule out concomitant infection or comorbid disease prior to proceeding with chemotherapy. Histopathology revealed GACNS (Fig 3, B,C). At 20 months' follow-up, and after 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide for GACNS and 6 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the underlying HL, the patient showed remarkable neurological, particularly language, function and independence as well as radiographic improvement (Fig 1, D-F).

2,S2213-0071(17)30385-4,Peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) presenting as an endobronchial lesion: Case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 68-year-old Japanese male was indicated a chest radiographic abnormality in the right upper lung field by routine health check-up. One month later, a right chest pain occurred, and he was diagnosed with right upper lobe pneumonia at the previous hospital. Despite antibiotic treatment, chest radiographic abnormality got worse and he was referred to our hospital for more thorough examinations. The patient was a current smoker with a 24-pack-year history of smoking. He had no medical history. His vital signs were within the normal limits. A general physical examination revealed an enlarged lymph node in the right axillary region. His lymph node was firm, unmovable and non-tender and measured 3.0?×?3.0 cm. A chest X-ray showed consolidation in the right upper lung field (Fig. 1 ). Contrast-enhanced whole-body computed tomography (CT) disclosed a right axillary lymphadenopathy and a right hilar mass with obstruction of the main bronchus (Fig. 2 ). 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) revealed an abnormal FDG accumulation in the subcutaneous nodules on the mandibular and left chest wall, a part of the trachea, lymph nodes (submandibular, right axillary and mediastinal), right hilar mass, retroperitoneal mass and mass in the right femoral muscle with high metabolic activity (SUVmax: 5.75–21.1) (Fig. 3 ). Bronchoscopy showed a white, moss-like appearance of the trachea just below the glottis and right B3 entrance stenosis with a large amount of purulent discharge (Fig. 4 ). A transbronchial biopsy (TBB) was performed on both lesions, and atypical medium-to large-sized cells were found arranged in nests with marked lymphocyte infiltration. An immunohistochemical study revealed focal positive staining for CD3, CD8, TIA-1, and CC chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4), and negative staining for CD4, CD20, and EBV (Fig. 5 A and B). In addition, a biopsy of the subcutaneous nodules on the left chest wall also showed the same findings (Fig. 5C and D). A bone marrow biopsy showed hypoplastic marrow, and invasion of lymphoma was not suspected. From these results, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVA PTCL-NOS, and chemotherapy was started. The chemotherapy regimen included cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP therapy). Grade 4 neutropenia and Grade 1 thrombocytopenia were observed during the treatment. After five cycles of chemotherapy, contrast-enhanced whole-body CT showed a reduction in the right hilar mass and all of the lymph nodes (right axillary, mental, submandibular, cervical, subcarinal, splenic hilar and retroperitoneal region) (Fig. 6 ), with a partial response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). After six courses of CHOP, contrast whole-body CT revealed an enlargement of the tumor mass in the right hilum, and salvage chemotherapy (CHASE therapy: cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, etoposide, and dexamethasone) was started. The patient ultimately died because of septic shock after undergoing three courses of CHASE therapy. "
3,S2210-2612(18)30182-2,Massive splenomegaly due to B-cell lymphoma: A case report," 2 Case report A 53- year old, previously healthy man, presented with malaise, weight loss of 30?kg in 8 months, mild dyspnea and cervical lymphadenopathy. He was a former smoker. Other than that, his medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, he had a palpable massive spleen reaching 4?cm under spina iliaca anterior superior and crossing the midline 8?cm to the right side. He also had mild hepatomegaly with no signs of free fluid in abdominal cavity. On right side of neck, there was 10?x?8?cm large solid lymph node aggregate. He also had mild pleural effusion. Laboratoy results showed pancytopenia and elevated level of LDH (10,8?mmol/L). CT scan revealed a massive spleen (Fig. 1 ), moderately enlarged liver, enlarged retroperitoneal and upper mediastinal lymph nodes. Aspiration biopsy of cervical lymph nodes was performed and set the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. Patient was advised to proceede with splenectomy in order to prevent possible trombosis of abdominal veins due to compression of massive spleen. At first, patient rejected the operative treatment, but changed his mind later. Preoperatively he was vaccinated with Pneumovax, Haemophilus B and meningococcal vaccine. On the day of operation patient was placed in right lateral decubitus position. Upper midline incision was made and extended in left subcostal incision in order to gain access. Mobilisation of spleen began with dissection of splenocolic, phrenicosplenic, gastrosplenic ligaments and short gastric arteries. Splenic artery was covered with fibrous material and ended in splenic hylum which was also fibrotic and thickened. Splenic vessels and hylum were divided with 60?mm vascular stapler. After that spleen was removed from abdomen (Fig. 2 ), CH 21 abdominal drain was inserted in the left upper quadrant. The resected spleen weighed 5034?g, measured 33?×?24?x?10?cm and comprised 6% of patient body weight (preoperatively 81?kg). Upon histological analysis, spleen was completely infiltrated with confluating nodes of whitish grey tissue. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. First postoperative day patient started receiving antibiotic prophylaxis with Penicillin 1000?mg/12?h which will be continued for two years. On fifth postoperative day patient was transferred to oncology department, where he received 5 cycluses of R-CHOP chemotherapy and 2 cycluses of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy in the following months respectively.

4,S2213-0071(18)30283-1,Crazy paving pattern as a rare radiological manifestation of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with lung involvement: A case report," 2 Discussion We report a rare case of PTCL presenting with an unusual radiologic manifestation of that of crazy paving pattern. The term crazy-paving pattern refers to an image of ground glass opacities with superimposed thickening of interlobular septal lines. Although it is considered typical of alveolar proteinosis the actual differential is wide including infections (pneumocystis jirovecii, viral), sanguineous causes (pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage), interstitial lung diseases (organizing pneumonia, exogenous lipoid pneumonia), malignancy (adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth, lymphatic spread of the tumor) [1]. Although the causes of this pattern are frequently indistinguishable at radiologic evaluation, incorporating data from history and clinical examination (e.g. immune status, acute vs chronic symptoms, history of cancer etc) as well as differences in the location of the characteristic attenuation in the lungs is crucial for suggesting the appropriate diagnosis [2]. PTCL, a subgroup of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, is a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder from post-thymic (peripheral T-cells) or mature NK cells [3]. PTCL accounts for less than 15% of all NHLs in the United States and Europe but they are more frequent in the Far East [4,5]. PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS) is the most common group of PTCL and it includes cases that do not correspond to any specific subtype [5,6].Despite aggressive chemotherapy, the majority of patients with most subtypes of PTCL have unfavorable prognosis [7]. The IPI score, including age greater than 60 years, stage III or IV disease according to Ann Arbor staging system, elevated serum LDH, ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 2, 3, or 4 and more than one extranodal site, is the most established prognostic factor, but newer prognostic models have also been proposed [8,9]. Patients with PTCL present predominantly with nodal disease, but extranodal disease is often present, with skin being the most common extranodal site [10].Pulmonary involvement is relatively rare; its frequency has been assessed from 2% to 8% of the cases, while extrapulmonary manifestations in the form of pleural effusions are present in 3%–12% of the individuals with this disorder [6,10]. The chest imaging findings of PTCL have not been well characterized [11]. It should be noted that imaging findings are frequently non-specific and require correlation with clinical findings. However, the radiologist is often the first one to suggest the diagnosis. Common CT findings include nodules or consolidation, cavitation (in aggressive forms) as well as hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy [12]. Lewis et al. evaluated CT findings of 31 patients with lung lymphoma and reported that the most frequent finding was a mass/masslike consolidation larger than 1 cm, while the second most common was nodules less than 1cm.The authors did not report any patient with crazy paving pattern in the chest CT [13]. Fu et al. (2016) reported a rare case of pneumothorax as first manifestation of PTCL [14]. Three case reports exist concerning crazy paving pattern of PTCL with lung involvement [15–17]. Recently, Aqeel et al. reported a rare case of acute respiratory failure in the setting of antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) in a patient with PTCL where the chest CT revealed extensive bilateral ground glass opacities [18].

5,S1878-8750(17)31757-6,Primary Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in a Patient with Rubinstein–Taybi Syndrome: Case Report and Review of the Literature," Case Report  History and Physical Examination A 36-year-old male patient with RSTS presented with a 1-month history of severe headaches and progressive lethargy. Although the patient was nonverbal at baseline with significant cognitive delay, his parents became concerned when they noticed frequent episodes of head holding and growing disinterest with his usual activities. On examination, he was found to have preserved motor strength in all 4 extremities as well as equal, reactive pupils bilaterally. Aside from behavioral changes, as noted previously, no overt deficits were discernible. A noncontrast computed tomography scan of the head revealed a 7.0-cm × 4.7-cm hyperdense lesion in the right cerebral hemisphere causing severe mass effect and resulting in approximately 13 mm of leftward midline shift (Figure 1 ). Subsequently, MRI of the brain with contrast revealed a homogenously enhancing mass (Figure 2 ) that was slightly hypointense on a precontrast T1 and isointense on T2 when compared with surrounding gray matter. The tumor did exhibit some mild restricted diffusion. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast were negative for a primary malignancy.   Operation/Pathology/Postoperative Course The patient underwent an image-guided, right frontotemporal craniotomy for tumor resection. Intraoperatively, the nonvascular tumor appeared intercalated with the dura. A frozen sample was sent and came back consistent with a small blue cell tumor or lymphoma. Given the pathologic diagnosis based on the frozen sample, a partial debulking was performed, and the craniotomy was completed with no complications. Multiple samples were sent for permanent pathology. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 2 with no new neurologic deficits. The pathology report identified the tumor as a DLBCL and, given involvement of the dura, was favored to be of the germinal center immunophenotype (Figure 3 ). Examined cells expressed CD20 (Figure 4 ), CD45, BCL6, and BCL2. CD3 testing highlighted background small T cells. Approximately 20% of the cells stained positive for C-MYC. There was notable lack of staining for CD10, MUM-1, NFP, IDH1, PPH3, pancytokeratin, and synaptophysin. Epstein–Barr encoding region in situ hybridization was also negative. The patient was started on R-MVP therapy (rituximab/methotrexate/vincristine/procarbazine) 1 month postoperatively, with a complete radiographic response noted 5 months after initial diagnosis, before completion of R-MVP (Figure 5 ). Consolidation therapy with R-CHOP (rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) was initiated 7 months after his initial presentation, with no neurologic deficit or tumor recurrence.

6,S1930-0433(17)30135-8,Primary hepatic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in a patient with no chronic liver disease: Case report," Case report A 47-year-old woman was referred to our department for an incidentally focal liver mass found on a routine ultrasound examination. The patient had an unremarkable medical history. The only clinical symptom described by the patient was fatigue. The physical examination at presentation did not reveal any abnormalities. The laboratory tests showed the following: alanine aminotransferase: 18 U/L (normal, 14-54 U/L), aspartate transaminase: 22 U/L (normal, 15-41 U/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase: 29 U/L (normal, 7-50 U/L), alpha-fetoprotein: 8 ng/mL, normal blood cell counts, coagulation, and protein electrophoresis. Serological examinations for HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. The ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic hepatic lesion in segment IV, without any other abdominal abnormalities. Imagistic investigations, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. Nonenhanced CT showed a slightly hypodense focal mass in segment IVA of the liver, measuring 85/50 mm in diameter (A). On contrast-enhanced CT, there was no enhancement of the lesion on arterial, portal, or delayed phase. The vessels were not invaded; the vessels pass through the mass without having their vascular paths modified, although their caliber was slightly reduced, indicating the infiltrative pattern of the lesion (Fig. 1C , yellow arrows). Based on the clinical and radiological findings, the lesion was first described as a benign entity (focal steatosis or hepatic pseudolesion). MRI showed a solitary, well-defined focal mass occupying segment IVA, measuring 85/50 mm in diameter, moderately hypointense T1, and hyperintense T2 fat suppressed (Fig. 2 ). The hepatic lesion showed an intense restriction of diffusion on diffusion-weighted images (Fig. 3 ). There was no drop of signal on in and out of phase images, which made the diagnosis of focal steatosis unlikely. After contrast administration, the lesion remained hypointense on all phases (Fig. 4 ). CT and MRI examinations showed that there were no enlarged abdominal lymph nodes and no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation. The hepatic mass was first described as a benign hepatic lesion, even though, at second opinion, the suspicion of lymphoma was raised. Therefore, the patient decided to undergo surgery first without prior biopsy irrespective of the medical management of the lymphoma. Intraoperative biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoma. The histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed hepatic MALT lymphoma positive for CD 20 and negative for CD 5, BCL6, cyclin D1, and CD 23. Bone marrow biopsy and gastric endoscopy were normal. The patient underwent R-CHOP-based regimen chemotherapy, which consisted of 6 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone. At 6 and 9 months, respectively, after surgery, the contrast-enhanced CT and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) demonstrated no lymph node involvement confirming the diagnosis of primary hepatic MALT lymphoma (Fig. 5 ).

7,S2352-5789(17)30111-X,"Primary, non-germinal center, double-expressor diffuse large B cell lymphoma confined to a uterine leiomyoma: A case report"," 2 Case report A 69-year-old white female was referred to gynecologic oncology for an incidental finding of a complex ovarian mass on CT scan for follow-up of pulmonary nodules. It was described as a complex right adnexal cyst measuring 6.8cm with cystic and fatty components consistent with a dermoid cyst without evidence of lymphadenopathy. Uterine fibroids were noted (Fig. 1 ). Her past medical history was significant for type II diabetes mellitus and intermittent atrial fibrillation, controlled on Glimepiride and Metoprolol, respectively. She had a small bowel resection with primary reanastomosis for microperforation of small bowel mesentery 2years previously. Pathology showed small bowel necrosis and abscess consistent with perforation. Three lymph nodes were benign with no evidence of lymphoma. On presentation, she was without complaint. She denied abdominopelvic pain or bloating, postmenopausal bleeding, early satiety, unintentional weight loss and changes in bowel or bladder habits. On exam, she was afebrile and her BMI was 24.8kg/m2. Her abdomen was non-tender. On bimanual exam, her uterus was 9cm with irregular contour and a mobile, non-tender 8cm mass was noted in the right adnexa. Her Ca-125 was 33U/mL. Complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) were normal. Pap smear was negative for intraepithelial lesion. The differential diagnoses, including benign verses malignant ovarian neoplasm and uterine fibroids with remote chance of malignancy, and options for surgical management including unilateral or bilateral adnexectomy with or without hysterectomy were discussed with the patient. She opted for total robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Surgical findings included a smooth, 8cm right ovarian mass, normal left adnexa, and a fibroid uterus with one large, smooth anterior pedunculated uterine mass. Grossly, the uterine mass was a 136-gram, 10.0×8.0×5.8cm, white-tan whorled nodule. Sectioning revealed a 2.5cm focal area of degeneration. Frozen section showed benign uterine fibroid with myxoid changes. "
8,S2214-3300(18)30073-7,Richter transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma to composite diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and hodgkin lymphoma: a case report and review of literature," 2 Case report An 82-year-old female with a remote history of breast cancer treated with mastectomy, radiation and chemotherapy first presented in 2016 with an asymptomatic lymphocytosis. Flow cytometry performed on peripheral blood demonstrated a monoclonal B cell population that is positive for CD20 (dim), CD5, CD23 and surface lambda and was diagnosed as CLL/SLL. Additional cytogenetic/FISH analysis revealed deletion of 13q and 17p. IgVH was mutated. CT scan showed small-volume periportal, retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy, consistent with Rai stage 0. No therapy was initiated at that time. One year after the initial diagnosis, in 2017, she presented with rapidly increased lymphocytosis and found to have FGD-avid diffuse lymphadenopathy including axillary, mediastinal, hilar, intra-abdominal and pelvic areas as demonstrated on PET/CT scan. She remained asymptomatic and had excellent performance status. She underwent a left axillary lymph node excisional biopsy for pathologic evaluation. The biopsy showed an enlarged lymph node (5.5?cm) with nodal architecture completely effaced by a predominant population of small atypical cells with round nuclei, clumped chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, scant cytoplasm and low mitotic activity (Fig. 1 , A). A series of well controlled immunohistochemical stains demonstrated that these cells are positive for dim CD20, PAX5, CD5, CD23 and BCL2; and negative for CD3, BCL6, CD10, MYC, MUM-1, CD30 and CD15. Proliferation index, as measured by Ki-67, is approximately 20% (Fig. 2 , upper left of the juxtaposing figure). These morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are of small lymphocytic lymphoma. Scattered throughout and closely admixed with small lymphocytes a population of large atypical cells with folded nuclei, open chromatin, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm, morphologically resembling Reed-Sternberg cells (Fig. 1 D). Many binucleate Reed-Sternberg forms are also seen. No fibrosis or increased eosinophils is identified. These cells are positive for PAX5 (dim), EBER, CD30, and CD15 (subset), consistent a Hodgkin lymphoma (Fig. 3 ). Sharply demarcated from these areas (Fig. 1, A), a few diffuse areas were identified that are composed of intermediate-to-large cells with irregular nuclei, open chromatin, small nucleoli, scant cytoplasm and high mitotic index. Karyorrhexis is prominent in these areas with numerous tingible body macrophages creating a classic ‘starry sky’ pattern (Fig. 1, C). In contrast to other areas, these large cells are distinctively reactive for bright CD20, bright PAX5, BCL6, MYC, MUM1, and CD10; and are negative for CD3, BCL2, CD30, and CD15. Ki-67 proliferation index marker highlighted >90% of cells. In situ hybridization for EBV–encoded RNA transcript (EBER) is positive in most large cells (Fig. 2, lower right). FISH study for MYC gene rearrangement is negative. The diagnosis of morphologic transformation of CLL/SLL was made and. The patient received 6?cycles of R-CHOP as standard therapy for Richter transformation. "
10,S2090-0740(16)30095-0,An unusual presentation of nasofacial NK/T-cell lymphoma – A case report," 2 Case report A 56years old man presented with a small ulcerative lesion over the dorsum of nose 3months back. The lesion progressively increased its dimension with dry and necrotic appearance to present one (Fig. 1 ). On examination, a crust covered mass seen over the midline nasofacial area. There was no lymphadenopathy. There was no history of nasal bleeding, hyposmia, post nasal drip or cough. Routine blood test did not reveal any relevant findings and fine needle aspiration cytology was inconclusive. Urine analysis, liver function tests, renal function test were normal except raised ESR. HIV-ELISA and HbsAg tests were showing negative reports. Computed tomography (CT scan) of nose and sinus demonstrated the presence of extensive destruction of soft tissue and nasal septum (Fig. 2 ). A biopsy was taken from the lesion and sent for histopathological examination. The histopathological examination was showing a diffuse lymphomatous infiltrates with angiocentric and angiodestructive pattern (Fig. 3 ). Extensive area of necrosis with infiltration of plasma cells, histiocytes and eosinophils are present along with atypical lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry(IHC) study showed abnormal lymphocytes of CD56, CD3 and CD4 (Fig. 4 ). The patient is referred to Hemato-Oncology department for further treatment and he received multidrug chemotherapy of four cycles (CHOP regimen).Then he got external beam irradiation(36Gy).Patient got symptomatically improvement after 3months of treatment.

11,S2314-808X(17)30370-6,Primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A case report," 2 Case report A 47 years old male presented with three month history of left testicular swelling. No B-symptoms were present. The patients underwent unilateral (left) orchiectomy. Histopathology revealed extensive involvement and replacement of testicular parenchyma by a tumor composed of large discohesive sheets of cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Necrotic foci were also identified. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed the following reactivity pattern in tumor cells: positivity for LCA & Pan B (CD20) and negativity for OCT 3/4, SALL4 and Inhibin. Moreover, Pan T (CD3) highlighted reactive T-cells. All these features rendered the diagnosis of DLBCL according to WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms (see Fig. 1  and Table 1 ). To accurately assess the disease extension and evaluate the stage, FDG PET/CT was performed which demonstrated two para-aortic FDG avid lymph nodes on the left side at the level of L2 vertebra, as shown in Fig. 2 . The range of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was up to 9.79 and size of 1.1?×?1.5?cm along the left external iliac vessel. FDG avid lymph nodes were also seen with SUVmax ranges up to 5.65 and subcentimeter in size. Faint FDG uptake was seen along the surgical tract, possibly because of post-surgical changes. Soft tissue density lesion was seen in the upper part of the scrotal sac with SUV ranging up to 5.98 and subcentimeter in size. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status for the patient was zero, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated (303?U/L) and international prognostic index (IPI) score was zero, signifying the low risk of the disease. Consequently, the clinical stage of the disease was Stage IIAE. "
13,S2214-5419(17)30016-0,MALT Lymphoma occurring in the maxillofacial region: A review of the literature and case report," 2 Presentation of case We report a case of a 26-year-old female who visited our department in June, 2015. She presented a tumor in soft palate that she reported a year ago. Two years before, she had been treated for sialolithiasis in the right parotid and submaxilar glands in another center. The size of the soft palate bulk didn’t suffer any modification throughout the day or while eating. In fact, she didn’t refer any local or systemic symptoms. As previous diseases, when she was 13-years old she was diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome and had been followed by a Rheumatologist since then. The patient presented bilateral upper palpebral ptosis and an increased size of right parotid gland (Fig. 1 ). Physical examination confirmed a fixed mass of elastic consistency and 3 × 2 cm in size on soft palate without bleeding or ulceration (Fig. 2 ) The rest of physical examination had no relevant findings. A biopsy of the mass was performed. The Pathologist reported a “diffuse infiltration by medium-size lymphocytes, lymphoepithelial lesions and growth centers” (Fig. 3 ) consistent with the diagnosis of a Low-B-grade MALT Lymphoma type. Inmunohistochemistry was positive for Bcl-2, CD20 and CD79? antigens and negative for CD3 and CD5 (Fig. 4 ). Proliferative index (MIB-1) was 30%. The body-CT-scan, showed no systemic abnormalities. Locally, it was described an anomalous parenchyma of both submandibular glands and enlarged parotid glands with microcalcifications and cysts inside in congruency with Sjögren's Syndrome. The mass on soft palate was circumscribed to mucous membrane without affecting the bone. A gastroscopy and bone marrow aspirate dismissed the possibility of distance dissemination. According to the modification of the scale of Ann Arbor by Lugano, stage I was compatible with the initial diagnosis. The patient was referred to the Hematology Department in order to begin systemic treatment. Secondary to the low initial stage of the lesion, they decided to start monotherapy with Rituximab [4,5]. After 1 month of therapy and four cycles of rituximab, the patient was remitted again to our department to evaluate the lesion in the soft palate. The lesion had significantly decreased in size after chemotherapy with rituximab so we decided watchful-waiting (Figs. 5–6  ). After 2 months, the lesion didn’t disappear so we decided to rebiopsy it. The Pathologist reported the lesion as persistent low-grade MALT lymphoma. Subsequently, the haematologist changed the therapy to R-Bendamustine. The patient received 8 cycles in total. A control head and neck PET- CT scan was performed in 12 weeks after end of Chemotherapy and no remaining disease was found (Fig. 7 ). At present and after two years since diagnosed (May, 2015–February, 2017), the patient is disease-free. "
14,S0041-1345(18)30581-5,Living Kidney Donor With Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma at the Time of Donation: A Case Report," Case Report A 53-year-old woman was referred to our hospital to donate a kidney to her son. She had a medical history of hypertension and a fatty liver, but no prior history of malignancy. Her eligibility as a donor was screened in a series of medical examinations, including a computed tomography (CT) scan, a mammogram, a gastroscopy, a colonoscopy, and a pap smear. No relevant or suspicious signs of malignancy were noted in these screenings. Although preoperative CT showed a small lymph node swelling at the left renal hilum (Fig 1 ), we performed laparoscopic donor nephrectomy based on the diagnosis of an insignificant enlarged lymph node. We recognized the small lymph node adjacent to the left renal hilar ganglion during the operation, and performed a lymphadenectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful, other than subileus. Postoperatively, a pathologic examination of the small lymph node revealed SLL with CD23 and CD5 expressions. The hematologist suggested observation without treatment, because the disease was stage A of the Binet system for SLL, and the early stage of SLL is considered to be slow-growing lymphoma. However, 5 months after the donor nephrectomy, a progressive enlarged lymph node appeared in the right intraorbital lesion (Fig 2 ), which may cause an ocular movement disorder in the future. It also became clear that the donor had already recognized intraorbital tumor before the donor nephrectomy. To date, the donor has been treated with 4 cycles of 375mg/m2 of anti-CD20 antibodies per week. Subsequently, no relevant signs of progression were noted as of 1 year after the nephrectomy. The recipient was a 31-year-old man with end-stage renal disease of IgA nephropathy. Immunosuppressive therapy was intensively inducted with anti-CD20 antibodies, anti-CD25 antibodies, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids because of the ABO-incompatible transplantation. The postoperative course was uneventful, and there has been no evidence of transmission of lymphoproliferative disorder as of 1 year after the transplantation. "
18,S2214-7519(17)30014-2,Treatment and long-term follow-up of primary CNS classical Hodgkin's lymphoma – A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case presentation A 47-year-old woman presented with two sudden-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures as a first time presentation. She underwent CT and MRI scans of her brain, which showed a 15mm dural-based, ring-enhancing lesion overlying her left parietal lobe, with significant edema (see Figs. 1 and 2  ). Neurological examination was normal, as was routine bloodwork (routine electrolyte and complete blood count parameters) taken at the time. She was started on Dexamethasone 4mg TID, and remained on it for two weeks in anticipation of her operation. A one month post-operative MRI scan showed no residual enhancing tumour (see Fig. 3 ). On history, she endorsed some subtle forgetfulness and confusion the morning of her presentation, needing prompting for some routine activities of daily living. She denied any recent illness or constitutional symptoms. Her only significant past medical history was remarkable for dermatomyositis, for which she had been receiving methotrexate treatment the past five years. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, along with a mammogram were performed to investigate for a primary source of malignancy and metastases. All investigations were negative, and the patient was prepared for surgical resection of the tumour. The 3.2×1.5×1.3cm tumour was successfully resected through a navigational image-guided craniotomy without complication, and was histologically described as a mixed proliferative tissue specimen with lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells against an eosinophilic background of fibrosis and large areas of necrosis. A Reed-Sternberg cell was clearly seen, helping solidify the diagnosis of Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Flow cytometry determined the cells to be CD3+, CD15+, CD20+, CD30+, and CD45-, with no B or T cell clonality. Over the ensuing months, several investigations were done to assess for systemic disease, as it was clear that primary Hodgkin's lymphoma of the CNS was extremely rare, and thus unlikely. These included lumbar punctures for CSF sampling and whole-body PET scanning, both of which displayed no evidence of lymphomatous disease outside the CNS. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was done, and showed megaloblastic erythropoeisis (likely secondary to the methotrexate therapy for dermatomyositis) with no evidence of infiltrative lymphoma or otherwise abnormal cytology. Her final diagnosis was determined to be Stage I AE primary CNS Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was treated with a total of 3000cGy of whole brain radiation therapy over 20 fractions, followed by a 600cGy boost over 4 additional fractions. Follow-up subsequently took place with radiation oncology through Cancer Care Manitoba for the next seven years, where she did very well, with no symptoms nor evidence of lymphoma recurrence. At the point of 88months from initial diagnosis, she was considered essentially cured and discharged from further follow-up. Now a total of 110months from her initial diagnosis, she remains well with no symptoms attributable to her lymphoma. "
19,S2352-5789(18)30103-6,A case of primary cervical lymphoma in a patient with abnormal uterine bleeding," 2 Case presentation Patient presented as a 55-year-old woman who had never ceased menses. She developed daily spotting 4?months prior to presentation. One month prior to presentation, she experienced an episode of heavy bleeding with passage of clots and was referred to a gynecologist for further evaluation. Transvaginal ultrasound showed poor visualization of the uterus and MRI was obtained. The uterus was atrophic. Her cervix was enlarged with abnormal stromal signal that was read as highly worrisome for cervical malignancy. The widest cervical diameter was measured at 5.6?cm. There was no adenopathy, stranding or thickened parametria. Endometrial biopsy was non-diagnostic and patient was referred for gynecologic oncology evaluation. A pap smear was normal, though no transformation zone noted, and HPV testing was not performed. On physical examination, a left labial cyst was noted and the patient reported that it had been present for several years. The cervix was posterior and difficult to visualize on speculum examination. On bimanual exam, the cervix was barrel-shaped and uterus was non-palpable. Her parametria were smooth and ovaries free from masses. Patient underwent an exam under anesthesia (EUA), cervical biopsies, and dilation and curettage. On EUA, the cervix was 10?cm in diameter. Pathology showed lymphoma and immunohistochemistry was consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DCBCL) with high mitotic index on both the cervical biopsies and curettings. Post-procedure evaluation included PET/CT which was negative for metastatic disease (Fig. 1 ), but did show marked uptake at the cervix consistent with known malignancy (Fig. 2 ). Bone marrow biopsy was normal. The patient was initiated on standard DCBCL multi-agent chemotherapy with cyclophosphosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with rutiximab (R-CHOP). After cycle 1, she continued to have a markedly enlarged cervix on examination. After cycle 3, the cervix had only minimally decreased in size. The medical oncologist was quite concerned that the size of the cervix had not significantly changed on exam and recommended surgical resection, as it was felt the tumor should have had a better response to chemotherapy. Plan was made for hysterectomy and patient underwent laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without complication. Final pathology showed no residual lymphoma and was otherwise benign. Inflammation and lymphocytic infiltrate without evidence of large B-cell component or fibrosis was noted on the pathologic report (Fig. 3 ). Following surgery, the patient underwent a post-treatment PET/CT which was negative for disease. She then completed surveillance CT scans every 6?months for a total of two years. This was in addition to regular office visits and physical exams. We are happy to announce that the patient has been free from disease for three years at time of publication. "
21,S2214-4420(16)30136-X,Solitary Renal Pelvic Lesion as the Primary Manifestation of Hodgkin Lymphoma: A Case Report," Case presentation An 85-year-old male present with incidentally found as incidental right renal pelvic mass in follow-up computed tomography (CT) post cholecystectomy due to gallbladder cancer 5 month previously. Physical examination was normal. Hematological and biochemical investigations, including a liver function profile and renal function tests, were normal. Routine urinalysis was unremarkable and urine cytology showed class III. There was no lymphadenopathy or any other mass palpated. Axial contrast-enhanced CT scan obtained a homogenous 30 × 33 mm poor enhanced mass (arrow) in the right renal pelvis (Fig. 1 ). Coronal T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image shows the low signal-intensity filling defect mass in the right renal pelvis. Diffusion weighted image (DWI) exhibits high signal intensity. According to these examinations, we diagnosed this case as right renal pelvic tumor. A right nephroureterectomy was accomplished. The specimen consisted of kidney with its an ureter and bladder cuff. The kidney measured 9.0 × 5.0 × 5.0 cm. In the renal pelvis 2.5 × 2.2 cm yellowish-white mass was included (Fig. 2 a). But on microscopic examination, the mass was located just under submucosal area of renal pelvis and did not infiltrate the renal parenchyma (Fig. 2b). And the tumor was composed of a polymorphic population of cells including many eosinophils and atypical mononuclear cells. Reed-Sternberg cells were also seen at places (Fig. 2c). Histopathology study revealed HL of renal pelvis. Immunostaining showed that the large atypical cells were positive for CD30 (ki-1) while CD3, CD5, CD10, and CD20 were negative. These features were consistent with the diagnosis of HL of mixed cellular variety. "

Historically, this condition was first reported by Gonzalez et al in 1991 as a new type of T-cell lymphoma simulating a panniculitis that was often complicated by a hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) (also known as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) 1 ; it was subsequently named SPTCL. Initially, an aggressive clinical course was observed, and therefore, an aggressive multiagent chemotherapy was advised. However, further studies showed clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypical differences between SPTCL according to the T-cell phenotype (?? or ??), with a different prognosis for each. In 2005, the World Health Organization–European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification for cutaneous lymphomas restricted the term SPTCL to ?? SPTCL. 2  In recent classifications, both SPLCT and primary cutaneous ?? T-cell lymphoma have been considered 2 distinct and definite entities."

This was associated with an on-and-off fever, night sweats, and anorexia with more than a 10-kg loss of weight over the previous 3 months. Similar lesions appeared in the back, forearm, posterior neck, and axilla. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient developed swelling of the right eye, progressively increasing in size with diplopia. On admission the patient had a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, pulse 120 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min. O2 saturation was 96% in room air. He had right eye proptosis with ecchymosis and blurring of vision. He had anterior and posterior chest wall, thigh, neck, left forearm, and antecubical fossa skin lesions that were rubbery in consistency, mobile, and not tender, with no signs of inflammation (Figure 1 ). He had bilateral cervical, right supraclavicular, bilateral axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy measuring approximately 4 cm × 3 cm, smooth, rubbery, and mobile with intact skin. He also had hepatomegaly 12 cm below the costal margin, smooth, rubbery, nontender with a blunted edge, with no rub or murmur. The patient was noted to have right face paresthesia involving the right forehead and cheek involving the fifth nerve. Other relevant investigations included a white blood cell count of 6.3 × 109/L, hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL, platelets 777 × 109/L, lactate dehydrogenase 12,040 U/L, C-reactive protein 176 mg/L, and normal liver and coagulation profile except for serum aspartate transaminase enzyme which was 139 U/L. Viral screen was negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus, and EBV. A monoclonal band was observed in the gamma region with an immunoglobulin (Ig) A level of 17.3 g/L (normal: 0.5–3 g/L) and normal IgG and IgM levels. There was an increase in urine protein of 0.54 g/d (normal: 0–0.15 g/d) and a ferritin level of 1567 ?g/L. Computed tomography findings for the brain showed soft tissue lesions within the right orbit involving the retrobulbar fat superomedially and along the optic nerve. A soft tissue mass was also identified in the right paracavernous region. Computed tomography for the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed extensive mediastinal, cervical, axillary, and paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Multiple subcutaneous enhancing solid nodules were noted at the nape of the neck and lower down at the supraclavicular region bilaterally. Also, there were multiple liver masses; the largest measuring 15.8 cm. Para-aortic iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy was also noted together with multiple solid abdominal masses. Inguinal lymph node biopsy and biopsy from skin lesions were performed; the reports were delivered after 7 days (as it demanded much work to reach a final diagnosis). During that time the patient's condition was deteriorating. The patient was started on allopurinol and then rasbiuricase, and as a monoclonal band was observed, the patient was started empirically on bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 planned for doses on day of 1, 4, 8 and day 11 together with dexamethasone 8 mg three times daily. As the patient's condition was progressing, the dexamethasone dose was increased to 20 mg twice daily; however, the patient experienced an abnormal behavior pattern, thus dexamethasone was held for 1 day. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate with a lactate dehydrogenase level > 15,000 U/L, fibrinogen dropping from 3 g/L at admission to 1.2 g/L, and an international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time starting to prolong, suggestive of a possible starting picture of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The patient received a dose of cyclophosphamide 750 mg in total, and dexamethasone was resumed at a low dose of 8 mg three times daily. Lymph node and skin lesions were reported as plasmablastic lymphoma. Lymph node and skin lesion immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed positivity for CD45 (100%), IgA, CD10, Lambda, CD38, CD138, epithelial membrane antigen, and multiple myeloma oncogene 1, with weak focal staining for Paired Box 5 (PAX-5) and >80% of cells were Ki-67 positive. Negative markers include: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD7, CD19, CD20, CD79a, CD5, CD117, CD56, CD23, Alk protein, CD30, bcl-2, bcl-6, and kappa light chain. No evidence of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and MYC were detected by IHC. Also, EBV was assessed for EBV-latent membrane protein 1 by IHC and was negative (Figures 2–4   ). Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were performed and showed hypercellular with depressed erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis and megakaryocytic hyperplasia. The striking finding in bone marrow was infiltration by abnormal medium to large cells with rounded nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant basophilic cytoplasmic resembling immunoblast with plasmacytic differentiation. Flow cytometry analysis showed these abnormal cells were positive for CD45 (weak), CD10, CD38, CD138, and lambda light chain restriction, and negative for CD34, human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related, CD19, CD20, CD56, CD117, Sig, and CD58, and T-cell and myeloid markers were also negative. Unfortunately, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated and he died 1 week after diagnosis. "

Physical examination revealed a lump located on left wrist. The size of the lump clinically was 5cm by 6cm with shiny skin, clear border, firm in consistency, and fixed to the bone (Fig. 1 a). Her wrist extension and flexion was limited to 10° of flexion and 5° of extension due to pain and mass. On the right and left knees, we found non-tender multiple lumps (Fig. 1b). The x ray of left wrist revealed osteolytic lesion with some geographic patterns (Fig. 1c). She had wide surgical excision of the tumor which extended to the wrist joint and 3cm upper the tumor followed by reconstruction using non vascularized fibular graft. Proximal fibular graft has harvested, including the head of left fibula. We found multiple bony masses with clinical characteristics of multiple exostosis on the proximal site of fibular graft (Fig. 2 a). The excised part of the radius has replaced with non-vascularized fibular graft, then fixed with plate and screws. The distal part of the graft was transfixed with Kirschner wire (Fig. 2d). Histopathology and immunochemistry examination of EXT-1 and BCL-2 revealed some important findings. Histopathological finding revealed GCT with an eosinophilic cytoplasm, round ovals nucleus, vesicular chromatin with small nucleus prominent, and a slight mitosis (Fig. 3 ). Immunochemistry finding revealed existence of EXT-1 but no existence of BCL-2 (Fig. 4 ). Mayo Wrist score was used to evaluate her functional outcome two years post operation. The result is good with total score 90. The patient feels no pain, already returned to regular activities, range of motion return to 75–99% and the grip strength is 100% (Fig. 2e). "
26,S2210-2612(18)30072-5,Obstructive jaundice as primary presentation of a stage IIE Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: A decision making process between advanced lymphoma and locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma," 2 Presentation of case An otherwise-healthy, obese class I (BMI 31.5?kg/m2, BSA 2.0?m2), non-smoking, 76 year-old housewife patient referred to our surgical department owing to progressive jaundice associated with darkening of the urine and pruritus over the preceding 40?days. Direct questioning revealed a history of vague abdominal pain, abdominal distention, fatigue and weight loss of approximately 12?kg over the last 2 months. There was no other previous medical, surgical and relevant family history. At initial presentation jaundice, palpable spleen and palpable firm and fixed bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were present on physical examination. Laboratory studies revealed a significant increase in serum total bilirubin (27.10?mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (294?U/l), ?-glutamyl transferase (113?U/l) and LDH (856?U/l). Regarding tumor markers, level of CA 19-9 (147?U/ml) was elevated. Serum amylase (55 ?U/l), IgG (929?mg/dl), IgG4 (48?mg/dl) and ?2-microglobulin (1.82?mcg/ml) were normal. Initial abdominal CT demonstrated an ill defined pancreatic head mass along with mesenteric and paraaortic lymph nodes enlargement. Dynamic-enhanced pancreatic CT examination with a 16-multidetector row scanner according to a dual-phase pancreatic protocol revealed a bulky, nodular type, solitary, homogenous, hypoattenuating 4?×?5?cm pancreatic head mass with pancreatic and common bile duct dilatation and pancreatic body and tail atrophy. No evidence of local structures tumor invasion was present. Gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRI examination with arterial, venous and delayed phase fat-saturated T1-weighted images demonstrated a bulky circumscribed poorly enhanced mass in the pancreatic head with normally enhanced adjacent pancreatic parenchyma (Fig. 1 a and b). Diagnostic ERCP depicted an irregular interruption of the pancreatic duct and narrowing in the distal common bile duct with upstream dilation. A plastic stent was placed across the biliary obstruction. Excisional biopsy of an enlarged left superficial inguinal lymph node revealed a diffuse growth pattern and large lymphocytes without follicular structures (Fig. 2 ). Immunohistologic findings showed lymphocytes that were strongly positive for CD20, CD79a and Bcl-2 and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD23, CD30, and Bcl-6. These results supported the diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. EUS-FNB with 22G needle of the pancreatic head mass performed in order to allow us to complete the pathologic diagnosis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue specimens showed that tumor cells were medium sized atypical lymphocytes with diffuse proliferation and without follicular structures (Fig. 3 ). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy samples demonstrated no infiltration by lymphoma cells. All the above clinical, imaging and pathologic results were strongly suggestive with the diagnosis of a stage IIE Non-Hodgkin lymphoma with secondary pancreatic head involvement. The patient submitted to the above diagnostic interventions during a two weeks hospital stay and referred to a tertiary hospital for hematology and oncology specialty care. The patient treated with 8 cycles repeated every 21?days of the Cyclophosphamide (750?mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1)-Vincristine (1.4?mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1)-Prednisolone (100?mg by oral administration days 1–5) regimen. Interval abdominal CT for response assessment after 2 and 8 cycles demonstrated partial and complete response of the targeted pancreatic head lesion and mesenteric and paraaortic lymph nodes according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Jaundice and inguinal lymphadenopathy progressively resolved within 3 months from initiation of therapy. The patient experienced mild nausea, soreness, scattered skin rash with mild itching within 24–48?h after treatment without other short and long term side effects. Follow up at the first year including biannual abdominal CT showed no evidence of lymphoma remission. "
28,S2451-9936(16)30202-X,Cystic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of lacrimal gland associated with vision loss: A case report," 2 Discussion We presented an atypical case of cystic MALT lymphoma of lacrimal gland associated with vision loss. Lacrimal gland lymphoma is usually identified as diffuse enlargement and axial elongation of the gland, which follows the contour of the globe, 5  and without producing bone erosion or destruction. 4  In this case, lymphoma was not considered pre-operatively because of its cystic appearance, aggressive course and bone involvement, although it followed the globe contour. Cystic appearance on CT scan rather raises the differential diagnosis of schwannoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. 6  Adenoid cystic carcinoma especially shows aggressive course and bone involvement. 7   MALT lymphoma rarely appears as cyst in the orbit. A cyst is defined as a closed sac with a distinct membrane compared to the nearby tissue. Whereas, this tumor arises from non-encapsulated clusters of lymphocytes in mucosal tissues and does not form a membrane. The mechanism of cyst-like formation in this case was predominantly due to lacrimal duct obstruction by the tumor, which impeded the outflow and caused accumulation of fluids containing lymphoma cells leading to the atypically rapid enlargement of the tumor. It is rare for a MALT lymphoma to present with vision loss. In this case, vision loss is mostly attributed to tumor compression of the optic nerve. Furthermore, exposure keratopathy that developed to corneal ulcer and subsequent endophthalmitis also contributed to visual impairment. Infiltration of the tumor to the globe, which was reported previously and caused vision loss, 8  was, however, not evident in this case. As radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are effective for MALT lymphoma, a simple incisional biopsy is usually performed. However in this case, the tumor was totally removed. If the lymphoma is limited to ocular adnexa, the mode of therapy, either surgical excision, radiation, chemotherapy, or combination, achieves satisfactory results and without prognostic significance. 9,10  However, elderly patients, particularly with dementia, are not cooperative during irradiation and chemotherapy, and they cannot tolerate toxic effects of chemotherapy on occasion. In this case, tumor excision possibly benefited the elderly patient with dementia, from avoiding additional therapy. Yet, long term follow-up is mandatory. Evisceration is the preferred surgical treatment for endophthalmitis with vision loss to reduce the risk of spreading the infection along the ophthalmic vein and provide better cosmesis. 11,12  However in this case, enucleation was performed. Enucleation has the advantage of examining the entire globe for possible tumor extension. As well as, removal of the intraocular tumor is ensured if present. "

32,S1092-9134(16)30329-X,Primary cutaneous spindle cell B cell lymphoma: A report of three cases and review of the literature," 2 Results (Tables 1–2)  2.1 Case 1   The patient was a 69-year-old male who presented to his dermatologist for his annual skin check in May of 2011. Clinical examination revealed a nodular elevation of his skin overlying his pacemaker. He recalls that it had been there for some time but had been undergoing some change. It was biopsied and interpreted as an atypical lymphocytic infiltrate. A subsequent referral was made for further diagnostic assessment. The rest of his clinical exam disclosed three additional skin lesions which were biopsy proven seborrheic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and a dysplastic nevus respectively. His past medical history was remarkable for ankylosing spondylitis diagnosed in 1961 complicated by complete heart block, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and invasive melanoma. A significant autoimmune diathesis with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed in his sister and autoimmune liver disease in one other sister, both proving to be fatal, was noted. Following complete excision, he had a staging work up which did not disclose any disease elsewhere. He has had no recurrence of his lymphoma and remains disease free 5years since his initial diagnosis and treatment.  2.1.1 Light microscopic findings The biopsy was remarkable for a dense pandermal nodular and diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate associated with dermal sclerosis. The fibroplasia was distinctive due to its patterned storiform morphology. While there was a background infiltrate of small lymphocytes, there was a significant degree of large cell infiltration. This particular cell populace was in the 15 to 20micron size range; the cells exhibited a vesicular nucleus and ranged from a rounded centroblastic cytomorphology to those manifesting spindled features. A subsequent re-excision specimen demonstrated a striking dominance of small lymphocytes accompanied by the distinctive storiform fibroplasia present on the earlier biopsy. While the infiltrate was predominated by small lymphocytes there was a smattering of larger atypical lymphocytes morphologically similar to those noted in the earlier biopsy including a significant degree of infiltration by atypical cells with a spindled appearance.   2.1.2 Phenotypic studies On the initial biopsy, there was a dominance of CD20 positive B cells over CD3 positive T cells. The B cells stained positively for BCL6 and CD10 with minimal staining for MUM1. The proliferation index was in excess of 75% of the infiltrate. While the earlier biopsy showed a predominance of B cells over T cells, in the re-excision specimen there was a T to B-cell ratio in the realm of 3 to 1. On the CD20 preparation several of the positive staining cells exhibited a spindled appearance and were highlighted by BCL2, BCL6 and CD10. The CD21preparation was essentially negative. The infiltrate was not highlighted by CD23 and was predominantly MUM1 negative.    2.2 Case 2 The patient was a 66-Year-old female with a past medical history remarkable for cutaneous B cell lymphoma involving the skin of her neck first diagnosed in 1996 successfully treated with 30 doses of radiation. In 2013 she developed a recurrence around her radiation site on her neck. She presented in August of 2015 with a new nodule measuring less than 2cm on her cheek. The tumor from the cheek area was excised and the patient has since been asymptomatic without any evidence of recurrent disease at the site of excision nor has there been any development of disease elsewhere. The original slides and report from her 1996 are not available (Fig. 1 ).  2.2.1 Light microscopic findings The excision specimen in 2015 showed a very atypical dermal-based lymphocytic infiltrate with extension into the subcutaneous fat. There was a background infiltrate of benign small lymphocytes. However, there were coalescing nodules of atypical germinal center-like cells, specifically centrocytes and centroblasts. A grenz zone separated this infiltrate from the overlying epidermis. While many of the cells had a classic centrocytic and centroblastic appearance, cells exhibiting a more spindled appearance were also present. The spindled cells shared with the centrocytes and centroblasts, a similar vesicular chromatin. The spindled cell populace was more conspicuous at the periphery of the coalescing nodules and as well they assumed a single cell pattern of growth along collagen and elastic fibers of the reticular dermis.   2.2.2 Phenotypic profile There was a background of reactive CD3 positive and CD5 positive T-cells. The atypical germinal center-like foci were extensively positive for CD20, BCL6 and CD10. These neoplastic centrocytes and centroblasts, however, showed focal staining for BCL2 albeit many of the neoplastic cells were BCL2 negative. A curious finding was the extensive diffuse immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells for CD30.    2.3 Case 3 The patient was a 76-year-old male who presented in July of 2016 with a 1.4cm×1.2cm nodule on the right lateral vertex of his scalp. He was otherwise asymptomatic. The rest of his clinical exam was unremarkable. He underwent complete excision of the lesion. There was no evidence of lymphoma elsewhere. His past medical history was remarkable for coronary artery disease for which he was taking a statin, aspirin, lisinopril, and carvedilol. He is currently symptom free and without evidence of recurrent and or disease elsewhere (Fig. 2 ).  2.3.1 Light microscopic findings The biopsy demonstrated an extensive infiltrate that assumed a fascicular as well as nodular growth pattern within the dermis, lying in close apposition to the epidermis although not permeative of the epidermis. Within the nodular areas of growth, the cells exhibited a more rounded appearance however the prevalent architecture was a fascicular whereby in such foci the dominant cell populace was one exhibiting a spindled appearance. The nuclear characteristics of both the elongate and rounded appearing cells were in the context of a finely dispersed chromatin with conspicuous lightly eosinophilic to basophilic nucleoli. Due to a lack of greater nucleolar prominence, the cells were not typical for an immunoblast. The spindled cells were in the 15 micron size range, demonstrating nuclear contours that that ranged from being twisted serpentine-like to angular. They shared in common with a centroblast, margination of nucleoli to lie in close apposition to the nuclear membranes. Mitotic figures were not infrequent and as well there was significant apoptosis. A dearth of other inflammatory cell elements was noted.   2.3.2 Phenotypic studies A minimal T cell infiltrate was highlighted by CD3 and CD5. The tumor cell populace both in regards to the rounded and the dominant spindled cells were extensively immunoreactive for CD79a and CD20. The neoplastic cells independent of cell shape (i.e. rounded versus spindled) expressed bcl-6 and CD10 although showed only weak immunoreactivity for BCL-2. While the proliferation index was in excess of 90%, the neoplastic cells did not stain positively for CD30. The CD21 preparation demonstrated a very striking dendritic cell network throughout the tumor even though there was no residuum of discrete germinal centers. There were no S100 and CD1a positive Langerhans cells present amidst the neoplastic cells.    2.4 Literature review of previously reported cases (Table 1–2) Forty two cases have been reported in the literature including 14 female and 28 male with a male to female ratio of 2:1 [2-14]. The first reported series from 2000 described 5 of these cases with the majority of the subsequent cases being anecdotal case reports. The largest series to date was published recently and describes 24 cases [13]. The youngest age of presentation reported is 27years while the oldest reported patient is 89 with a mean and median age of 55 and 59years respectively. The lesions were most commonly found on the upper back and head and neck area. The site distribution is as follows: trunk: 16 with involvement of the upper back in 13 and chest in 2, scalp: 13, face: 6 and extremities: 4. All patients except 7 presented with a solitary lesion. In the 2 patients with multiple sites of involvement one patient reported back and shoulder lesions, one patient exhibited chest, arm and back involvement and 5 patients presented with multiple coalescing nodules and plaques on the lower extremity or back. The size of lesions ranged from 0.5–25 cm with a mean diameter of 7 cm. The duration of the lesions were anywhere from a few months to a few years. Eight patients received radiotherapy, one patient had excision followed by radiotherapy, 1 patient underwent excision only and 3 patients received chemotherapy. There was no recurrence in 13 patients with available follow up, and 2 patients died whereby 1 patient who succumbed refused treatment and the second patient died of unclear reason but not specifically one attributable to lymphoma. One 61-year-old male patient developed metastatic disease to the biliary tract 2.5years after his cutaneous B cell lymphoma initial presentation on the back. After treatment of his back lymphoma and the hepatobiliary metastases, the patient is alive, without recurrent and or further metastatic disease. In the most recent series describing 24 cases, they demonstrated a similar site predilection, median age of presentation and male predominance [13] with a male to female ratio was 3:1 and mean age of 55years with two thirds of the cases involving the head/neck area and upper back. The histologic assessment of the 42 reported cases revealed similar findings being in the context of diffuse or nodular infiltrates involving the entire dermis, consisting of atypical lymphocytes comprising centrocytes and centroblasts oftentimes exhibiting a nodular growth pattern reminiscent of a germinal center and atypical spindled cells oftentimes at the periphery of the foci of nodular growth. Spindle-shaped cells had elongated, twisted nuclei and manifested a dispersed chromatin. In most cases the percent of spindled cells ranged from 15 to 80% with an average of 50%. The phenotypic profile suggested a follicle center cell origin revealed by positivity of the tumor cells for BCL6 (all cases in which the stain was performed) and CD10 (10 cases). BCL2 was positive in 40% of cases. CD21 was positive in 10 cases highlighting the residuum of a follicular dendritic cell network while CD30 expression was reported in 6 cases.  "
34,S2255-534X(18)30110-5,Primary lymphoma of the appendix: A case report and review of the literature,"The majority of articles found in the international literature correspond to case reports. In the case series by Marcelo Zamorano et al., from a total of 7626 appendectomy specimens, there were only 25 appendiceal tumors and just 2 of them were primary lymphomas. 5  In another case series that included 5307 appendectomy specimens, Daniel Esmer et al. found a total of 31 cases (0.58%) of appendiceal tumor, none of which corresponded to appendiceal lymphoma. 4  A total of 1060 appendectomy specimens were reviewed over a 10-year period at the Kamineni Hospitals in India and only one case of appendiceal lymphoma was found, 1  illustrating the rareness of the pathology."
39,S2468-6441(16)30036-6,Cardiac Lymphoma Presenting as Subacute Progressive Dyspnea: A Case Report and Review of the Literature on the Pathophysiology and Imaging of Intracardiac Tumors," Case Presentation A 64-year-old white man with past medical history notable only for heavy smoking presented to an outpatient pulmonary clinic complaining of progressive dyspnea over 1 month. He was initially diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and started on daily tiotropium and albuterol, as needed. His symptoms continued to worsen, despite compliance with his prescribed regimen, and he soon developed weight gain and bilateral lower extremity edema. A preliminary transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a large cardiac mass, which prompted referral to our institution. Prior to his scheduled appointment at our hospital, the patient's shortness of breath aggravated to the extent that he was compelled to present urgently to the emergency department of our institution. Review of systems was positive for occasional palpitations, orthopnea, and drenching night sweats for the past three nights. Initial vital signs were regular heart rate of 48 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate of 16, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, blood pressure of 122/89 mm Hg, and temperature of 97.2°F. Physical exam was notable for an obese man in mild distress, evident jugular venous pulsations to the mandible, softened heart sounds, and decreased breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Laboratory workup revealed hyponatremia (128 mmol/L), hypochloremia (91 mmol/L), and elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit (17.2 gm/dL and 53%, respectively). A chest x-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette (Figure 1 ). An electrocardiogram documented complete heart block and a junctional escape rhythm at 56 bpm. A bedside TTE disclosed a large intracardiac mass (6.7 × 4.15 cm), which extended from the right atrium (RA) into the right ventricle (RV), causing severe tricuspid valve obstruction, a moderate pericardial effusion, and a preserved ejection fraction (Figure 2 , Videos 1-4). After admission to the cardiac care unit, the patient underwent a TEE, which confirmed the invasion by the mass of the RA and RV chambers and documented infiltration of the atrial septum, with visualization of a smaller mass (3 × 3 cm) in the left atrium (LA). The obstruction of the tricuspid valve orifice, virtually complete, resulted in elevated transvalvular diastolic gradient (11 mm Hg) and contributed, along with the moderate pericardial effusion, to impaired RV filling (Figure 3 , Videos 5-7). Echo-Doppler showed exaggerated respiratory variation in early diastolic inflow velocities through the mitral and tricuspid valves in absence of overt pericardial tamponade physiology. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) ruled out the concurrent presence of additional lesions and confirmed extensive invasion by the cardiac mass of the RA and the RV, with virtual obliteration of the RV inflow tract (Figure 4 , Videos 5-7). Delayed contrast enhancement exposed areas of focal enhancement within the mass, consistent with necrosis. The patient was subsequently evaluated for surgical resection of the cardiac mass and deemed inoperable. Ten days after admission, due to the progressive enlargement of the pericardial effusion causing impending cardiac tamponade, he underwent pericardial window and drain placement with drainage of a total amount of 600 mL of fluid. On gross inspection, a white infiltrate was noted on the heart. The pericardial fluid was sent for flow cytometry evaluation, which disclosed findings consistent with B-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for lymphoma cells, which confirmed the diagnosis of primary cardiac involvement. After consulting with hematology services, he received 3 days of chemotherapy with a rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin regimen. Prior to discharge, which occurred 1 week after, he elected to follow up with his local cardiologist at an outside facility, due to the distant geographical location of his domicile from our institution.

40,S2451-9936(17)30365-1,A case of primary extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma in the orbit and intraocular tissues with cerebrospinal fluid involvement," 2 Case report A 73-year-old woman noted blurred vision and swelling of her right eyelid. She was initially diagnosed with unilateral anterior uveitis and treated with topical steroids (0.1% fluorometron), with no improvement of her symptoms. She was then referred to our clinic 1 month after starting local steroid therapy. Her vision was 20/100 in the right eye and 20/15 in the left eye, and the intraocular pressure was 30 mmHg in the right eye and 14 mmHg in the left. The right conjunctiva showed injection and chemosis. Her right cornea had 50–100 pigmented keratic precipitations and 2 + cells in her right anterior chamber, but there was no evidence of inflammation in her right vitreous, retina, or choroid. There was no evidence of inflammation in her left eye. She had no history of weight loss or night sweats and her body temperature was within the normal range. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a poorly marginated large mass surrounding her right eyeball, with no evidence of extraorbital tumor, suspected to be an inflammatory pseudotumor (Fig. 1 ). A sample of aqueous humor from her right eye was subjected to multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect possible bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or viral infections. 5  PCR analysis was positive for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) DNA (8.5?×?104 copies/ml). She was therefore tentatively diagnosed with EBV-associated anterior uveitis with inflammatory pseudotumor. She was initially treated with 30 mg/day oral prednisolone, which unexpectedly worsened her eyelid swelling. She was then treated with high-dose steroid pulse therapy (1 g methylprednisolone for 3 days) and intravenous acyclovir, which have previously been shown to be effective for EBV-associated ocular inflammation. 6  ,  7  However, her swollen eyelid further worsened after starting steroid pulse therapy (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, she underwent biopsy of the orbital mass 4 days after starting steroid pulse therapy. Pathological examination of the tumor revealed small-to-medium-sized mononuclear cells and irregular cells, strongly suggesting the presence of orbital malignant lymphoma. Orbital radiotherapy was initiated prior to immunohistochemical evaluation, because of the risk of vision loss in her right eye as a result of the elevated intraocular pressure cause by the tumor surrounding her right eye. The tumor responded well to radiotherapy. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD3?, CD2, CD56, CD8, and TIA-1, and negative for CD4, CD7, and CD20. The Ki-67 index was >90%. The tumor cells were also positive for EBV-encoded mRNA by in situ hybridization (Fig. 3 ). These results were consistent with a diagnosis of ENKTL. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated significant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by the right orbit, with no other systemic involvement. The patient was also seen by an otolaryngologist to confirm that there was no nasal involvement. A bone marrow biopsy was negative, but cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed lymphoma cell infiltration although MRI of the brain and spinal cord showed no extraorbital lesions. In accordance with the Ann Arbor staging system, 8  she was then diagnosed with stage IV ENKTL with meningeal involvement. She was treated with three cycles of 2/3DeVIC regimen (dexamethasone, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) plus orbital radiotherapy (total dose of 50 Gy). She also received intrathecal infusions of 15 mg methotrexate and 20 mg prednisolone three times, and three courses of high-dose methotrexate (3.5 mg/m2), as a treatment for CNS lesions. She subsequently achieved complete remission. However, she complained of blurred vision in her left eye 10 months after completing her therapy. Visual acuity was decreased to 10/20 in her left eye. She had 2 + anterior chamber cells with keratic precipitate and 2 + vitreous cells in her left eye. A PET scan showed significant 18F-fluorodexoxyglucose uptake in the left eye (Fig. 4 A). Pars plana vitrectomy was performed to obtain vitreous cells. The presence of malignancy could not be proven pathologically. However, CD3 (?) CD 56 (+) cells, characteristic for ENKTL, were detected in the left eye by flow cytometry, although T lymphocytes are reported to be predominant in normal vitreous. 9  Since significant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was also seen in the left ocular appendix, MRI was performed. However, there was no evidence of extraocular involvement in her left eye (Fig. 4B). In the context of the combined results of a PET scan, flow cytometry from vitreous cells, and MRI, she was diagnosed with relapse of ENKTL in the left eye without extraocular involvement (Fig. 4B). She was treated with the SMILE regimen (dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, l-asparaginase, and etoposide), 10  and intravitreal methotrexate injection in her left eye. After treatment, her left visual acuity recovered to 20/20, and anterior and vitreous cells resolved without any structural damage in the retina or choroid. The patient remained alive 14 months after her diagnosis. "
41,S2214-3300(16)30006-2,An anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer microlesion: A case report," 2 Case report The patient was a 51-year-old asymptomatic woman without a history of smoking. Computed tomography (CT) performed during a lung cancer screening program revealed a 7×5-mm subpleural nodule with an irregular border in the right lower lobe (Fig. 1 ). The background lung parenchyma was almost normal. Levels of serum tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, sialyl SSEA-1 antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment, and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, were within the normal limits. The results of other laboratory studies were almost normal. The patient was diagnosed with early-phase lung cancer. CT-guided tumor marking was performed. Subsequently, video-assisted thoracic wedge resection of the tumor was performed. Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen revealed localized indentation of the visceral pleura (Fig. 2a). On the cut surface of the specimen, a tan-white tumor (diameter, 5×4mm) was adjacent to the pleura, and the visceral pleura retracted towards the lesion (Fig. 2b). The surgical margin was macroscopically negative. Microscopically, the tumor showed a nodular growth pattern without capsulation at a low magnification (Fig. 3a). The center of the tumor showed densely intra-alveolar growth (Fig. 3b). Peripherally, the tumor had lepidic growth along the alveolar wall (Fig. 3c). Elastic fibers of the alveolar wall were diminished in the center of the tumor, but were observed at the periphery with Victoria blue-hematoxylin and eosin staining. Transition from an alveolar-preserved area to an alveolar-destructive area was also evident (Fig. 3d). Immunostaining for CD34 (Fig. 3e) and D2-40 (Fig. 3f) showed the same results. At the center of the alveolar-destructive area, the tumor cells had high nuclear atypia (Fig. 3g). The tumor cells were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (Fig. 4a), ALK (Fig. 4b), E-cadherin, cytokeratin (CK) 7, epithelial membrane antigen, napsin A, ?-catenin, MSH2, MLH1, and MUC1. The cells were also sporadically positive for p53. The Ki-67 mitotic index was 8% (Fig. 4c). The tumor cells were negative for CK20, p63, p40, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6. Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization of the tumor revealed an ALK gene split (Fig. 4d). Based on these results, we diagnosed the tumor as a microlesion of ALK-positive lung cancer. The postoperative course was uneventful without any adjuvant therapy. One year after surgery, the patient was doing well without any signs of recurrence. "

Physical exploration revealed uncorrected far visual acuity of 20/25 in both eyes. RE biomicroscopy presented conjunctiva with blood vessel tortuosity and hyperemia (++), with a 2×2mm erythematose area at the level of the caruncle (Fig. 1 ) in addition to a 0.7mm diameter salmon-colored tumor at the inferior sac fundus in the bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva, with uneven edges, highly vascularized but without compromising the lacrimal punctus (Fig. 2 ). No alterations were observed in the posterior pole. RE inferior sac fundus incisional biopsy was performed, that confirmed the evidence of lymphoid tissue with atypical pleomorphic lymphocytes with atypical mitosis (Fig. 3 ). In addition, the patient exhibited monoclonality for lambda chains and characteristic lymphoepithelial lesion (Fig. 4 ). The anatomopathological study confirmed the diagnostic of non-Hodgkin type B conjunctival tumor, MALT type low-grade lymphoma. In addition, the immunohistochemical analysis was positive for LCA, CD20 and CD3, positive for reactive cells in the marginal area in BCL-2 and positive for germinal cells in KI 67. The patient was referred to Oncology for assessment, where she was treated with chemotherapy, initially with 375mg/m2 rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) at standard doses every 28 days. Positive response was observed as from the first treatment cycle, with diminished RE conjunctival lesion. After the 4th cycle, the patient exhibited complete conjunctival remission. Nuclear magnetic resonance and computerized action tomography of orbits, brain and abdomen were carried out without findings. Six chemotherapy cycles were administered without adverse effects or alterations at the ocular level. Simultaneously, regular checkups were performed by Ophthalmology at 4-month intervals with normal evaluations. At month 18 after treatment the patient referred diminished visual acuity in RE although she decided not to visit the practice. At month 24 after finishing the treatment the patient suffered ganglion and lung compromise with deterioration of general condition, relapse and increased of the salmon-colored lesion in the upper and lower sac fundus in the bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva (Fig. 5 ). Topical treatment was initiated with cyclosporine A twice a day, autologous serum 4 times a day and 100mg minocycline twice a day.

In the follow-ups, the stomach-ache continued and increased, and therefore, the patient was sent to us on his 3rd day of hospitalization. The patient was taken to Emergency Service. In his medical history, it was observed that the patient was diagnosed with NHL diagnosis 6 months ago, and received R-COP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) treatment whose 4th Session was completed 2 weeks ago. Aside from these, there were no additional background data in his family and resume. In physical examination, there was widespread sensitivity and defense in the stomach. The WBC was 7000×103/?L, and small intestine-type air-liquid leveling was observed in standing direct abdominal graphics. In the CT on the abdomen, it was observed that there was widespread liquid and air in the stomach. For this reason, the patient was urgently taken to operation by general surgery specialist. In the exploration, it was observed that there was widespread intestinal content in the abdomen. There were partly mass lesions in all small intestine segments. It was determined that one of the lesions was perforated in a distance of 75cm to ileocecal valve (Fig. 1 ). Small intestine resection to include these two lesions was applied. The patient was observed as stable in terms of clinical and laboratory values in the postoperative period, and was discharged with recommendations on the postoperative 5th day.

45,S0344-0338(16)30208-4,Composite lymphoma with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma components: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Morphologic evaluation The right colon and terminal ileum surgical specimen (including mesenteric lymph nodes) was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Paraffin sections were stained with H&E for routine histologic examination.  2.1.1 Immunohistochemical staining Immunohistochemical staining was performed on an automated BenchMark ULTRA immunostainer (Ventana, Tucson, AZ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections were sequentially cut (4mm thick sections), mounted, dewaxed, and immunostained. The following primary antibodies were used: CD3 (clone 2GV6), CD5 (clone 4C7), CD10 (clone SP67), CD15 (clone MMA), CD20 (clone L26), CD30 (clone Ber-H2), PAX5 (clone SP34), CD45 (clone LCA—RP2/18), Ki67 (clone (30-9), BCL-2 (clone 124), BCL-6 (clone GI191E/A8), and MUM-1 (clone MUM1p). Antibody detection was performed using the iVIEW DAB Detection Kit (Ventana, Tucson, AZ, United States) with 3,3?-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Appropriate positive and negative tissue control samples were used with each run. In-situ hybridization analysis to determine the presence of EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections with EBER 1 DNP probe as part of the Ventana ISH kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.   2.1.2 Immunoglobulin heavy chain analysis Tumoral cells from the DLBCL-NOS and CHL components were macrodissected from uncovered 4?m-thick unstained slides containing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Isolation of genomic DNA from the two lymphomas was performed separately in parallel and followed by two separate immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangement studies by fragment length analysis. The latter included multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with five sets of BIOMED consensus primers of the heavy chain variable (frameworks 1, 2 and 3) to joining regions and of diversity and joining (DH1-6-JH, DH7-JH) sites, done according to the manufacturer’s protocol (InVivoScribe Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA) and as previously reported [3]. Following five PCR reactions, fragment size analysis was completed in four capillary electrophoretic injections using an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, with subsequent analysis done using the Applied Biosystems GeneMapper v4.0 software. External polyclonal and monoclonal controls were used.   2.1.3 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetic studies Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetic studies were performed in the interphase cells from a representative paraffin-embedded tissue section from the mass in the right colon and terminal ileum specimen. The following probes were used: a locus specific identifier (LSI) IGH/BCL2 t(14;18) dual fusion translocation probe, a LSI BCL6 (3q27) major and alternate breakpoint dual color breakapart probe and a LSI MYC (8q24) dual color breakapart probe (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA). Analysis was performed on an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with appropriate filters, and images were captured with CytoVision image capture software (Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A minimum of 100 interphase nuclei were scored.   2.1.4 Search for previously reported cases An inquiry for cases of CL with DLBCL-NOS and CHL components was conducted in PubMed using the terms “composite”, “lymphoma”, “Hodgkin” and “diffuse”. A subsequent review of the references listed in the publications that matched the initial search criteria was also performed. A systematic search for gender, age, diagnosis, anatomic location, medical history, results of immunohistochemical, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), molecular and cytogenetic studies, treatment and outcome was conducted using the published literature. A de novo presentation was assumed in the reported cases in which a prior history of lymphoma was not specifically described. Cases without simultaneous involvement of an organ or anatomic site by DLBCL-NOS and CHL were excluded from the study.   "
46,S2210-2612(17)30550-3,Malignant lymphoma incidentally diagnosed due to the perforation of the small intestine caused by a fish bone: A case report," 2 Case presentation A 90-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. She had a medical history of hypertension and pneumonia. A physical examination showed tenderness at the lower abdomen. However, neither muscular defense nor Blumberg’s sign were clearly shown. Her body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and SpO2 were, 38°C, 104/54mmHg, 98/min, 21/min and 99% (3L of oxygen), respectively. Laboratory studies on admission showed elevated levels of inflammation (white blood cells: 16,100/?l, CRP: 10.13mg/dl) and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 1.48mg/dl, BUN: 27.7mg/dl). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated free air and ascites in the abdominal cavity (Fig. 1 A, B). In the pelvic cavity, a radiopaque linear shadow about 35mm in diameter was shown in the small intestine, and that stricture was exposed to the abdominal cavity (Fig. 1C, D). Therefore, a diagnosis of perforation of the small intestine due to ingestion of a foreign body and panperitonitis was made. Emergent laparotomy was performed. The intraoperative findings revealed perforation of the small intestine with a fish bone in the jejunum, at a site some 70cm distal from the Treitz ligament. Local inflammation of the small intestine at the perforation site was seen, and circulated wall thickness was observed at the distal side of the jejunum. Therefore, both partial resection of the jejunum and anastomosis of jejuno-jejunostomy were performed. No other abnormalities were seen in the peritoneal cavity, including the rest of the intestine and lymph nodes. The resected specimen showed perforation of the small intestine due to a fish bone 35mm in length (Fig. 2 A, B). The anal side of the perforation site showed circulated thickness of the wall (Fig. 2C). A pathological examination revealed diffuse spreading of medium-sized lymphocytes in the mucosa and submucosa, and a follicular structure was seen (Fig. 3 A, B). An immunohistochemical study showed CD20, CD79a, CD10 and bcl-2 positivity (Fig. 3C, D, E). The specimen was negative for CD3. Therefore, malignant lymphoma of follicular lymphoma Grade 1 was made. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the ninth postoperative day. No additional imaging examinations nor treatments for the malignant lymphoma were performed, considering patient’s age and background, after receiving her informed consent. "
47,S1015-9584(13)00099-7,Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the common bile duct: A case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 57-year-old man with no previous chronic medical illnesses presented with a 2-week history of severe itching all over his body, associated with general fatigue, malaise, and nausea, without vomiting or anorexia. He also reported having a yellowish discoloration of sclera, dark (tea color) urine, and a bulky foul-smelling stool. However, he denied any history of fever or chills, abdominal pain, previous episodes of similar symptoms, recent travels, or contact with sick people. He is not on any regular medications, and he denied recent ingestion of any drug. His surgical history and family history showed no significant finding. Moreover, he has a 40 pack-year smoking history but no history of alcohol consumption or illicit drug use. On presentation his vital signs were within normal limits. The physical examination revealed deep scleral and skin jaundice with itching marks on his skin. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy and no stigmata of chronic liver disease. An abdominal examination revealed a soft and lax abdomen with mild tenderness over the epigastric and right upper quadrant areas, and active bowel sounds but no masses or hepatosplenomegaly. His laboratory results showed hemoglobin, white cell count, and platelets of 15 g/dL, 7 × 103/mm3, and 162 × 103, respectively. His serum total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and amylase results were 18.3 mg/dL 16.1 mg/dL, 116 U/L, 66 U/L, 161 U/L, 658 U/L, 898 U/L, and 58 U/L, respectively. His blood carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level rose to more than 1200 U/mL, and carcinoembryonic antigen was within normal levels at 0.88 ng/mL. Hepatitis A, B, and C serology was negative. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed dilated common hepatic and intrahepatic ducts. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was subsequently performed and showed a 3-cm mid-common bile duct stricture with significantly dilated intrahepatic and common hepatic biliary ducts. The rushing cytology of the common bile duct was suspicious for malignancy. A 9-cm, 10 F stent was inserted across this for drainage (Fig. 1 A). The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mild intrahepatic biliary tree dilatation but was otherwise unremarkable (Fig. 1B). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed a marked tapered stricture at the distal common bile duct with mild to moderate dilatation of biliary tree proximally, and a normal pancreatic duct (Fig. 1C). Based on the above presentation and investigations, a presumptive diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma was made, and extrahepatic biliary tract excision, a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and porta-hepatis lymph nodes excision were performed. A histopathologic examination of the common bile duct revealed a large B cell-type NHL with tumor-free surgical resection margins (Fig. 2 ), and the porta-hepatis lymph nodes showed a reactive nonspecific hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD3, CD5, CD20, CD45, BCL2, and Ki67, and negative for CD15 and CD30 (Fig. 3 ). The patient was referred to the oncology clinic, where a positron emission tomography showed no evidence of malignant lesions. He received six cycles of chemotherapy using the CVP-R (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab) protocol. One-year follow-up chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT and whole-body positron emission tomography scans revealed no evidence of malignancy. He received six maintenance courses of rituximab (anti-CD20) and remains in complete remission 5 years from the time of diagnosis with a normal whole-body CT scan. "
48,S2210-2612(16)30550-8,Methotrexate-associated primary hepatic malignant lymphoma following hepatectomy: A case report," 2 Presentation of case A 65-year-old woman was admitted for the treatment of her liver tumor in April 2015. Her height and weight were 146cm and 48kg, respectively. She is a hepatitis B virus carrier and has a history of RA. MTX was introduced seven years prior for RA treatment. Her laboratory data showed no elevation of several tumor markers. Both her physical examination and liver function test results were normal. On abdominal echo, a low echoic tumor was detected at segment 6 (S6), with a size of 16×29mm. On contrasted CT, the tumor was slightly enhanced at the early phase, and tumor staining was sustained at the delayed phase (Fig. 1 a–d). MRI showed that the tumor was weakly enhanced at the early phase, and revealed hypo intense areas at both late and hepatobiliary phases (Fig. 2 a–d). The differential diagnoses include well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic liver tumor, and PHL. Subsegmentectomy of the S6 was performed with an operative time of 252min and intraoperative bleeding amount of 240mL. The specimen shows that the tumor was a whitish solid with an irregular margin (Fig. 3 ). The final pathological diagnosis was MTX-associated PHL. On immunohistochemical analysis, CD20, CD30, and CD79a were positive, but CD10 and CD15 were negative (Fig. 4 ). EBER (EBV-encoded small RNA) was also positive. These findings were consistent with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) according to the WHO 2008 classification of lymphoid tissue. However, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT and bone marrow aspiration sample did not indicate any sign of ML. The patient was discharged in our department without any complication, and was transferred to the hematology department of Kawasaki University. Additionally, bone marrow aspiration was performed, but residual tumor cells were not detected. She survived with no recurrence for one year even without any additional chemotherapy. MTX withdrawal was effective for the recurrence of ML afterwards. "

Over the next 8 months, slow enlargement of minimally tender nodular induration at the site prompted biopsy of an approximately 1- to 2-cm tumor. Histopathology found dense sheets of large lymphoid cells staining positively for CD20, PAX-5, CD-79, Bcl-2, and MUM1, consistent with DLBCL, with features compatible with primary DLBCL, leg type (Fig 1 ). 4  No constitutional symptoms or lymphadenopathy were reported. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan and bone marrow biopsy found no evidence of systemic involvement, yielding Ann Arbor stage IE. She underwent definitive localized radiation therapy (total dose of 36 Gy in 18 fractions followed by an electron boost to the vulva of 6 Gy) with remission of her disease, with continued remission 7 years later.   Case 2 A 73-year-old woman of European descent, gravida 2 para 2, presented with a 2-month history of a mass involving the clitoris and right anterior aspect of the labium minus, measuring 4 × 2 × 1.5 cm. Initial biopsy found a dense lymphoid infiltrate composed of CD20+ lymphocytes featuring medium- to large-sized centroblastlike cells, co-expressing Bcl-2, CD23, and weak CD10, but not Bcl-6, CD3, CD5, or cyclin D1. Wide excision of the lesion 3 weeks later found large cells in a vaguely nodular pattern (Fig 2 ) staining positively for CD20, CD10, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, and MIB-1 (60%) but negatively for MUM1 and Epstein-Barr encoding region, interpreted as DLBCL, germinal center B-cell (GCB) type. Bone marrow biopsy and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan found no further evidence of malignancy, yielding Ann Arbor Stage IE. No further therapy was administered. No systemic disease has been seen by computed tomography imaging during surveillance up to 65 months from diagnosis.  "
51,S2049-0801(16)30259-X,Primary thyroid lymphoma: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 59-year-old woman was referred to the endocrine surgical unit due to compressive cervical symptoms. Her medical history included hypertension. There was no known history of cervical irradiation or family history of thyroid cancer. The patient mentioned that her child was diagnosed with a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT) of the parotid gland 3 months prior to our observation. She presented with a gradual onset of anterior cervical pain and dysphagia with 3 months of evolution and emergence of dysphonia 15 days before consultation. Laboratory tests showed normal thyroid function, with no significant deviations. The cervical ultrasound (Fig. 1 ) revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with heterogeneous echo structure, revealing a nodular lesion occupying almost the entire left lobe, migrating to the mediastinum, correlated with a substernal goiter. No enlarged lymph nodes were noticed. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid gland was performed twice, proving both times to be inconclusive. The vocal cords were evaluated by laryngoscopy revealing paralysis of the left vocal cord with good compensation of the right cord and no involvement of the glottic lumen. The patient was submitted to a total thyroidectomy with intraoperative findings of a globally hardened thyroid, showing a multinodular right lobe and an enlarged left lobe, with its inferior region located on the substernal region, strongly adherent to the trachea and esophagus with no evident cleavage plane. It was not possible to identify the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Macroscopically, the resected thyroid gland was enlarged and assymetrical, weighing 43.4 g, while measuring 5.9 × 5.3 × 4.7 cm. The specimen was serially sectioned, revealing extensive multinodular whitish areas with a fleshy and firm cut surface. The histological examination (Fig. 2 ) revealed partial effacement of the thyroid parenchymal architecture by a population of round-to-oval lymphoid cells, with large and pleomorphic nuclei, coarse nuclear chromatin, visible nucleoli and scarse eosinophilic cytoplasm. Infiltration of the follicular epithelium, creating lymphoepithelial lesions, was noticed. The mitotic rate was 30 mitoses/10 HPFs, with atypical mitoses and foci of necrosis. Vascular invasion was seen, as well as infiltration of the surrounding fatty tissue and pre-thyroidal muscles. On the surrounding thyroid parenchyma, extensive chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) coexisted. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens and showed neoplastic cells diffusely immunoreactive to CD 20, with kappa light chains restriction and were negative for bcl-2, CD 10, lambda light chains and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. Proliferation index using Ki67 was 70%. With these morphologic and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in a background of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, was made. She was discharged on the third postoperative day, hemodynamically stable with normal serum calcium and maintaining dysphonia. The postoperative period was complicated with a readmission 10 days after discharge due to symptomatic hypocalcemia interpreted in the context of transitional iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism. The patient was reevaluated by laryngoscopy, maintaining left vocal cord paralysis and was proposed to speech language therapy. Despite the maintenance of dysphonia, the patient reported a significant improvement of the compressive symptoms. The Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan showed supradiaphragmatic lymph node involvement extending from the thyroid cartilage to the left mediastinum. After Oncology Group Consulting, she started R-CHOP chemotherapy (Rituximab - Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone). Two years after de diagnosis the patient is disease-free. "
52,S0303-8467(16)30283-9,Isolated sciatic neuropathy as an initial manifestation of a high grade B-cell lymphoma: A case report and literature review," 2 Case report The patient is a 65year old African-American man who presented to Neurology service in September 2015 for a 9 months history of right foot drop, pain and numbness in his right lower extremity from knee down. He developed severe pain subacutely in his lumbosacral region radiating primarily into the right lower extremity posteriorly with minor involvement in his left posterior leg as well. The severe pain lasted for approximately 1 week and then improved slightly but has been persistent since then. He also developed right foot drop and numbness in his right lower extremity and the weakness has been progressively getting worse to the point that he cannot move his right foot at ankle. He was evaluated outside and had lumbar MRI which was unremarkable except some mild degenerative changes and no surgery was recommended. He denies any other neurological signs or symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, breathing, ptosis, diplopia, and bladder or bowel problems. He has no fever, cough, weight loss or any other systematic symptoms. His past medical history is significant for left suprarenal mass that was biopsied to be indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2011. This has been followed by serial imaging and has been stable without any therapy. His social history is significant for a history of 90 pack cigarette smoking for 45 years. His other histories are unremarkable. His initial neurologic exam was otherwise unremarkable except decreased muscle strengths at right foot dorsiflexion 0/5, inversion 0/5, eversion 0/5, plantarflexion 0/5; decreased sensation to light touch/pinprick in his right foot up to midcalf and absent reflexes in bilateral brachioradialis, biceps, triceps, knees and ankles with equivocal plantar responses bilaterally. After his initial neurology evaluation, nerve conduction studies of his right lower extremity showed absent sural and superficial peroneal sensory responses along with absent tibial and peroneal motor responses with normal right radial sensory response. Needle EMG study showed active denervation in the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius and semitendinosus muscles; no voluntary activity was observed in these muscles except in the semitendinosus muscle, which showed motor units with increased amplitude, duration and reduced recruitment. The vastus medialis, iliopsoas and gluteus medius muscles were normal (Tables 1 and 2  ). The electrodiagnostic study was interpreted as consistent with a chronic, severe right sciatic neuropathy with ongoing denervation. MRI (Figs. 1 and 2  ) with gadolinium of his pelvis and right upper lower extremity showed lobular mass-like thickening with associated inflammation along the right sciatic nerve in the right proximal thigh. PET/CT scan (Fig. 3 ) with FDG injection showed hypermetabolic reaction or avid FDG reactions in the right sciatic nerve; left retroperitoneal lymph node; left internal iliac lymph node; right mesenteric lymph node; left erector spinal muscle and left gluteus medius muscle which are all suspicious for sites of lymphoma. Needle biopsy of the right sciatic nerve showed diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (Fig. 4 ). Given the stage, the patient was treated with steroid and R-CHOP for chemotherapy and he has been followed by his local hematologist. "
53,S2444-0507(16)30105-X,Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast. A case report," Clinical case A 70 year-old woman referred to the Oncology Department of Hospital de Ginecopediatría No. 48 of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, with the diagnosis of cancer of the left breast. She is diabetic and in treatment with oral hypoglycemics; she also has hypertension, for which she takes enalapril. The process commenced 4 months before she visited her doctor, when she detected mammary nodule in her left breast. The initial lesion was located in the superoexternal quadrant of the left mammary gland, and growth was slow, expansive and painless; it was accompanied by local cutaneous changes and malaise, with weight loss, fatigue, chill and sweating. She therefore visited her Family Medicine Unit, where the diagnosis was mastitis and antibiotic treatment was prescribed. As there was no improvement in the mammary lesion or the cutaneous lesions she was referred to the Oncology Department of Hospital de Ginecopediatría No. 48. She presents with asymmetry due to tumour substitution of the left mammary gland, which has increased in volume with a tumour that includes all 4 quadrants, unattached to the pectoral muscle; cutaneous changes due to invasion, orange skin, cutaneous metastasis, retraction of the nipple- areola complex with invasion, areas of ischaemia in the surface of the areola, at expression of the nipple no material at all is expressed. The ipsilateral axilla has a conglomerate 5cm in diameter in level II, mobile. Supraclavicular without cervical adenopathies, the rest of the examination without relevant changes (Fig. 1 ). The mammographic study revealed: diffuse thickening of the skin of the left mammary gland, with a dense pattern that substituted 80% of the mammary tissue and extended in an irregular way to the pre- and retromammary fatty layer; the vascular trajectories are partially calcified. Multiple dense adenopathies are identified in the axillary regions, with loss of the radiolucid centre and invasion of the adjacent soft tissues (Figs. 2 and 3  ). Complementary ultrasound scan confirmed the diffuse thickening of the skin; the glandular tissue showed solid and irregular areas that were vascularised concentrically in lines A and B, which were interconnected by areas of diffuse infiltration. The axilla contained multiple adenopathies of up to 3.3cm, with loss of the fatty hilum. The clinical diagnosis of probable breast cancer was established. Due to the local extension of the lesion it was staged as cT4b vs. cT4d because of the presence of skin metastasis or lymphatic infiltration in the skin of the mammary gland, and cN2 due to an ipsilateral axillary conglomerate, clinical stage IIIB. A biopsy was taken from the mammary gland with a skin core to document skin infiltration. At this moment tumour extension studies were requested; the histopathological report on the biopsy corroborated the infiltration by a diffuse large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with a high histological grade. The immunohistochemical profile of the lesion gave the result of CD20 positive, CD10 positive, BCL-2 positive, Ki-67 positive in 100% of tumour cells, CD5, cyclins and MUM-1 negative. A diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of immunophenoype B was confirmed, with a 100% proliferation index. Computerised thoracic-abdominal-pelvic tomography reported no tumour activity in other organs apart from the mammary lesion and axillary adenopathy. Simple X-ray of the thorax is normal. Lactic dehydrogenase is almost double the normal value, at 1146U, beta-2 microglobulin is normal at 3.34mg; the other laboratory parameters are normal. Bone marrow aspirate shows no infiltration whatsoever. This was staged as stage IIE non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, due to the local involvement of the mammary gland as well as the ipsilateral axillary infiltration. She was given a total of 8 cycles of R-CHOP induction chemotherapy, one cycle every 3 weeks. At the end of this treatment she was given rituximab as single-drug maintenance therapy, with one cycle every 8 weeks during 12 months. At the end of the R-CHOP treatment she was given 50.4Gy radiotherapy with tangential axillary/supraclavicular fields in 25 fractions. After the second treatment cycle the cutaneous changes in the mammary gland reduced, as did the axillary adenopathy: levels of lactic dehydrogenase in serum returned to their normal value. A follow-up mammographic study at 6 months showed changes associated with mammary fibrosis, with no evidence of disease activity. Once treatment had ended the patient remains under surveillance: at 15 months she is alive and free of disease activity. "
54,S1878-8750(16)31087-7,Long-Term Survival of Primary Intracranial Plasmablastic Lymphoma: Case Report and Review of the Literature," Case Report In December 2012, a 32-year-old man visited our hospital complaining of a progressively growing, painful mass on the right parieto-occipital part of head. He experienced trauma of the head 1 month previously, and the computed tomography (CT) scan taken at that time was unremarkable (Figure 1A ). The mass appeared 10 days after the trauma. On physical examination, a 10 × 8-cm firm, subcutaneous mass was found that adhered to the skull. No other neoplasm was found in other regions, including the oral and nasal cavities. The patient was HIV-negative. Twenty-five days after the trauma, another CT scan of head was performed, which revealed a new mass with partial bone destruction (Figure 1B). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the lesion extended from the dura to subcutaneously and had significant homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid injection (Figure 1C). The patient underwent craniotomy to remove the tumor. Total resection and cranioplasty were completed in one stage. The tumor was fairly firm and the soft friable parts admixed with fleshy, vascular tissue. The subcutaneous tissue, galea, skull, and the outer layer of dura were destroyed, whereas the inner layers of dura and cortex were not invaded. The tumor was removed completely with the dura, and clear surgical margins were obtained. Artificial materials were used to repair dura and skull defects (Figure 1D). Findings of a postoperative pathologic examination showed large tumor cells with mostly centrally located nuclei. There were one or more nucleoli in the nuclei. Abnormal mitoses and apoptotic bodies were observed (Figure 2A ). Immunohistochemical staining revealed the tumor was positive for CD38, CD138, MUM-1, CD30, CD68, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin and negative for CD1a, CD3, CD5, CD20, CD79a, PAX-5, BCL-6, MPO, and HMB45 (Figure 2B–G). The Ki67 index exceeded 50% (Figure 2H). The patient was diagnosed with PIPBL. After surgery, the patient's pain disappeared. Twenty days after operation, the patient received chemotherapy. The chemotherapy protocol was hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, pirarubicin, and dexamethasone) regimen and bortezomib with 6 cycles. Intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) was added with 5 cycles. No evidence of recurrence was found on an MRI scan 3 months and CT scan 6 months after surgery (Figure 1E,F). The patient is surviving well more than 3.5 years later at follow-up. "
55,S0899-7071(16)30070-5,Dramatic treatment response of cutaneous plasmablastic lymphoma in an HIV patient: a case report," 2 Discussion Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an AIDS defining illness that is a variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). An increased risk of lymphomas has been seen in HIV infected patients; it is more rapid in progression, and is often associated with poor outcomes. In 60% of cases, there are concurrent EBV infections [4]. Dual infection with EBV and HHV8 has also been seen with PBL [2]. Approximately 70% of AIDS-associated lymphomas are the non-Hodgkin's type [1]. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including DLBCL is increasing within the HIV population [3]. As many as 16% of deaths in AIDS patients have been associated with lymphomas [1]. PBL has been observed in 2.6% of all HIV related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [4]. They occur mostly within the oral cavity. Presentation of cutaneous manifestations begin with solitary or grouped nodules which may be skin-toned or purple in color, but may also present as erythematous plaques or ulcerated nodules. These nodules may begin at the cutaneous level but overtime may involve deeper structures. Imaging characteristics of PBL is much like the appearance of DLBCL with definitive sub characterization through biopsy. Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas are seen on CT as enhancing nodules and infiltrative cutaneous and subcutaneous masses [5]. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they are masses that are hypointense on T1 which enhance after the administration of gadolinium and hyperintense on T2 and FLARE sequences [5]. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is the most useful as it can provide metabolic information as well as anatomic location which aids in looking for distant spread and assessing treatment response. Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas are very fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avid [5]. Imaging findings are fairly non-specific and ultimately, tissue biopsy will definitively differentiate these lesions. However, importance of imaging is emphasized for following recurrence. Histologically they are a monomorphic cellular proliferation of plasmablasts with centrally or eccentrically placed nuclei and high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, eosinophilic cytoplasm, high mitotic index (Ki-67 expression is usually >80%) and absence of neoplastic plasma cells in the background [2]. Though a high-grade B cell lymphoma, it expresses little or no expression of B cell markers, such as CD20, CD79a, and PAX5. Plasma cell markers such as CD38, VS38c, CD138, and multiple myeloma oncogene-1 markers are universally expressed [2,4]. The pathogenesis of PBL is not well understood. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed which involve the complex interaction between HIV immunodeficiency, co-infection with oncogenic viruses, such as EBV and HHV8, and gene rearrangements, which may lead to increased neoplastic B-cell proliferation [2]. PBL is an aggressive neoplasm with reported death within 6 months to 2 years and very few long-term survivors [2,4]. Chemotherapy may be used; however currently there is no standardized regimen. Patients often receive chemotherapy that is utilized for other aggressive lymphomas, such as CHOP or hyper-cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone [2]. Due to the high risk of recurrence and progression during treatment, intrathecal methotrexate or cytarabine is often used [2]. It has been shown that patients receiving HAART and chemotherapy in combination have higher rates of remission [1,2,7]. This may be explained by restoration of immunity, which may aid in tumor surveillance. PBL is generally associated with a poor response to therapy and early dissemination, though there are cases with good response to chemotherapy [2,6,8]. Differential diagnosis includes Kaposi Sarcoma, hyper-vascular lymph node metastatic disease, Castleman disease and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Imaging plays an important role in the surveillance of the disease given the high risk of progression and recurrence of PBL. Our cases demonstrate remarkable treatment response with CHOP and intrathecal methotrexate as shown on follow up CT. The patient would continue to benefit from regular imaging surveillance to plan further treatment if indicated which in turn may prolong survival and decrease morbidity. "

Case report and review of the literature","A 22-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell NHL at the age of 15, treated with chemotherapy, in complete remission. He reported a family history of NHL and melanoma (2 siblings of his paternal grandfather). At age 21, he was diagnosed with a 2.23mm Breslow's depth melanoma in the right cervical region. The sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative, so close monitoring was decided. One year later, a right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was observed in the examination, confirming melanoma metastasis by fine needle aspiration. PET/CT also showed left laterocervical lymphadenopathies, with no other findings. A bilateral cervical lymphadenectomy was performed, which revealed melanoma metastasis in right cervical lymphadenopathies and PTC metastasis in bilateral lymphadenopathies. In the subsequent thyroid ultrasound, a node was observed in the left lobe, so total thyroidectomy was performed, which confirmed the PTC, and treatment was completed with radioactive iodine ablation. The melanoma BRAF study was negative; finally, a high-dose treatment with interferon alfa was decided. The patient was lost to follow-up when changing his place of residence."

CT scan showed a 6.0 cm × 4.0 cm × 2.0 cm upper left chest wall mass (Fig. 1 ). Needle biopsy through the chest wall revealed a adenocarcinoma of lung. No metastasis was discovered. As there were no surgical contraindications, the patient then was admitted to clinical thoraco-surgery to remove the tumor. Immunohistochemical assay revealed both a lung adenocarcinoma and a large B cell-type lymphoma (DLBCL). The tumor was immunoreactive for Vim, CD20, CD79a and CD45 (partly), and nonimmunoreactive for NapsinA, S-100 and ALK (Fig. 2 ). Both lung adenocarcinoma cells and B cell lymphoma cells were surrounded by inflammation cells (Fig. 3 ). She completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin (GP) regimen and 2 cycles with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) regimen.

60,S0022-510X(16)30820-6,Usefulness of senile hemangioma biopsy for diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma: A report of two cases and a literature review,"Senile hemangioma biopsy is useful for diagnosing IVLBCL. In our study, the positive random skin biopsy rate was 17% (1/6 sites), whereas that of senile hemangioma biopsy was 80% (4/5 sites); in other words, senile hemangioma biopsy yielded a higher positive rate, although few cases were analyzed. In Case 1, only the senile hemangioma biopsy specimens contained tumor cells and were therefore very useful for the diagnosis of IVLBCL. Three previous case reports have described simultaneous random skin and senile hemangioma biopsies [1–3]. Among the 5 reported cases, including our 2 cases, the positive random skin biopsy rate was 25% (4/16 sites), compared to a rate of 70% (7/10) for senile hemangioma biopsy sites; again, senile hemangioma biopsy yielded a higher positive rate than random skin biopsy. However, it will be necessary to compare these biopsy types in additional consecutive cases for validation. One issue is that senile hemangioma, a small red hemangioma that is more frequent with age, occurs a few in young people but affects approximately 80% of people aged ?40years [4]; therefore, some suspected patients have no senile hemangioma. Additionally, it is currently necessary to consider that in some cases, tumor cells may be detected by random skin biopsy but not by senile hemangioma biopsy. Therefore, we suggest that patients with suspected disease undergo both types of biopsy, if possible, to increase the diagnosis rate. This would obviously be useful for some additional cases, including our Case 1 and previously reported cases [2,3] in which tumor cells were detected by senile hemangioma biopsy but not by random skin biopsy. Complications of senile hemangioma biopsy, including hemorrhage and infection, are the same as those of random skin biopsy."

Patients’ information was anonymized for analysis.  2.1 Patients Thirteen continuous patients with primary intestinal NK/T cell lymphomas, nasal type were selected in the files of the Department of Pathology, Xinqiao Hospital of the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China, from January 2011 to December 2016. The pathological diagnosis of the tumor was based on the new World Health Organization classification of lymphomas (2016) [17]. All pathological results were reviewed by two pathologists. Specimens included endoscopic biopsy (n?=?6) and surgical specimens (n?=?7). The diagnosis and classification were based on immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER), and genetic features.   2.2 Clinical data collection Clinical data, including patients’ demographic information, clinical symptoms, the presence of B symptoms (B symptoms refer to systemic symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, lesion sites, endoscopic findings, complications, emergency surgery, treatment and last follow-up, were collected from the patients’ records. The Ann Arbor staging system by Musshoff [18] was used for clinical staging. The endoscopic findings of primary gastrointestinal NK/T cell lymphoma were divided into four types as described in Kim’s study [15], including (1) superficial/erosive, (2) ulcerative, (3) ulceroinfiltrative and (4) infiltrative.   2.3 Statistical analysis All analyses were performed using the SPSS Statistics 19.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Non-normal continuous variables were reported as medians (minimum – maximum). Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or the last follow-up visit. Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan and Meier method. Survival curves were plotted for gender, age, the location of lesion, whether they received emergency surgery and whether they received chemotherapy. P values <0.05 were considered significant.  "
63,S1930-0433(18)30069-4,Primary lymphoma of the breast: A case series," 2 Discussion Although lymphomas are one of the most common hematologic malignancies, breast involvement with lymphoma is very rare. This occurs mostly in the   secondary form as part of extra nodal tumor involvement in disseminated disease. PBL is even rarer, accounting for 0.04–0.5% of all breast malignancies [1,2] and 0.85–2.2% of extranodal lymphomas [3–5]. The criteria for the diagnosis of PBLs were defined by Wiseman and Liao in 1972 and include: (a)    both mammary tissue and lymphomatous infiltrate present in close association in an adequate pathologic specimen; (b) no evidence of widespread lymphoma by standard staging techniques or preceding extra mammary lymphoma, except for ipsilateral axillary node involvement, if diagnosed simultaneously with the breast lymphoma [6]. Non-Hodgkin's DLBCL is the most common histology for PBL, followed by follicular and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas [7,8]. Breast involvement with Hodgkin's disease or T-cell tumor is rare. The clinical presentation of breast lymphoma is usually a single or sometimes multiple painless palpable lumps, which may be bilateral. Nipple or skin retraction, or nipple discharge is rarely seen. The usual B symptoms seen with lymphomas like fever, weight loss, and night sweats are very rare with PBL. It may sometimes present as diffuse breast enlargement and edema and may mimic an inflammatory process. It almost always occurs in females, with the fifth and sixth decades being the most common presenting age. Many studies have reported right breast predominance [7,8]. The imaging findings of breast lymphoma are nonspecific and may resemble any other breast malignancy or sometimes may have a more benign appearance. The most common mammographic abnormality is a solitary noncalcified breast mass with circumscribed or indistinct margins [9–11]. Calcifications, architectural distortion, nipple retraction, or spiculations are usually not seen in association with this malignancy. Global asymmetry may also be a mammographic presentation of PBL, seen in one-third of the patients in the study by Sabate et al., and usually associated with high-grade lymphomas [1]. In one of the largest series by Liberman et al. of 32 cases of NHL in 29 women (66% classified as PBL), the most common mammographic finding was a solitary noncalcified mass (69%). Multiple masses were seen in 9% cases, diffuse increased opacity with skin thickening in 9%, and no mammographic abnormality was seen in 13% cases [12]. Multiple masses are more common with secondary breast lymphoma (SBL), compared to primary. On US a hypoechoic solid oval or round mass with circumscribed or indistinct margins is the most common appearance. Hyperechogenicity, mixed echo pattern, or pseudocystic appearance has also been described in the literature. Posterior acoustic enhancement is present in 52–75% of the masses and hypervascularity is seen in 55–64% [9–12]. Surov et al. found no significant differences in the mammographic or US imaging characteristics between PBL and SBL masses. PBL masses were usually larger at presentation and SBL masses were greater in number in their study [11]. There are no large case reviews on the magnetic resonance imaging of breast lymphoma. The few cases reported in the literature described most masses as being T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense with marked inhomogeneous contrast enhancement, with type 2 kinetics being the most common [13,14]. PET–CT is a valuable tool in the staging and follow-up of lymphoma patients. It may show involvement of axillary nodes or other extranodal disease in breast lymphoma. In the series by Yang et al., 92% of breast lymphomas demonstrated avid homogeneous fluorodeoxyglucose uptake at PET–CT with a mean maximum SUV of 10.6. Some other case reports have described ring-like uptake or diffuse avid PET uptake in the affected breast [15,16]. PET is also very useful in evaluating response to treatment. There are no current established guidelines for the treatment of PBL. Treatment may involve combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Radical mastectomy has been described in the older literature as part of the treatment but subsequent studies showed it offers no benefit, and may actually delay the start of chemotherapy. Chemoimmunotherapy with consolidation radiation therapy is now considered the mainstay in the treatment of PBL. CHOP or CHOP-like anthracycline-based chemotherapy combined with rituximab is now considered the standard treatment for most DLBCL breast lymphomas [17,18]. This may be followed with radiation to the ipsilateral breast and regional nodes. In the study by Avilés et al. the 10 year overall survival in patients treated with either radiation or chemotherapy alone was 50% vs 76% in those who received combination of radiation and chemotherapy. PBL is an aggressive tumor with high relapse rates, mainly involving extranodal sites. Studies have shown high central nervous system relapse rates in up to 20% patients resulting in poor overall survival rates, and recommend adding central nervous system prophylaxis to systemic treatment in PBL [19–21]. PBL is a distinct and rare clinicopathologic entity. It does not have distinctive imaging findings, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a mass lacking spiculations, architectural distortion, or microcalcifications. The primary treatment does not involve surgery but a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. "
64,S1201-9712(18)30047-X,A case-report of a pulmonary tuberculosis with lymphadenopathy mimicking a lymphoma," Case report A 22-year-old Somalian male was referred to the Respiratory Diseases Unit of the university hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, in June 2016. He complained of thoracic pain during his stay in an immigrant reception center, without reporting fever, cough, or any clinically significant comorbidities. The physical examination showed enlarged, not movable, and tender latero-cervical lymph nodes, as well as crackles in the right emi-thorax. Chest X-ray showed a right middle lobe atelectasis and increased bronchovascular markings. Blood examinations showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6g/dl (suspected hypochromic and microcytic anemia), a white blood cell count of 3,930 cells/mm3 (55% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes, 2% eosinophils), and a platelet count of 311,000 cells/mm (Davies et al., 2008). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (6.24mg/dl and 113mm/h, respectively); gamma-globulins on electrophoresis were high but without any monoclonal spikes. His renal and liver function tests were within normal range. Total IgE were 4,820IU/ml. Albumin level was below the normal values (4.00g/dl). A chest CT scan (Figure 1 ) with contrast infusion showed a generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly in the following anatomical sites: latero-cervical (sized ?25–50mm), supraclavicular, subclavian, mediastinal, and sub-diaphragmatic. Para-tracheal, para-cardiac, and right hilar lymph nodes were confluent and enlarged (diameter size: ?30–50mm); furthermore, a right middle lobe collapse, a tree-in bud parenchymal infiltrate, and a right shift of trachea and its bifurcation were found. Spleen showed multiple and rounded lesions. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were smear- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only lymphocytes (CD3+ 90%, CD4+ 68% CD8+ 17%, CD4+/CD8+ 4) were found in the BAL cellular count. A trans-bronchial needle aspiration of the right para-tracheal lymph node was performed; however, the histological pattern was not specific (i.e., non-specific chronic inflammation). Ultrasound scans suggested a lymphoproliferative disorder based on the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, liver enlargement, and small, multiple spleen abscesses. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node. A chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells and central necrosis was found in the histopathological examination. Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott, and Ziehl-Nielsen stained slides did not show any abnormal findings. Immunohistochemistry did not detect tumor cellular markers (i.e., AE1/AE3, CD3, CD20). Based on the clinical features, an empirical anti-TB treatment was started (ethambutol 1.2g/day, isoniazid 300mg/day, rifampicin 600mg/day, pyrazinamide 1.5g/day). However, his clinical conditions rapidly worsened (abdominal pain, vomit, fever, dehydration, elevated liver transaminases levels). One week after TB treatment initiation a left pleural effusion occurred (then, classified as TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). A sample of 2,000ml of pleuritic liquid was collected: it was limpid yellowish, with LDH level of 369U/L, total protein of 4.7g/dl, glucose of 60mg/dl, and PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After 47 days, a BAL culture conversion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurred. The drug susceptibility pattern did not show any drug resistances (i.e., isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Patient was discharged from hospital and underwent a new chest CT scan (Figure 1) after 6 months of treatment. It found an improvement of the atelectasis of the right middle lobe, and a decreased size of the subcarinal, right hilar, and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes. "
65,S0185-1063(16)30013-0,Results of radiotherapy in extranodal MALT lymphoma. A case report and literature review," Case report Female patient, 19 years of age, originating from Estado de México, student, negative background for cancer or autoimmune disease susceptible genetic profile, no surgery, chronic-degenerative or trauma history. The patient's symptoms commenced 4 months before the physician's assessment, with the presentation of a tumour in the right lower eyelid of less than 1cm, accompanied by asthenia, adynamia, general deterioration, with no weight loss, euthermic. The patient consulted the ophthalmologist who performed an excisional biopsy, resulting in the histopathological report of marginal zone B lymphoma associated with MALT mucosa. The immunohistochemical panel was positive for CD20, BCL2 and Lambda chain and negative for CD5, CD43 and Kappa chain. The viral panel was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); bone biopsy without infiltration. Initial FDG PET/CT with evidence of level IIA bilateral cervical ganglia, of up to 11mm on its short axis, SUVmax 3.37 of higher metabolic activity on the left side. Ocular structures with no evidence of morphological or metabolic lesions. Consequently, the case was managed in conjunction with the Haematology Department. The patient was initially treated by the haematology department with antibiotic therapy for one month, the exact drug and dose are unknown, with no clinical improvement, consequently cranial tomography was requested, which revealed conjunctival enlargement of the right eye (2.6mm), contralateral eye with conjunctival thickness of 1.7mm within normal parameters. After the treatment described, the patient continued in follow-up for 8 months, during which time FDG PET/CT was again performed showing persisting level IIA bilateral cervical ganglia, with a reduction in the size of the same (less than 10mm) and reduction of the SUVmax 2.9. Given the persistence and progression of the disease, the patient was considered to be a candidate for electron-based external radiotherapy, with a prescribed dose of 36Gy in 20 sessions, conventional fractionation of 1.8Gy and a single direct field of treatment, adjusting this, with a cerrobend block to the electron cone to protect the lens, this being considered an organ at risk. During treatment, the acute toxicity was conjunctivitis, RTOG grade 1 radioepidermitis, no delayed toxicity presented at 18 months of follow-up. Upon completion of treatment a favourable response was obtained with a 100% reduction in the size of the lesion. During the 18 month follow-up, a new imaging study was performed (CT scan), which showed no evidence of the disease. "
66,S0969-8043(16)30390-6,A pioneer experience in Malaysia on In-house Radio-labelling of 131I-rituximab in the treatment of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and a case report of high dose 131I-rituximab-BEAM conditioning autologous transplant," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Patient eligibility Patients with histologically proven refractory/relapsed CD20+ indolent or aggressive NHL, who had either exhausted available options of curative treatment or were chemo-sensitive but unable to receive autologous HSCT as the recommended treatment due to unfitness, failed peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization or financial constraint. Other inclusion criteria were (i) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0–2 or Karnofsky Scale 60–100%, (ii) life expectancy longer than three months, (iii) absolute neutrophil count of 1.5×109/L or more, (iv) platelet count of 100×109/L or more, preferably 150×109/L or more, (v) bone marrow involvement less than 25% (if there was marrow involvement during initial disease work-out, a repeat marrow examination would be done before 131I-rituximab), (vi) bilirubin less than 1.5 upper limit of normal, aspartate transaminase less than five times of upper limit of normal, creatinine less than 1.5 time of upper limit of normal, (vii) no active obstructive hydronephrosis and (viii) at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Eligible patients were counselled for verbal consent and the cases were discussed in the multi-disciplinary board involving Haematology, Nuclear Medicine, Pharmacy and Nursing. Once the board deemed the case as suitable, the Haematologist and Nuclear Physician would counsel patients again to get written informed consent. Patients were scheduled for 131I-rituximab in Sarawak General Hospital (SGH) from August to October 2014.   2.2 Treatment process and monitoring The treatment process is illustrated in  Fig. 1 below. Patient no. 7 in  Table 1 received combination of high dose 131I-rituximab (6000MBq or 163mCi) and BEAM conditioning regime autologous HSCT. The high dose 131I-rituximab (6000MBq or 163mCi) was given on Day -18 in SGH and BEAM was started on Day -7 in Ampang Hospital. The amount of Lugol's iodine was initially planned at 10 drops per day. Later, it was increased to 15 drops per day and patient no. 7 in Table 1 received 20 drops per day in view of the higher dose of 131I-rituximab used. The baseline investigations included full blood count (FBC), liver function test (LFT), renal profile (RP), calcium (Ca), phosphate (PO4), magnesium (Mg), uric acid (UA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), thyroid function test (TFT) and Hepatitis B core total antibody (if Hepatitis B surface antigen was negative). Tablet paracetamol 1g and syrup promethazine 15mg were given as premedication half an hour prior to rituximab. The follow-up was scheduled under Haematology weekly starting at 0.5 till 7.5 weeks and 2.5 till 7.5 weeks after Day 7 to monitor FBC, LFT, RP, LDH and TFT for indolent and aggressive NHL, respectively. The follow-up under Nuclear Medicine is scheduled at 4.5 and 8.5 weeks. The treating Haematologist and Nuclear Physician would decide other investigations and additional/subsequent follow-up interval at their own discretion. We used guideline (Cheson et al., 2014) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version four to define the response to treatment and adverse events, respectively. We were unable to subject every patient to positron emission tomography computed tomography (PETCT) because not every patient can afford the charge and travel expenditure (it was not locally available) and limited access because only one Ministry of Health hospital (Selayang Hospital) provided the service.   2.3 In-house Radio-labelling of 131I-rituximab Rituximab, 15mg, was radio-labelled at SGH with I-131 sodium iodide using chloramine-T method at room temperature. Labelling procedure and quality control are described in   Tables 2 and 3, respectively Labelling efficiency was more than 98%. Rituximab was labelled for four minutes, with 20µg Chloramine-T per mg protein, using desired amount of I-131, either 500MBq (dosimetry studies) or 5 GBq (therapy) of I-131 (30 or 333MBq/mg protein respectively). Sodium thiosulphate was added subsequently to quench the reaction (3:1M ratio to Chloramine T). The mixture was purified on a disposable Sephadex G-25M gel NAP-10 column, which had been flushed with sterile saline. Upon completion of radio-labelling, the end product was ultra-filtered through a 0.22µm Millipore sterile filter into a sterile vial. Radiochemical purity was measured using Instant Thin Layer Chromatography (ITLC) developed with 85% methanol, via either dose calibrator or gamma camera. Prescribed therapeutic activity of radio-labelled antibody was dispensed into a 10mL syringe shielded by at least 15mm thick lead. Administration of radiolabelled antibody was performed using a lead block shielded saline primed infusion pump. Prior to dosimetry studies and therapy, desired activity of 131I-rituximab was administered intravenously following a loading dose of 375mg/m2 unlabelled rituximab. The patient was admitted and isolated in the radioiodine ward until the exposure rate reached the legal discharge limit for I-131. Whole body and finger radiation exposures of radiolabelling personnel and nuclear medicine physician were measured by pen dosimeter, thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) batch and ring during the procedures (Turner et al., 2003). Whole body imaging and background scans were acquired on a dual-head gamma camera, in the same geometry at one hour, three and five days respectively. The residence time was calculated by plotting the geometric mean counts at the three time points. The therapy activity of 131I- rituximab was calculated to deliver mean prescribed dose (MPD) of 0.75Gy to whole body. Dose escalation studies (Wahl et al., 1998; Kaminski et al., 2000; Boucek and Turner, 2005) have shown that radiation absorbed dose to the bone marrow (critical organ) of 2Gy and bone marrow dosimetry to correspond to a whole-body radiation dose of approximately 0.75Gy of 131I-anti-CD20 ensure safety and effectiveness RIT. The patients were pre-medicated with Lugol's iodine to protect the thyroid glands. Lugol's iodine was commenced 24h prior to the dosimetry studies and was continued for at least two week post 131I-rituximab administration (Leahy and Turner, 2011). Radioiodination of Rituximab with Chloramine T method is well established (Turner et al., 2003). Another method of radioiodination is by iodogen method (Illidge et al., 2009), which will not be discussed here. There are two crucial factors affecting the immunoreactivity and affinity of radiolabelled monoclonal antibody: a) chemical reaction and b) radiation reaction. The chemical reactions are due to oxidizing and reducing agents. Chloramine-T is a mild oxidizing agent which causes oxidation of radioiodine and enables covalent binding of the halogen to the monoclonal antibody. The radiohalogen is oxidized to a reactive specie, which attacks the most electronegative site on the antibody. Subsequently, linkage of the radiohalogen on the tyrosine residues ortho to the hydroxyl group predominates at a neutral pH (Fraker and Speck, 1978). Chloramine-T causes denaturation of monoclonal antibody if exposure is prolonged. It can affect the integrity of the monoclonal antibody which can decrease the binding affinity to the target antigen. Reducing agent, sodium thiosulphate is required to terminate the reaction. Sulphate based reducing agent reduces amino acids residues of the monoclonal antibody and contributes to a loss of immunoreactivity (Weadock et al., 1990; Robles et al., 2001; Visser et al., 2001).  Schaffland et al. (2004) had demonstrated the relationship between specific activity and immunoreactivity using two different specific activities of I-131 labelled rituximab (32.8MBq/mg versus 169.7MBq/mg). Higher immunoreactivity was observed at a lower specific activity of I-131 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Schaffland et al., 2004). A radiohalogen such as I-131 is a relatively large atom. Incorporation of such a large atom into a monoclonal antibody may cause a disruption of the structure, leading to reduced binding affinity. This is significant in a higher specific activity in view of a higher number of incorporated atoms. Therefore, correlation of amino acid molecular sequence, specific activity (radionuclide/antibody ratio) and the immunoreactivity are essential in the success of radio-labelling, the development of effective therapeutic or diagnostic applications (Weadock et al., 1990). Gel-filtration helps to terminate the chemical reactions with additional advantage of purification of the radiolabelled monoclonal antibody from residual radioiodine and Chloramine T. Therefore, the ratio of the reactants, and the timing of the radioiodination and purification have to be performed accordingly to optimize the immunoreactivity and affinity of the radiolabelled monoclonal antibody.

The patient developed a painless swelling in the edentulous area after four months of dental extraction. Intraorally a swelling was noted in the socket of right mandibular molar. General physical examination revealed no cervical lymphadenopathy, and there was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or anemia. X-ray revealed a radiolucent unilocular well circumscribed lesion in the mandible in relation to right lower molar socket (Fig. 1 ). Contrast enhanced computed tomography scan showed a 2cm×2cm homogeneously enhancing expansile lesion in the mandible with involvement of adjacent gingivobuccal sulcus (Fig. 2 ). Incisional biopsy of the gingival lesion was performed for histopathologic evaluation which was reported at a private center, as poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient underwent segmental mandibulectomy with right supra-omohyoid neck dissection. Gross examination revealed a 2cm×2cm grayish white growth involving the gingivobuccal sulcus and infiltrating into the underlying mandible. Histopathological examination of the resected mandible showed sheets of large neoplastic cells with abundant dense eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm and centrally or eccentrically placed nuclei with single prominent nucleoli or several small nucleoli (Figs. 3 and 4  ). The mitotic rate was brisk, averaging 10 mitotic figures per 10 high power field. Immunohistochemistry was strongly and diffusely positive for CD38, CD138, Vimentin and Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and negative for pancytokeratin, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD19, CD79a, CD20, CD30, CD10, Bcl6, CD56, ALK-1 and kappa light chain. The tumor cells showed lambda chain restriction (Fig. 5 ). The blastic morphology and plasma cell-like immunophenotype features helped to establish a diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma. The resected lymph nodes showed evidence of granulomatous inflammation. No acid fast bacilli or caseous necrosis was noted. His CD4 cell count was 300/mm3. Further staging workup including bone marrow aspirate and biopsy did not reveal any evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia or metastatic deposit of PBL. No other evidence of metastatic disease was present. Laboratory studies showed normal chemistries, mildly elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase at 225IU/L [normal<190IU/L] and normal serum beta-2 microglobulin. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. The patient was put on CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincrisrtine, doxorubicin and prednisolone) regimen and excellent response was noted to the therapy. "

She was diagnosed as having stage IIIB [cT2bN3M0] lung adenocarcinoma and began receiving first-line chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin (60mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500mg/m2) every 4 weeks. After two cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy, a reduction in her renal function status was noted. Therefore, the cisplatin was changed to carboplatin (AUC=5). After two cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed, a partial response was observed. Therefore, maintenance therapy using pemetrexed was subsequently performed for 11 cycles. After 11 cycles of pemetrexed, she developed hoarseness. An FDG-PET examination revealed new metastases in the hilar, mediastinal, and abdominal lymph nodes. As the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 [EML4]-ALK gene re-arrangement was detected using both immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization in a trans-bronchial lung biopsy specimen of the primary lesion collected at the time of diagnosis, alectinib was administered orally at 600mg/day as a second-line therapy. Ten days after the administration of alectinib, a skin rash appeared on both forearms. The next day, the skin rash had spread to the trunk (Grade 3) (Fig. 1 ). At that time, she was not taking any other prescribed medicines expect for alectinib; moreover, she had no prior history of allergies and did not have any clinical findings suggesting that the skin rash was associated with an infectious disease. A skin biopsy of a left forearm specimen revealed the perivascular infiltrations of histiocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the upper dermis (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, we diagnosed the skin rash as being an adverse effect of alectinib. Treatment with alectinib was discontinued, and an antihistamine and topical steroids were administered instead. One week later, the skin rash had almost entirely disappeared. Four weeks after the discontinuation of alectinib, we carefully performed oral desensitization for alectinib. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the desensitization procedure. She was treated as an inpatient using a 5-step oral desensitization protocol, as described in Table 1 . The desensitization started at 40mg with a doubling of each subsequent administration of alectinib until a final dose of 600mg was reached. A total of 600mg of alectinib was given in five steps over 9days (Table 1). The patient has since continued alectinib treatment (600mg/day, orally) for seven months and has shown no recurrence of the rash or disease progression during that time. "

He also complained of symmetric polyarthritis in his hands (metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints), wrists and right ankle, together with 2 painless, rubbery, mobile lymph nodes measuring 2cm×2cm, 1 axillary and the other inguinal. He had normocytic, normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9g/dL, 2700×mm3 leukocytes (1210×mm3 neutrophils and 697×mm3 lymphocytes), 173,000×mm3 platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 110mm/h, creatinine level of 1.85mg/dL, and urinalysis revealed abundant erythrocytes and proteinuria. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies and rheumatoid factor (RF) were negative; cryoglobulins were weakly positive, complement C3 was normal and C4 was 1.3mg/dL (normal: 10–40). Serologic tests for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C were negative. His creatinine level rose to 3.36mg/dL, and he received three 500-mg doses of methylprednisolone for the treatment of glomerulonephritis with acute renal failure. This was followed by 60mg/day of prednisone, and his fever and polyarthritis remitted, and his creatinine level decreased to 0.77mg/dL. Computed tomography revealed supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes measuring 2.5cm and mild splenomegaly. With this situation of renal failure and glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology, after the third dose of methylprednisolone, renal biopsy was performed. One week later, the axillary lymph node was biopsied. The first revealed glomerulonephritis with deposition of immune complexes and complement factors (Fig. 1b), with an acute diffuse proliferative pattern and membranoproliferative changes (Fig. 1a). In addition, the ultrastructural study showed glomerular electron dense deposits with substructural organization (Fig. 1d). Two weeks later, while the patient was still receiving steroid therapy, his fever, renal failure and progressive pancytopenia reappeared. Methylprednisolone was again administered but, this time, without response. Finally, the lymph node biopsy revealed the presence of mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (Fig. 2a), with bone marrow infiltration (Fig. 2c). Chemotherapy was begun with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. One month later, the patient's renal function was completely normal and, after 6 months of follow-up, he is in complete remission, with a normal blood cell count and a creatinine level of 1.12mg/dL.

Because abnormal increase of the serum (1 ? 3)-?-D-glucan (310.9 pg/mL, normal range is less than 11 pg/mL) and a yeast infection were detected in the blood which had been obtained on the 14th day. The serum C. neoformans antigen was higher than 1:4096. On the same day, she was referred to our Department of Ophthalmology because of suspicious fungal infection. The examination on the bed showed that her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 14/20 in the right eye (OD) and 16/20 in the left eye (OS). The intraocular pressure was 13 mmHg OD and 15 mmHg OS, and the pupils were round and reactive without an afferent pupillary defect. She had mild cataract in both eyes. There was no anterior chamber inflammation or anterior vitritis. There were no findings suggesting fungal endophthalmitis, although Roth spots that was thought to be caused by ATLL were observed in both eyes. On the 20th day, intrathecal triple therapy with CVP (50% dose of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) for ATLL was administered following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection for culture. Soon after the treatment, she reported an acute deterioration in her vision without headache or vomiting. The ophthalmic examinations on the same day showed that her BCVA was 8/20 OD and 4/20 OS. Slit-lamp examination revealed mild anterior chamber reaction in both eyes. Multiple yellow-white lesions and hemorrhages without papilledema were observed in the posterior pole, and a round, shallow serous macular detachment was present in both eyes (Fig. 2 ). Fluorescein angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction and poor general condition. However, in OCT images, corresponding area of the serous retinal detachment showed the subretinal cystoid space separated by membranous structures and septa, and the chorioscleral border was blurred in both eyes (Fig. 2). The patient was diagnosed as having fungal infection in choroid and caspofungin was replaced by fosfluconazole (F-FLCZ, loading dose 800 mg) because of intraocular penetration (The treatment regimen at this point was prednisolone + cefepime + F-FLCZ). Two days after CSF collection (on the 22nd day), budding yeasts were seen on an India ink preparation of the CSF. C. neoformans was recovered from cultures of the blood and CSF Investigations for other pathogens including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, toxoplasma, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. An x-ray of her chest and a CT scan of her head were normal. Based on the clinical findings, positive microscopic examination, and India ink test results, the patient was diagnosed with cryptococcal choroiditis. F-FLCZ was discontinued and intravenous administration of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB: 200 mg/day) and oral administration of flucytosine (6 g/day) were started (The treatment regimen was prednisolone + cefepime + L-AMB + flucytosine at this point). Her weight was 35 kg. On the 27th day, five days after the introduction of L-AMB and flucytosine, the flucytosine had to be stopped because of bone marrow depression. On the 41st day, after another two-week continuation of the L-AMB therapy, the choroidal lesions had little improved (Fig. 3 ), and the inflammation in the anterior segment had rather increased. Although OCT scans showed a decrease in the macular serous detachment, scans performed on yellow-white lesions revealed multiple bumps of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with hyper-reflectivity substances within the bumps. There were focal thickening in the choroid with low reflectivity of the inner choroid. In addition, the photoreceptor layer showed slight hyper-reflectivity (Fig. 3). The serum C. neoformans antigen remained high and the blood culture remained positive at this point. Based on the results of antifungal susceptibility tests, systemic F-FLCZ (800mg/day for 7 days, then 400 mg daily) was added and intravitreal injection of antifungal agent was performed on both eyes (100 ?g of Voriconazole OD and 10 ?g of L-AMB OS). On the 45th day, four days after beginning of the new treatment protocol (L-AMB + F-FLCZ + one intravitreal injection of antifungal agent), the choroidal lesions showed some resolution with hypopigmentation changes. Intrathecal triple therapy with CVP (50% dose of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) for ATLL was administered. On the 75th day, after the four-week combination therapy of L-AMB and F-FLCZ, anterior inflammation and choroiditis gradually improved. The serum (1 ? 3)-?-D-glucan level decreased to 6.5 pg/mL and the blood culture was negative. Intravenous L-AMB was discontinued and mogamulizumab was started for the ATLL. Intravenous administration of F-FLCZ was switched to oral FLCZ. On the 120th day, her BCVA had improved to 12/20 OD and 10/20 OS. OCT scans showed a resolution of the macular serous detachment, however there was blurring of both interdigitation zone (IZ) and ellipsoid zone (EZ) except in the central foveal region. The RPE bumping and focal thickening of the choroid were decreased, but the reflectivity of the RPE bumps was increased (Fig. 4 ). On the 180th day, administration of oral FLCZ was stopped because of impaired renal function. There was a resolution of the choroidal lesions and hemorrhages without recurrences, thereafter. Nevertheless, her condition deteriorated despite chemotherapy and treatment and she died for ATLL on the 240th day after hospitalization. The cryptococcal strain isolated from the blood and CSF was identified as C. neoformans var. grubii by analyzing the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions [10]. Multi-locus sequence typing based on the sequence analysis of a set of polymorphic loci revealed that the isolate was molecular type ST5 [10]. The minimal inhibitory concentrations to amphotericin B, flucytosine, FLCZ, itraconazole, miconazole, micafungin, and VRCZ were 0.25, 4, 4, 0.06, 0.25, >16, and 0.06 ?g/mL respectively. This study was approved by the institutional review board and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. "
76,S0046-8177(17)30439-2,Composite lymphoma of follicular B-cell and peripheral T-cell types with distinct zone distribution in a 75-year-old male patient: a case study," 2 Case report  2.1 Clinical presentation A 75-year-old white man initially presented to his primary care physician for right neck swelling. He complained of slight fatigue but did not experience fevers, chills, night sweats, or significant weight loss. His medical history was remarkable for osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes that was medically controlled. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated generalized lymphadenopathy involving bilateral cervical, mediastinal, paratracheal, and iliac lymph nodes. A subsequent excisional biopsy of a left neck lymph node revealed a T-cell lymphoma with concurrent atypical follicular hyperplasia. A staging bone marrow examination showed no evidence of lymphomatous involvement. After this diagnosis, the patient was treated with combination chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, and prednisone. After completing 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, and prednisone, the patient felt excessive fatigue and anorexia and had a significant unintentional weight loss of 35 lb. At this time, positron-emission tomographic/computed tomographic scan revealed persistent lymphadenopathy involving cervical, mediastinal, para-aortic, bilateral iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes, with many showing prominent fluorodeoxyglucose avid uptake. The patient was evaluated for more aggressive therapy, but because of his poor performance status and comorbidities, he was considered an unsuitable candidate for high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant rescue. The patient was referred to a clinical trial and transferred to another health care institution at the time this article was prepared.      2.2 Pathologic findings Histologic examination of the cervical lymph node biopsy showed marked alteration of the nodal architecture with a prominent lymphoid proliferation. At low magnification, one could appreciate expansion of the interfollicular areas and a scattered increase in lymphoid follicles (Fig. 1A). The follicles were composed of a homogeneous population of small lymphocytes with cleaved or irregular nuclei and scant cytoplasm. They lacked polarity and tingible body macrophages. Mantle zones were either absent or markedly diminished. Cells occupying the interfollicular areas were medium to large in size, with round, oval, or irregular nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and scant to moderate cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). In addition, interfollicular areas contained scattered background small lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and increased vascularity. Mitoses were rarely seen; however, apoptotic bodies were frequently noted in interfollicular areas. Immunohistochemical analyses with anti-CD20 (Fig. 1C) and anti-CD3 (Fig. 1D) exhibited B cells located primarily in lymphoid follicles, and T cells distributed within interfollicular areas. Of note, T cells in interfollicular areas aberrantly expressed CD20 (weak), and they appeared larger than follicular B cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, interfollicular T cells were positive for CD4 (Fig. 1E), PD1 (Fig. 1F), and BCL6 (heterogeneous). CD8 stain showed scattered rare positive cells in the interfollicular areas. CD21 and CD23 stains highlighted a well-formed follicular dendritic meshwork underneath the lymphoid follicles, and CD34/CD31 showed increased vascularity in interfollicular areas. Additional B-cell antigen stains, including PAX5 (Fig. 1G), OCT2 (Fig. 1H), CD79a (Fig. 1I), and CD19 (Supplementary Figure), demonstrated positive staining in lymphoid follicles and essentially negative staining in interfollicular lymphoid cells. Although the follicular lymphocytes were positive for CD10 (Fig. 1J), interfollicular T cells were negative. BCL2 stain demonstrated a dual staining pattern with strong expression in follicular B cells and weak- to moderate-intensity staining in interfollicular T cells (Fig. 1K). Ki67 stain showed a relatively high proliferative index in interfollicular areas, whereas lymphoid follicles appeared low in proliferation. CD30, CD15, and ALK1 were essentially negative. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) small RNA was positive in scattered cells in the interfollicular areas. Immunohistochemical analyses with anti-CD20 (Fig. 1C) and anti-CD3 (Fig. 1D) exhibited B cells located primarily in lymphoid follicles, and T cells distributed within interfollicular areas. Of note, T cells in interfollicular areas aberrantly expressed CD20 (weak), and they appeared larger than follicular B cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, interfollicular T cells were positive for CD4 (Fig. 1E), PD1 (Fig. 1F), and BCL6 (heterogeneous). CD8 stain showed scattered rare positive cells in the interfollicular areas. CD21 and CD23 stains highlighted a well-formed follicular dendritic meshwork underneath the lymphoid follicles, and CD34/CD31 showed increased vascularity in interfollicular areas. Additional B-cell antigen stains, including PAX5 (Fig. 1G), OCT2 (Fig. 1H), CD79a (Fig. 1I), and CD19 (Supplementary Figure), demonstrated positive staining in lymphoid follicles and essentially negative staining in interfollicular lymphoid cells. Although the follicular lymphocytes were positive for CD10 (Fig. 1J), interfollicular T cells were negative. BCL2 stain demonstrated a dual staining pattern with strong expression in follicular B cells and weak- to moderate-intensity staining in interfollicular T cells (Fig. 1K). Ki67 stain showed a relatively high proliferative index in interfollicular areas, whereas lymphoid follicles appeared low in proliferation. CD30, CD15, and ALK1 were essentially negative. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) small RNA was positive in scattered cells in the interfollicular areas. Corresponding flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an atypical T-cell population (41%) with CD4 subset restriction and partial loss of CD7, as well as an abnormal B-cell population (37%) with expression of CD20 and CD10 without definitive CD19 or surface immunoglobulin light chains. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based gene rearrangement analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue demonstrated clonal rearrangements of the TCRG (Fig. 2A) and IGH genes (Fig. 2B). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the IGH/BCL2 fusion gene was also performed on the paraffin-embedded tissue section. When targeted on the fields with aggregates of small cells, nuclei with the IGH/BCL2 fusion gene accounted for 78% of the total interphase nuclei (Fig. 3A). In contrast, targeted FISH on the fields beyond the small cell aggregates demonstrated only rare IGH/BCL2 fusions and instead showed nuclei with extra signals for the IGH probe (amplifications of IGH gene or trisomy/tetrasomy 14), which accounted for 54% of the total interphase nuclei in the field (Fig. 3B). Thus, a diagnosis of CL of T-cell (PTCL, not otherwise specified) and B-cell origin (follicular lymphoma) was established.  "
77,S1878-8750(15)01540-5,Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase–Negative Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma Manifesting as a Scalp Hematoma After an Acute Head Injury—a Case Report and Literature Review," Case Description An 84-year-old man fell and hurt his head on a closet 5 days before visiting our hospital. The right posterior occipital region of his head began to swell and grew into an intolerably painful mass with an ulcerated lesion, and a severe headache had persisted since then (Figure 1A ). Brain computed tomography revealed a right posterior occipital scalp hematoma (Figure 1B). Secondary infectious cellulitis was believed to be present, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antibiotic agents were prescribed for 5 days. However, the mass did not shrink, and very sharp, painful sensations began to occur, so the patient was admitted for surgical intervention. The patient had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as peripheral arterial occlusive disease under poor medication control for >20 years. He had experienced 3 episodes of ischemic stroke within the last 6 months. Physical examination was notable for an ulcerated painful mass of 20 cm × 10 cm × 1.5 cm over the region of the right occipital area. There were no palpable cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes or B symptoms during this period. Laboratory examination revealed a normal complete blood cell count with no leukocytosis and no thrombocytopenia. The LDH level was 205 U/L (reference range, 140–271 U/L), and all other biochemistry profiles were within the reference limits. No microorganism was identified on bacterial and fungal cultures. Because conservative treatments had failed, the patient underwent neurosurgical intervention. Serology tests for human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) were positive. A bone marrow biopsy showed no anaplastic cell infiltration. Hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small nuclear RNA was negative. A T cell receptor rearrangement test showed monoclonal T gamma cell gene rearrangement. A whole-body bone scan showed a negative result, but a whole-body positron emission tomography scan revealed an intensely fluorodeoxyglucose-avid scalp mass over the right posterior occipital region (Figure 1C). Pathology revealed a high-grade malignant lymphoma; immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for CD3, CD5, CD30, CD45RO, epithelial membrane antigen, and Ki-67, but staining was negative for CD20, CD79a, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, CK, myeloperoxidase, and ALK (Figure 2 ). Based on the above-mentioned examination results and clinical manifestations, ALK? ALCL, stage IE, was diagnosed according to the Ann Arbor Staging system. A hematologist and a radiation oncologist were consulted about concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The patient received bendamustine and dexamethasone chemotherapy. He also underwent radiation therapy to the scalp lesion (45 Gy in 29 fractions). However, 2 months later, the patient died of hospital-acquired pneumonia with sepsis. "

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed by using the following commercial antibodies: CD3, CD5, CD10, CD20, CD43, CD79a, CD138, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and ? and ? immunoglobulin light chains. Immunostaining with PAB antibody was also performed as previously reported [1].   2.2 PCR for detection of IGH gene rearrangement PCR analyses were performed with the IGH Gene Clonality Assay (Invivoscribe Technologies, San Diego, CA) and the ABI Fluorescence Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) by using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.

He did not smoke or drink alcohol. His initial CD4+ count was 326 cells/?L, and his HIV viral load was 47,000 copies/mL. He began HAART, consisting of a single-pill triple formulation of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. With the exception of a chronic and nonproductive cough, he remained well, with a nondetectable HIV viral load and a CD4+ count typically > 400 cells/?L. In 2011, he sought further evaluation for a persistent cough. His workup included pulmonary function tests and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen. The findings from the initial studies proved unremarkable and consistent with a sensitivity to environmental allergens. Although the CT images through the chest were unremarkable, the abdominal views revealed an incidental finding of a retroperitoneal mass several centimeters in size. He was followed up conservatively, and during a 3-year period, the mass slowly enlarged. During this time, the patient remained afebrile, with normal blood test findings, including sedimentation rate, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CD4+ cell count, and a consistently nondetectable HIV viral load. In 2015, he was referred back to medical oncology for reassessment. He was feeling well and was without fever, night sweats, or weight loss. His physical examination findings were negative for peripheral adenopathy, visceromegaly, elevated neck veins, abdominal distension, and diminished lung sounds. His blood studies, including complete blood count, full chemistry and liver panels, sedimentation rate, and serum LDH, were all within the broad range of normal. His CD4+ count was 947 cells/?L; he had a nondetectable HIV viral load; and his Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV stage was A1. The serum HHV-8 viral load by polymerase chain reaction was 9500 copies/mL. A whole body fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT scan showed the previously identified portacaval mass had enlarged to 43 × 64 mm and was markedly hypermetabolic, with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 16.5. An additional, mildly hypermetabolic, 10- × 13-mm left paratracheal lymph node with a SUV of 3.0 was identified (Figure 1 , A and B). Owing to the now-prominent size of the mass and its intense SUV reading, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and excisional biopsy of the portacaval mass. The lymph node showed reactive morphologic characteristics reminiscent of Castleman lymphadenopathy (eg, onion skinning of the mantle zone, small atrophic follicles, increased plasma cells) interspersed with large cells with abundant cytoplasm and prominent and round nuclei. The Ki-67 labeling index was 90%. Immunohistochemical studies showed that these large cells stained positive for pan-B cell antigen CD20 and negative for CD138, CD10, BCL-6, CD3, and CD30. Malignant cells were also coinfected with HHV-8 and EBV (Figure 2 ). He was diagnosed with the rare HHV-8-LBL PEL variant. His bone marrow biopsy showed moderate hypercellularity but no obvious lymphoma. The patient was treated with R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, prednisone) infusional chemotherapy in an AIDS Malignancy Consortium clinical trial. 10  During his first rituximab infusion, he experienced significant rigor, chills, and hypotension. Ten days later, he was hospitalized with neutropenic fever and enterovirus-induced gastroenteritis. He received intravenous fluids, empiric antibiotics, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and recovered uneventfully. His next 3 cycles of chemotherapy were uncomplicated, and a repeat fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT scan showed a complete radiographic response. He received a total of 6 cycles of infusional chemotherapy. This was tolerated well, with the exception of a moderately severe lower extremity sensorial-motor neuropathy and fingertip paresthesia, which led to the elimination of vincristine during his final 2 cycles of chemotherapy. He also experienced short-lived dysphonia, which, from a laryngoscope examination, was thought to have resulted from vocal cord atrophy. He responded well to conservative care and voice exercises. At the 12-month follow-up examination, he remained in complete remission (CR), with a CD4+ count of 665 cells/?L and nondetectable viral loads for both HHV-8 and HIV. "
81,S0967-5868(17)31297-3,Spinal primary central nervous system lymphoma: Case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 45?year-old gentleman was admitted in our neurology department, who presented with one-year history of progressive tremor in the left limbs and slight dysarthria as well as three-month history of paraparesis, tinnitus and insomnia. He then developed severe dysarthria, sialorrhea, incompetent closure of the eyelids, constipation, atrophy in the left limbs as well as paralysis and numbness in the left lower limb in two months. CSF test revealed normal pressure, slightly decreased glucose (3.0?mmol/L in the CSF, 8.0?mmol/L in the plasma) and strikingly increased protein (18,962?mg/L). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the swollen cerebellum and cauda equine, with enhancement in both meninges and nerve roots (Fig. 1 ). The electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal. Out of the fear of surgery, the patient refused to take biopsy of cauda equine. According to the epidemiology consult, the tubercular meningitis was suspected and the anti-tuberculosis recipe including Isoniazid (0.6?g QD), Rifampicin (450?mg QD), Pyrazinamide (1500?mg QD) and Ethambutol Hydrochloride (750?mg QD) in concomitant with the intrathecal injection of isoniazid and dexamethasone was prescribed. The next three lumbar punctures during treatment all disclosed normal pressure, mild increased cell count (300–700?*?10^6/L), extremely high quality of protein (an average of 25,000?mg/L) in the CSF. After two weeks of anti-tuberculosis therapy, no improvement had been approached and the patient was even admitted in our ICU due to respiratory failure. On examination in ICU, he was alert and orientated. Neurological examination demonstrated complete left peripheral facial paralysis, dysphagia, bucking, paraparesis and amyotrophy in all four limbs with flaccidity. The rest of neurological examination was unremarkable. The laboratory tests for blood WBC, lymphocyte, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), malignancy tumor biomarkers, tubercular antibody (PPD-IgG), T-spot and HIV were all negative. The serum lactate dehrdrogenase (LDH) was slightly increased. CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis were all negative. The repeated epidemiology consult after admitted in ICU excluded the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the anti-tuberculosis drugs were then suspended. The fifth lumbar puncture suggested too little CSF to gain, which might attribute to the excessive swollen cauda equine. We hence creatively improved the conventional methods of lumbar puncture. Two needles were punctured separately but simultaneously in the L3/4 and L4/5 intervertebral spaces. Isotonic saline (0.9%) was injected from L3/4 to wash the cauda equine and diluted CSF was gained at L4/5(Fig. 2 a). Cytological examination of CSF revealed abundant of lymphocytes with macronucleoli (Fig. 2b and c). Hematology consult was placed and suggested PCNSL. The flow cytometric analysis was required for definitive diagnosis. Unfortunately, the patient and his family refused further medical intervention for economical reasons. He discharged after six-day ICU hospitalization and passed away two weeks later. "
83,S1341-321X(18)30028-X,A case of Epstein–Barr virus-negative human immunodeficiency virus-related primary effusion lymphoma," 2 Case presentation  2.1 Clinical findings A 49-year-old Japanese man was referred and admitted to our hospital with cough, fever, malaise, and weight loss of 10 kg over the past 6 months. He had no significant past medical history except for allergic dermatitis. On physical examination, vital signs were stable with a body temperature 37.2 °C, pulse rate 90 beats/min, blood pressure 129/81 mmHg, and respiratory rate 15 breaths/min; oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 96% on room air. We observed decreased breath sounds at the lung bases bilaterally, and palpable cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was no lower extremity pitting edema and no skin rash other than a purpuric eruption on the plantar aspect of the left foot. The initial findings on laboratory investigation are shown in Table 1 . Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed massive bilateral compressive pleural effusion and no significant lung involvement or hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1 ). HIV antibody screening on suspicion of cachexia because of severe emaciation was positive, and further examination revealed a viral load of 110,000 copies/mL and CD4 count of 31 cells/?L. He had a history of multiple sexual partners more than 10 years earlier and denied having sex with men. Thoracentesis was performed and pleural fluid cytology revealed malignant lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake confined to the pleura only; there was no uptake in other parts of the body (Fig. 2 ). In addition, pathological evaluation of the left plantar skin lesion and inguinal lymph nodes biopsy specimens revealed Kaposi sarcoma (KS). Thus, we made a definitive diagnosis of PEL, possibly AIDS-related lymphoma (see Table 2 ).   2.2 Histopathologic findings Pleural fluid cytopathology revealed large blastoid cells with enlarged nuclei. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the cells were positive for HHV-8 latent nuclear antigen-1 (LANA-1), CD30 and CD138 but negative for CD20 (Fig. 3 ). These results were consistent with a diagnosis of PEL. Subsequently, a new PEL cell line was established with the cells obtained from the plural fluid. The cells showed gourd-shaped morphology with a polarized nucleus, expressing CD38, CD138 and Blimp-1, but not CD19 and CD20. Polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the cells were negative for EBV. Chromosomal analysis revealed that the karyotype of the cells was 46, XY, +del(7)(q32), +8, der(8)t(8;8)(p21;q13)ins(8;?)(p21;?) × 2, 13, add(15)(p11), der(21;22)(q10;q10) [8].   2.3 Clinical course The patient's general condition was relatively stable and respiratory excursions were within normal range. The bilateral pleural effusion was controlled by repeated single large-volume thoracentesis. Subsequently, we first initiated cART comprising emtricitabine/tenofovir plus raltegravir on the 11th day of admission. However, high-grade fever, seemed to be due to PEL, that developed on admission persisted for 3 weeks after initiation of treatment and so we started the first course of chemotherapy with the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen on the 33rd day of admission. Immediately after the CHOP therapy, the fever resolved (<37 °C) and the pleural effusion showed no tendency to increase. However, his performance status (PS) decreased as the treatment was continued. The chemotherapy was discontinued in the third course because of decline in PS. On the 92nd day, the complete blood counts showed thrombocytopenia. Coagulation tests revealed deceased in fibrinogen level and prothrombin percentage activity, and increase in FDP level. The calculated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis was 5, which made diagnosis of DIC. Although there was no evidence of infection such as CMV infection or fungal infection, the fact that increase in procalcitonin level (2.80 ng/mL) suggested DIC associated with some bacterial infection. At the same time, liver and kidney failure had progressed. This indicated that multiple organ failure (MOF) was considered to have occurred. The cART also was ceased due to difficulty in oral administration; he died of MOF on the 95th day. A rise in LDH was not observed throughout the course of the case. Although the maximum level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) reached to 5620 IU/mL, a marked increase of that was not seen during the course. The present clinical course including various trends is shown in Fig. 4 .  "
84,S0168-8227(16)00066-8,Type 2 diabetic patient with a foot ulcer as initial manifestation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A case report," 2 Case report In February 2014, a 76-year-old man with type 2 diabetes since 1994 presented at our outpatient diabetic foot clinic complaining of a painful foot lesion which occurred some weeks before. Physical examination of the right foot showed the presence of an ulcer on its lateral side (Fig. 1 ). The wound bed was intensively vascularized and partially covered by hyperkeratosis. Ankle brachial pressure index was 1.1 and duplex scanning excluded the presence of peripheral arterial disease. Sampling was taken from the wound bed, with detection of methicillin sensible staphylococcus aureus. On the basis of these evaluations, the ulcer was graded B2 according to the Texas University Score System [9] and was then treated according to the International Working Group on Diabetic Foot guidelines [10]. The lesion was sharply debrided to remove hyperkeratosis and non-vital tissue. Systemic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate was promptly started. Local dressing consisted in silver-impregnated polyurethane foam, renewed every three days and offloading was obtained by a removable walker device rendered irremovable. Despite local and systemic therapies, we observed a progressive worsening in the condition of the ulcer. An ultrasound analysis of the region showed a hypo-echoic mass involving skin and subcutaneous tissues, hypervascularized in power Doppler analysis. A skin incisional biopsy was then performed which revealed the presence of DLBCL. Immunohistochemistry showed a strong positivity for CD20 marker (Figs. 2 and 3  ). Gene expression analysis revealed positivity for Bcl-6, Bcl-2 and MUM-1 and expression of Ki67 was detected in the 70% of the cells. Bone marrow biopsy of the right posterior iliac crest revealed the presence of normal hematopoietic elements. Computed Tomography scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed nodal inguinal involvement. The patient was treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) and received consolidation external radiation therapy for 8 weeks, achieving complete tumour regression and healing of the ulcer (Fig. 4 ).

85,S0145-2126(18)30076-6,Lifetime physical inactivity is associated with increased risk for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma: A case-control study," 2 Material and methods  2.1 Epidemiologic questionnaire and study population The study population for this hospital-based, case-control analysis was composed of individuals who participated in the Patient Epidemiology Data System (PEDS) and completed an epidemiologic questionnaire while receiving medical services at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center between 1989 and 1998. The PEDS questionnaire was a self-administered epidemiologic survey offered to all patients receiving medical service at Roswell Park and was completed within 6 months of diagnosis (median: 21?days) with a 50% response rate [19–22]. The Roswell Park Institutional Review Board approved the conduct of the study and all participants provided informed consent. Both HL and NHL cases were identified through the Roswell Park tumor registry. Cases included 87 individuals with primary, incident HL and 236 individuals with primary, incident NHL. Among NHL cases, 134 (56.78%) were diffuse NHL, 97 (41.10%) were follicular NHL, and five (2.12%) were categorized as other or unspecified types of NHL. Controls were sex- and age-matched via nearest neighbor sampling at a 1:4 case-control ratio [23]. Controls included 348 individuals for HL analyses and 952 individuals for NHL analyses identified from a pool of 10,642 potentially eligible controls who were seen at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center under suspicion of malignant disease but who were ultimately diagnosed with non-malignant conditions.   2.2 Lifetime recreational physical inactivity The PEDs questionnaire included a section on recreational physical activity with questions assessing age of initiation of activity, total duration of the activity in years, and frequency of the activity in times per week or month. The questionnaire defined ‘recreational physical activity’ as exercising for health or pleasure in activities such as jogging, walking, or aerobics. Congruent with the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, we defined physical inactivity, our exposure of interest, as the absence of regular, weekly, recreational physical activity [24]. Thus, participants reporting less than one weekly session of exercise, spanning all of the years preceding study enrollment, were classified as physically inactive. Conversely, those reporting at least one regular session of physical activity per week on average were classified as physically active.   2.3 Covariates and assessment of confounding Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), family history of lymphoma and smoking (pack-years) were identified a priori as important variables for adjustment. Potential confounding effects of additional variables such as decade of study enrollment and education level were assessed by the ten percent change-in-estimate method as described by Maldonado et al. [25]. For HL analyses, education level (less than high school, high school graduate, some higher education) met this criterion and was included as a covariate in the multivariate model. In NHL analyses, all additional variables failed to meet this criterion and were thus omitted from the multivariate model.   2.4 Statistical analyses Two tailed t-tests and Pearson’s ? 2 tests were used to compare descriptive characteristics between cases and controls. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression models were fit to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) describing the association between physical inactivity and risk of HL and NHL. Multivariate models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, education level, family history and smoking (pack-years) for HL analyses and age, sex, BMI, family history, and smoking (pack-years) for NHL analyses. Despite small stratified sample sizes, exploratory analyses were stratified by BMI (normal-weight versus overweight/obese) and smoking status (never, former, current) to evaluate for possible effect modification and formal tests for interaction between physical inactivity and these stratifying variables were conducted utilizing a cross-product term in multivariable models, with effect modification declared at p?<?0.01. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.2.2 [26]. All tests were two-sided and considered statistically significant at p?<?0.05. All analyses were confirmed by a second data-analyst using SPSS version 21.  "

She consulted a general dentist who referred her to our hospital. Clinical examination revealed a spontaneous pain in the right lower premolar region with numbness of the right lower lip. No facial or gingival swelling was observed (Fig. 1A and B). A panoramic radiograph showed that the bone trabeculation on the right side appeared relatively less dense than on the left side (Fig. 1C). A MRI depicted low intensity areas of the right mandible on T1-weighted and T2-weighted, while T2 STIR showed high intensity (Fig. 1D). A CT scan demonstrated a lower density of bone trabecular on the right side of mandible without erosion of the cortex (data not shown). The patient also noticed a small lump on right breast with pain. Needle biopsy revealed that it was possibly BL (Fig. 2A–C). This case presented chromosomal translocation of the c-myc gene: t(8;14)(q24;q32) detected by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), confirming BL (Fig. 2D). The fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) showed CD10, CD19, CD20, and ?-ch positive, but it was ?-ch negative, which verified this case of the matured B-cell lymphoma (data not shown). The patient subsequently underwent an extensive work-up at the hematology department and was diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma. The hematologist recommended six courses of hyper-CAVD chemotherapy with rituximab. After the full course of therapy, the patient continues to be free of any evidence of lymphoma.   2.2 Case 2 An 81-year-old man experienced pain and swelling of the right mandibular gingiva. He initially saw a general dentist and surgical drainage was done under the diagnosis of subperiosteal abscess. Because the symptoms did not improve after the surgical treatment, the patient was referred to our hospital for examination and treatment. Clinical examination revealed a swelling with skin reddish of the right lower cheek. Intraoral examination found swelling in the right lower buccal vestibule (Fig. 3A and B). The patient also developed a numbness of the right lower lip. A panoramic radiograph showed no apparent difference in the bone trabeculation between the right and the left side of mandible (Fig. 3C). A CT scan revealed the soft tissue mass around the right mandibular bone with destruction of the lateral cortex (Fig. 3D and E). A biopsy was performed, which was diagnosed as EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly (Fig. 3F–I). The patient was then referred to the hematology department for systemic work-up and management. The patient was then diagnosed with stage IV disease identified as lymphoma of the lung and mesentery as well as the mandibular bone. However, he wished to be treated at another facility near his home and family.   2.3 Case 3 A 63-year-old man consulted his dentist for the treatment of a toothache of the right upper premolar. Although he received dental treatment, the symptom failed to improve. During the next 2 months, the patient experienced numbness of the right upper maxilla. The patient returned to the dentist and was subsequently referred to our hospital. Clinical examination revealed numbness on the right upper gingiva. There was no facial or gingival swelling but tenderness at the right upper gingiva of the premolar region. Water's X-ray view revealed radiopaque on the right maxillary sinus (Fig. 4A). A CT scan showed that right maxillary sinus was full of lesion (Fig. 4B and C). A MRI was taken for further examination, which identified hypointense mass with fluid collection in maxillary sinus (data not shown). We performed a biopsy which revealed DLBCL. An extensive staging work-up revealed the disease was stage I lymphoma. The patient received R-CHOP chemotherapy with 40Gy of radiation which led to CR. To date, he continues to do well with no evidence of recurrence.   2.4 Case 4 A 77-year-old man noticed left facial swelling. He consulted a general dentist who prescribed antibiotics and recommended observation. However, the swelling continued to increase for a few more days, and then he was referred to our hospital. Intraoral examination revealed an elastic soft mass with normal color of mucosa in the left upper buccal vestibule. A CT image demonstrated expanding soft tissue mass with destruction of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus (Fig. 5A and B). An incisional biopsy was performed, which revealed DLBCL. An extensive work-up at the hematology department revealed stage II lymphoma. The patient elected to undergo treatment at another facility near his family. However he died of the disease.   2.5 Case 5 A 93-year-old woman saw her dentist to receive prosthetic treatment. However, the dentist noticed a mass in the anterior maxilla region. Subsequently, she was referred to our hospital for examination and treatment. There was facial swelling evident in the right lateral aspect of the nasal wing and the upper lip at the time of clinical examination. Intraoral examination revealed swelling of the anterior upper buccal vestibule. Palpable cervical lymphadenopathies were found especially in bilateral submandibular regions. A CT image revealed a large mass in the surrounding tissue of the maxillary bone. There was also partial destruction of the maxillary bone (Fig. 5C and D). A biopsy specimen identified this case as DLBCL. A complete systemic work-up showed the patient's disease was stage II lymphoma. The medical oncologist scheduled six courses of CHOP chemotherapy. However, the patient was able to complete only three courses of the chemotherapy because of cardiac dysfunction. Once the patient achieved CR, she developed a recurrence and died of the lymphoma.  "
89,S2213-0896(16)30028-7,Adult intussusception in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma following chemotherapy: A case report and literature review," 2 Discussion Intussusception is the telescoping of a proximal segment of the gastrointestinal tract within the lumen of the adjacent segment [1]. Adult intussusception is not common [2]. Adult intussusception can be classified as primary or idiopathic and secondary. Primary intussusception accounts for 8–20% cases and is more likely to occur in the small intestine, while secondary intussusception is associated with a pathological condition involving a lead point. The pathological condition includes a benign polyp, lipoma, appendix, Meckel's diverticulum, or a malignant tumor such as a primary or metastatic adenocarcinoma, gastro intestinal stromal tumor (GIST), leukemia, lymphoma, or carcinoid tumor [1,3,4]. A study found that location of adult intussusception is the small intestine that accounts for 50–88% cases and the large intestine that accounts for 12–50% cases. Malignant lesions as the pathological condition was found in 30% of cases that occur small intestine, and in 30–68% of cases that occur in large intestine. Malignant lesions as cause of large intestine intussusception are colon adecocarcinoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Malignant lesions as cause of small intestine intussusception are predominantly metastases. Primary small intestinal malignancy such as adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, GIST, or lymphoma rarely cause this condition [5]. The diagnosis of the patient in this case report was DLBCL, a varian of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). She had no abdominal pathology found on history, physical or ultrasound examination at the time of diagnosis of lymphoma. She had nausea, vomit, and abdominal pain a week prior to admission, at the same time she had undergone chemotherapy. Thus the complaints were thought to be side effects of her chemotherapy. On the second day the patient's abdomen was distended with tenderness on palpation and absence of bowel movement. Her plain abdominal radiology and CT scan confirmed an intussusception on the ileo-colica region. The gastrointestinal tract is one of the most common extranodal sites of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Approximately 80–90% of primary gastrointestinal tract lymphomas are of B-cell origin [6]. Gastrointestinal lymphoma could be a lead point of intussusception [7]. A review study found 36 cases of intussusception due to lymphoma. According to the location of intussusception, 24 were in the ileo-colica region, 10 were in the enteric region, and 2 were in the colica region. Thirty four were diagnosed with various types of NHL and two were diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) [8]. None of the reports found intussusception after chemotherapy. The location of intussusception in this patient was in the ileo-colica region, a location of most intussusception due to lymphoma. The unusual finding in this case report was the intussusception occurred eight days after the initiation of chemotherapy, which was the first to be reported. The summary of cases of intussusception following chemotherapy is described in  Table 1. Intussusception occuring after chemotherapy were reported in an acute myeloblastic leukemia patient, 16 days after induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine[9] and a sigmoid colon cancer patient after 28 days (2 courses) of chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil (mFOLFOX6) [10]. The leading point of intussusception could be a cancer metastatic mass in the intestine [13]. This mass occurred due to cancer infiltration and hyperplasia of a polypoid nature or by intramural extravasation of blood that formed a hematoma [14]. A hematoma could also occurred as the result of thrombocytopenia at presentation or after chemotherapy. Enlarged lymph nodes that were common in patients with colon cancer or acute leukemia, especially the lymphoblastic type could be the leading point of intussusception [13]. Intussusception that occurred after chemotherapy might had a leading point formed by leukemic infiltrate, edema or necrosis [15]. Other 2 cases of intussusception occurred in patients with stomach cancer [11] and glioblastoma multiforme [12], after the chemotherapies had been completed. In the case of stomach cancer, 4 years after completion of chemotherapy, intussusception occurred in the descending colon thought to be the recurrence of the stomach cancer. In the case of glioblastoma, 2 years after completion of chemotherapy, intussusception occurred in the ileo-colica region thought to be secondary malignancy in the form of therapy-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma after treatment with temozolomide. The possible explanation for the intussusception in this patient could be the same as the first two cases. Intussusception in this case occurred in the time when the chemotherapy began to take effect. The effect might formed a leading point of edema or necrosis of the cancer, lymphoma or leukemic mass or the metastatic mass in the intestine. Recurrence of cancer or secondary malignancy as in the last to cases of intussusception would be unlikely in this patient. The possibility of second malignancy in the intestine would also be unlikely, as there were no findings in history, physical examination and abdominal ultrasound of it before the chemotherapy. The definite cause of intussusception in this patient could not be determined, as no surgical intervention or autopsy were done. The diagnosis of adult intussusception is difficult because the rarity of case and the nonspecific symptoms and signs. Diagnosis is made based on history, physical examination, and imaging examination, such as radiology, ultrasound, or CT scan. Plain abdominal radiology shows the obstructive signs that is present in most cases of intussusception. Ultrasound signs of intussusception include the target or doughnut sign in the transverse view and the pseudokidney, sandwich, or hayfork sign in the longitudinal view were not found in the patient at the time of diagnosis of lymphoma. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound are 98–100% and 88% consecutively, so it could rule out the presence of intussusception in this patient before the chemotherapy. Signs of intussusception on CT scan is image of bowel-within-bowel which is a picture of mesenteric fat and vessels compressed between walls of the intestines were found on the second day of admission [16,17] that was found in this patient. A review study stated that there was still controversy about the appropriate treatment modalities for primary gastrointestinal lymphomas. Some studies implied that surgical procedures according to oncological principles are sufficient, while others support the addition of chemotherapy to surgery to increase survival. In general, chemotherapy is added to surgery in cases with poor prognostic factors, such as high LDH level, T-cell phenotype, extranodal involvement of ?2, Ann Arbor stage oIII to IV, age above 60 year-old, ECOG performance status of above 1 and high positive rate of the Ki67 proliferation index immunochemically. For secondary gastrointestinal lymphomas, chemotherapy was performed first, followed by surgery in accordance to the status of intestinal involvement. The size of the surgical procedure should be determined intraoperatively in cases of intestinal obstruction requiring urgent surgery [8]. In this case, the gastrointestinal involvement of DLBCL before the initiation of chemotherapy was not clear. Intussusception occurred when the chemotherapy began to take effect. As there was axillary lymphadenopathy before chemotherapy and gastrointestinal involvement after chemotherapy, the gastrointestinal lymphoma in this case was thought to be secondary. In secondary gastrointestinal lymphoma, chemotherapy is the first line of treatment followed by surgery. There would not be any difference in the management had the gastrointestinal lymphoma had been identified before chemotherapy. Management of adult intussusception is surgical intervention [18]. Surgical intervention which is a resection of the segment of the intestine with lymphoma is recomended because it may relieves obstruction, eliminates the risk of perforation, and reduces the likelihood of hemorrhage [19]. This patient had intussusception in the ileo-colica region after chemotherapy for lymphoma, so infiltration was suspected thus resection of the involved intestine should be performed. The timing of surgical intervention in neutropenic patients is still a dilemma. A study on surgical conditions in neutropenic cancer patients found that neutrophil counts should be improved to prevent serious comorbidities and that surgery should be delayed, when possible, to allow for neutrophil to recover [20]. Other study recommended conservative, nonsurgical approach based on bowel rest, nasogastric suction, total parental nutrition and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in neutropenic enterocolitis patients without complications such as peritonitis, perforation or bleeding [21]. The patient showed no evidence of peritonitis, perforation or bleeding. On the 5th day the patient defecated, there was no nasogastric production, the abdominal distention improved, bowel movement was present and there was no blood on faeces examination. Based on these findings, surgical intervention in this patient was postponed to optimize her condition. The low neutrophil count due to the chemotherapy in this septic patient could deteriorated her condition if surgical intervention was done immediately. But her condition deteriorated before surgical intervention could be done. In conclusion, this is the first reported case of inssusception in a DLBCL patient that had undergone chemotherapy for the lymphoma. The nature of the post chemotherapy patient with sepsis presented dilemmatic situation on the management of the intussusception. "
94,S2213-0071(16)30067-3,Endobronchial involvement of mantle cell lymphoma: A case report," 2 Case report An 87-year-old man was referred to our hospital for dyspnea on exertion. He was a never smoker and had no complications. His ECOG performance status was 1. Upon physical examination, an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node was detected. A chest CT examination revealed diffuse irregular wall thickening at the trachea and bilateral bronchi (Fig. 1 ), atelectasis of the right middle lobe because of right middle bronchial wall thickening, an enlarged lymph node in the left supraclavicular and right axillary area, and splenomegaly. Complete blood counts revealed a white blood cell count of 4800/mm3, a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, a platelet count of 132,000/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count of 2822/?L (58.8%), and a lymphocyte count of 989/?L (20.6%). Moreover, large atypical lymphocytes were detected (8%). A bronchoscopy revealed diffuse irregular surface of the tracheal and bilateral bronchial mucosa and polyposis-like lesions (Fig. 2 ). An endobronchial biopsy was performed for the mucosa of trachea and the inlet of the right upper lobe and middle lobe. All biopsy specimens revealed atypical cells with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio and irregular nuclei forming sheet-like lesions. These morphologic findings were compatible with a low grade lymphoma, such as MCL (Fig. 3 A and B). On immunohistochemical staining, these atypical cells were found to be positive for CD5, CD20, CD79a, and Cyclin D1 but negative for CD3, CD10, CD21, and CD138 (Fig. 3C and D). Therefore, the diagnosis of MCL was confirmed based on the morphology and immunohistochemical findings especially positivity for CD5 and Cyclin D1. After the diagnosis of MCL, best-supportive care was selected as the treatment of choice, and he was transferred to another hospital. "
95,S1930-0433(15)30006-6,Unusual continuous intra-abdominal spread of primary testicular lymphoma along the spermatic cord and gonadal vessels: Report of 2 cases," Case report  Case 1 An 85-year-old man presented with a history of gradually increasing painless swelling in the right hemiscrotum since 4 months. He also complained of vague abdominal discomfort and intermittent pain. On examination, the scrotum was visibly enlarged with normal overlying skin. On palpation, there was a firm to hard mass in the right side of the scrotal sac measuring approximately 12 × 10 cm. It was extending superiorly into the right inguinal canal along the spermatic cord. The right testis was not palpable separately from the mass. The left testis appeared normal in size. Magnetic resonance imaging examination of abdomen and pelvis was done. On magnetic resonance imaging examination, a large heterogeneous signal intensity mass lesion was seen in scrotum arising from the right testis and completely replacing it (Figure 1 A to I ). The lesion measured approximately 7 × 7.5 × 5 cm in size. It was T1 hypointense, T2 iso-to-hypointense, short tau inversion recovery (STIR) hyperintense, and showing strong diffusion restriction. Mild homogeneous postcontrast enhancement was seen within the mass. The mass was extending along the right epididymis and right spermatic cord into the right inguinal canal and further extending into the abdomen along the right gonadal vein up to its (venous) drainage into the inferior vena cava. No significant iliac, para-aortic, or mesenteric lymph nodes were detected. Abdominal visceral organs were normal. Overall picture was suggestive of malignant neoplasm of right testis with extension along spermatic cord and right gonadal vein; diagnostic possibilities of seminoma testis and PTL were considered. The patient underwent right inguinal orchiectomy. The histopathology examination revealed diffuse large B cell lymphoma of testis. Further staging workup revealed no other deposits or lymphadenopathy. Contrast computed tomography (CT) abdomen study (part of staging workup) also confirmed homogeneous mildly enhancing soft tissue attenuation mass extending along right gonadal vein with no significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy (Figure 1 J to N). Final diagnosis was diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage IIAE. The patient was offered chemotherapy and radiotherapy.   Case 2 A 68-year-old man presented with a history of pain and redness over the right hemiscrotum since 2 months which was gradually increasing in size. Ultrasonographic examination in a local hospital revealed left inguinal hydrocele and right testicular hypoechoic lesion extending into the right spermatic cord. Possibilities of chronic orchitis and testicular neoplasm were considered. The patient was operated, and right orchiectomy with eversion of left tunica vaginalis sac was done. The histopathology examination revealed diffuse large B cell lymphoma of testis. The patient was referred to our hospital for further workup and management. Ultrasonographic scan of neck and contrast CT scan of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were done as a part of staging workup, which revealed homogeneous well-defined cordlike mass lesion along right gonadal vein extending from the right inguinal canal below to the junction of right gonadal vein and inferior vena cava superiorly. No solid visceral organ or bowel involvement was detected. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes or ascites were detected. No obvious lymphoma deposits were detected above diaphragm (Figure 2 ). Final diagnosis was diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage II. Chemotherapy with CHOP regimen (Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, Prednisolone) was planned for the patient.  "
96,S0028-3843(17)30310-9,Intraventricular treatment of secondary central nervous system lymphoma – Case study and literature overview," 2 Case presentation In March 2013, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, NOS; CD20+, CD5+/?, CD10+, BCL2+, BCL6+, MUM1?/CD43-, Ki-67++ approx. 50% of cells) at stage IV B was diagnosed in a 74-year-old man on the basis of a histological examination of a pancreas sample and the surrounding lymph nodes. A total of 8 cycles of R-CHOP immunochemotherapy was ordered. In result complete remission (CR) was obtained. At the same time, the patient was receiving a hormone therapy due to prostate cancer. In September 2015 (with CR lasting 21 months) an isolated recurrence of lymphoma in the CNS, affecting the meninges and ependyma, was discovered and radiotherapy was started. A dose of 3000cGy radiation was used on the brain and the medulla oblongata. A check-up PET examination revealed complete regression of lymphomatous lesions in the CNS and no relapse of the tumour of lymphoma in other parts of the body. After a 4-month observation, the patient's general condition deteriorated, and progressive psychomotor slowdown and memory disorders were observed. After another two months, a generalised epileptic seizure occurred. In April 2016 an MRI scan of the head showed a lymphomatous infiltration of the brain, the lateral ventricular walls, the septum pellucidum and the 3rd ventricle (Fig. 1  presents contrast enhancement of the tissue infiltrating the right lateral ventricle wall). An examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not reveal the presence of lymphomatous cells. The test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative, however the test for the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) was not performed. The patient was qualified for the Ommaya reservoir implantation to administer chemotherapy. Such a decision was made due to the patient's advanced age, general condition (ECOG-3) and numerous co-existing diseases (prostate cancer, distal pancreatic resection in case history, degenerative spine disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes). At the same time the patient did not consent to systemic chemotherapy. The treatment regimen consisted of simultaneous administration of rituximab (25mg) and methotrexate (10mg) twice a week for 4 weeks (8 doses in total). During the entire uneventful course of the intraventricular immuno-chemotherapy, steroid medications were not used, however considerable improvement in the psychomotor condition of the patient occurred. After therapy completion, an MRI check-up revealed considerable regression of changes in the CNS (Fig. 2 ). On treatment cycle end the patient was transferred to the Long-Term Care Unit. Unfortunately, he did not consent to further treatment. The documented period of the stable neurological state confirmed with CT was 7 months. Information about the later patient's medical history is not known. "
99,S1878-8750(18)30186-4,Case of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Arising at Site of Remote Herpes Encephalitis," Case Presentation An 81-year-old male was brought to the hospital by police after being stopped for erratic driving. On assessment, he was confused and disoriented, had deficits in short-term memory, and demonstrated a left superior quadrantanopsia. He was otherwise neurologically intact. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of his head revealed stable encephalomalacia of the anterior right temporal lobe from a remote episode of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. Just posterior to this was a new, extensive, T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense irregular mass measuring 4.9 × 3.1 cm (Figure 1 ) with surrounding edema, causing compression of the lateral ventricle and midline shift. The patient was started on dexamethasone and referred to neurosurgery for biopsy. A right-sided minitemporal craniotomy was performed, and a corticectomy exposed an obvious, firm tissue underneath the posteroinferior aspect of the middle temporal gyrus. Pathology demonstrated a malignant hematolymphoid neoplasm, composed of discohesive atypical cells with dark blue nuclei in an angiocentric pattern (Figure 2 ). Immunohistochemistry with CD20, a B cell marker, showed strong membranous staining, consistent with a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Tumor and normal tissue were negative for HSV antigen on immunohistochemistry. Postoperatively, he was seen in consultation by the oncology team, who determined he was not a candidate for further treatment on the basis of his poor performance status after a trial of steroids. Two months later, he developed 2 new lesions in the corpus callosum and subsequently deteriorated and ultimately passed away 6 months after the initial diagnosis. Past medical history was significant for an episode of HSV encephalitis 8 years prior. At that time, he was admitted with pneumonia, but a computed tomography scan, ordered due to concerns about headache and persisting confusion, showed edema in the anterior right temporal lobe. This was initially considered to likely represent a subacute infarct. However, the subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 hyperintensity in the entire right anterior temporal lobe and inferior right insula, with surrounding edema and areas of cortical petechial hemorrhage, more suggestive of HSV encephalitis (Figure 3 ). Cerebrospinal fluid was positive on polymerase chain reaction testing for HSV deoxyribonucleic acid and had elevated white blood cells, red blood cells, and protein, with a normal glucose level. Accordingly, the patient was treated with acyclovir for 3 weeks and recovered. Interval imaging done 4 years later for unknown reasons showed a region of encephalomalacia at the site of the previous encephalitis (Figure 4 ). "

Patients were identified from the pathology department database. The inclusion criterion was diagnosis of lymphoma initially revealed by facial sinus or nasal cavity involvement. Lymphomas that had invaded the nasal cavities or sinuses but with rhinopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or cutaneous origin were excluded, as were cases of sinus recurrence of nodal or extranodal lymphoma or sinonasal locations of other hemopathic malignancies. All patients underwent ENT consultation for exploration of one or more chronic clinical sinonasal signs. Age at diagnosis, presenting symptomatology, time from symptom onset to treatment initiation, risk factors, paraclinical assessment and treatment modalities were analyzed. All biopsies were fresh samples studied under photon microscopy to analyze tumor architecture. Immunohistochemistry determined phenotype (B or T), antibody expression (CD3, CD5, CD10, CD 20, Bcl2 and anti C-Myc) and proliferation index. Paraclinical assessment enabled staging on the Ann Arbor classification (Table 1 ). IPI (International Prognostic Index) was calculated, based on 5 factors: age (over 60 years), clinical stage (III/IV), performance index (equal to or greater than 2), LDH elevation, and involvement of 2 or more extranodal levels. Files were discussed in multidisciplinary hematology team meeting to determine the appropriate treatment strategy. Various factors were analyzed to determine their impact on survival: age, gender, Ann Arbor stage, IPI score, histologic type, sinus involvement, localized or diffuse form, and treatment implemented. Survival was calculated following Kaplan-Meier and comparisons performed on Log-rank test. "
105,S2214-4420(18)30018-4,A rare case of suspected intravascular large B-cell lymphoma forming nodular masses in the brain and around the prostate and seminal vesicle," 2 Case presentation An 80-year-old Japanese man visited our hospital showing signs of inarticulation. He had no significant past or family history of cancer. Physical examination revealed impaired walking and a positive Barré’s sign in left arm. Left hydronephrosis and mass lesions around the seminal vesicle, prostate, and retroperitoneum were found by computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 1 ). He did not have hepatomegaly nor splenomegaly. The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor value was high and there was no cytopenia during blood test (Table 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhanced by gadolinium showed two nodular masses with inflammation in the brain. Then, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the seminal vesicle and prostate was performed. There were a lot of atypical large lymphocytes. The results for CD20 and CD79 were positive, while those for CD3 and CD5 were negative. From these findings, DLBCL originating from the seminal vesicle was suspected. As his status was poor, he and his family opted for the best supportive care. Dexamethasone of 2 mg/dose was administered for edema and inflammation resulting from brain tumor. He died 23 days from hospitalization, and the autopsy was performed at our institution. Atypical lymphocyte infiltrates each organ, especially the seminal vesicle and brain. For the detection of the nature of the tumor, immunohistochemical staining was done. The results for CD20 and CD79 were positive, while those for CD3 and CD5 were negative (Fig. 2 ). There were atypical lymphocytes proliferation within the lumina of small vessels of these organs. Furthermore, there were similar findings in the mesentery, pancreas, and lymph node around the aorta. Based on the autopsy, he was diagnosed with DLBCL suspected of IVLBCL infiltrating into the prostate, bladder, lung, liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, adrenal and pituitary glands, bone marrow, kidney, mesentery, pancreas, and lymph node around the aorta with nodular mass lesions in the brain, prostate, and seminal vesicle.

The extraoral swelling was insidious in onset causing facial asymmetry with no history of trauma to the site or any history of tooth ache in the region. She gave no history of nasal congestion or watering of the eyes or any changes in the surface sensations. She presented with an intraoral swelling in the right upper back tooth region noticed around 3 months ago. The intraoral swelling was associated with dull aching type of pain localized to the region. The pain occurred on chewing food and gradually reduced with time and with over-the-counter analgesics. At the time of presentation the patient did not report any systemic symptoms and had no fever or history of weight loss. She was not on any medication, was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. The patient's previous medical, family and past dental histories were non-contributory. No abnormalities were noted on general physical examination and the TMJ examination. On local examination, a diffuse extra oral bony hard swelling involving the right zygomatic region of the face measuring approximately about 6cm×6cm was present (Fig. 1 ). It was slightly tender on malar region, and no paresthesia was noted on sensory testing. No palpable lymph nodes were present. Intraorally a diffuse swelling seen on the buccal aspect obliterating the buccal vestibule with buccal cortical plate expansion in the region of right upper canine and premolar region was seen (Fig. 2 ). The swelling was firm to hard in consistency and measured about 3cm×2cm with intact surface mucosa which appeared similar to the surrounding mucosa (Fig. 3 ). None of the teeth in the quadrant were decayed, no periodontal pockets were present in relation to teeth # 3, 4, 5 but grade I mobility was noted and the same teeth were tender on percussion. No other abnormalities were detected on hard or soft tissue examination. The clinical differential diagnosis included the fibro-osseous lesions such as ossifiying fibroma, fibrous dysplasia and the odontogenic tumors involving the maxilla. The electric pulp testing revealed that all the teeth in the upper right quadrant were vital. Intraoral oral periapical radiograph in the region of teeth # 4, 5, 6 and the right lateral occlusal radiographs showed permeative type of bone destruction in the region of teeth # 4, 5, 6, 7 with loss in the continuity of the floor of the maxillary sinus (Figs. 4 and 5  ). The panoramic radiograph showed obliteration of the right maxillary sinus with loss of continuity in the floor of the maxillary sinus and the alveolar bone in the region of teeth # 4, 5, 6 appeared dense and granular (Fig. 6 ). On computed tomography (CT), the coronal section of paranasal sinus region revealed a soft tissue lesion (48 Hounsfield Units) causing a focal destruction of floor of the right maxillary antrum and encroaching onto the alveolar process with calcifications within the lesion (Fig. 7a, b). Obliteration of maxillary sinus with destruction of the posterior and anterior walls was noted on axial sections. Malignant bone tumors presenting with permeative type of bone destruction and calcification like the osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma were considered in the radiological differential diagnosis. The incisional biopsy of the swelling was performed and the histopathology showed sheets of round and spindle shaped cells with vesiculated nuclei in a fibrous connective tissue stroma. Poorly differentiated tumor cells with increased mitotic figures and vascularity with multinucleated giant cells were seen. The features were suggestive of malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin (Fig. 8 ). Immunohistochemistry played an important role in distinguishing the cell type and differential diagnosis. In the present case the tumor cells were positive for Leucocyte common antigen (LCA/CD45), CD20 (marker that recognises the surface antigen which is expressed on B-cells), CD79a (a B-cell surface marker which can help in distinguishing form the myloid or the T-cell lines) (Fig. 9a–c), Bcl-6 (nuclear marker indicative of chromosome rearrangement required for B-cell differentiation) (Fig. 10 ) and negative for CK (Cytokeratin which is a component of the cells from the epithelial origin), vimentin (main intermediate filament protein in mesenchymal cells), CD10 (marker for follicular center B-cells and granulocytes), CD30 (marker for activated T- and B-cells), CD 138 (It is expressed on the surface of pre-B cells and plasma cells but is absent from mature B cells), CD56 (reported to express on most neuroectodermal derived cell lines, tissues, and neoplasms), Alk-1 (marker for anaplastic large cells), Melan-A (maker for melanoma antigen recognised by T cells) EMA (Epithelial membrane antigen), Mum-1 (Multiple myeloma oncogene) (Fig. 11a–j) with a Proliferative index marker Ki-67 of around 95% (Fig. 12 ) was noted. The above findings of the histochemical study indicate that the tumor cells were of large B-cell origin. Thus based on the immunologic profile a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was given. The hematological investigations revealed elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase levels and the remaining routine blood examinations were within normal limits. The patient was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To rule out metastasis a chest radiograph, the ultrasonography of the abdomen and whole body MRI was done which showed no evidence of lymphoma elsewhere. Therefore we arrived at a final diagnosis of primary intra-osseous lymphoma of the right maxilla- diffuse large B-cell type. The patient was referred to medical oncology for chemotherapy and was managed with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (hydrodoxorubicin), vincristine (oncovin) and prednisone (CHOP) regimen and is on periodic follow-up.

117,S2210-2612(17)30405-4,Perianal pseudolymphoma: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 28-year-old female presented with first episode, worsening severe perianal pain. Her symptoms developed acutely in the days prior to her presentation. She denied a history of perianal trauma, anal intercourse and high-risk activities. Relevant past medical history included a one year history of altered bowel habit with diarrhea, low dose opioid use for chronic lower back pain and current smoking status. She denied a family history of inflammatory bowel disease or other gastrointestinal disorders. The degree of perianal tenderness limited bedside examination. Examination under anaesthesia found multiple acute ulcerations of the anal verge, suggestive of Herpes Simplex. There were no abscesses, fistulae or haemorrhoids. Intra-operative biopsies demonstrated ulceration with active chronic inflammatory cells and atypical lymphoid proliferation within lymphatics. Features favoured benign intralymphatic proliferation of T-cell lymphoblasts, known commonly as pseudolymphoma. Immunohistochemistry confirmed cells limited to lymphatics. The histology result raised concerns about intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma, prompting clinical haematology-oncology review. PET imaging and gastroscopy were unremarkable. Colonoscopy demonstrated ongoing superficial ulceration of the anus. Investigations for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Helicobacter pylori, Varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, treponemal antibody, chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, full blood count, liver function tests and renal function were within normal ranges. Perianal swabs cultured streptococcus pyogenes. The patient was treated with clindamycin and acyclovir followed by cephalexin. Her symptoms subsequently resolved. Our haematology-oncology colleague felt symptoms were almost certainly a result of benign lymphoma, but would monitor the patient in following months to ensure complete resolution. "
118,S1878-8750(15)00254-5,Primary Malignant Lymphoma of the Trigeminal Nerve: Case Report and Literature Review," Case Report The patient was a 47-year-old man, suffering from Crohn disease for 2 years, with a 2-month history of progressive left facial pain and numbness. These symptoms initially developed from V3 territory and spread to all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Physical examination revealed left facial hypesthesia, left facial spasmodic prickly pain mimicking trigeminal neuralgia, diminished corneal reflex, disturbance of jaw movement, and wasting of the masseter muscle. Tumor markers including soluble interleukin-2 receptor and other laboratory studies were within the normal limits. The cell count from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 3/?L (mono: 3), and twice the cytology of CSF confirmed no malignant cells. There was no evidence of immune deficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the left trigeminal nerve at its cisternal portion, as well as at the Meckel cave, was swollen and homogeneously enhanced (Figure 1 ). Dural tail sign was not present. There was neither invasion of brainstem nor mass effect. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no evidence of bony erosion or hyperostosis. The patient underwent an operation via the lateral suboccipital approach for histopathological confirmation. Intraoperatively, the trigeminal nerve was swollen and a grayish, soft, hemorrhagic granulomatous lesion surrounding the trigeminal nerve was observed (Figure 2A ). A biopsy was taken from this lesion without injuring the trigeminal nerve. The patient was woken up immediately after surgery without new neurological deficits. Histopathological examination revealed numerous small cells with large nuclei-like lymphocytes; however, histopathological examination was eventually not able to establish a definitive diagnosis because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) did not confirm monoclonality as the specimen was not sufficiently large to make a diagnosis considering preservation of trigeminal nerve function. An inflammatory disease was suspected and close observation was undertaken. One month after surgery, the patient presented to the outpatient service with diplopia caused by left abducens nerve palsy and aggravation of left facial numbness and pain. MRI revealed enlargement of the lesion with extension to the cavernous sinus and infratemporal fossa through the foramen ovale. He underwent resection of the trigeminal lesion via the subtemporal approach based on the previous operative findings. The lesion infiltrating into the subdural space of the middle fossa was removed. The tumor had the same features as in the previous surgery and was partially removed in the Meckel cave (Figure 2). He tolerated the procedure well. The specimen was studied using H & E staining and was examined by light microscopy. The tumor was highly cellular with mitotic figures and diffusely infiltrative. Immunoperoxidase studies revealed neoplastic cells to be positive for CD20 and MUM1 and negative for CD10 and bcl-6. The Ki-67 staining index was 73%. Flow cytometric analysis of CD20 expression in the resected specimen of the patient confirmed that tumor cells were CD20 positive (Figure 3C ). Finally, histopathological examinations revealed diffuse large B cell lymphomas, nongerminal center B type (Figure 3A, B). Whole-brain radiation therapy (45 Gy) after administration of methotrexate, procarbazine, vincristine, and ranimustine (MPVR) therapy appeared to have remarkable effects. Although left facial hypesthesia and pain remained slightly, the patient's clinical course was uneventful and he did not experience recurrence over a 1-year follow-up period (Figure 4 ). "
119,S0344-0338(17)31101-9,Genomic Analysis Reveals Distinct Subtypes in Two Rare Cases of Primary Ovarian Lymphoma," 2 Case presentations  2.1 Case 1 A 15-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain and mild hypertension. Physical examination was normal and there was no superficial lymphadenopathy. The workup revealed a normal white blood cell (WBC) count with an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH:1245?U/L) and creatinine level (1.2?mg/dl). CA125 was markedly elevated at 934.8?U/ml. Other tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (?-HCG), were within normal limits. A pelvic ultrasound revealed a large echogenic lobulated mass, measuring 16.2?×?8.5?×?13.4?cm, posterior to the uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large heterogeneous mass in the pelvis extending superiorly to the lower level of the kidneys, measuring 20.4?×?14.9?×?9.4?cm. The mass was compressing both distal ureters, resulting in grade 3 bilateral hydronephrosis with an anterior displacement and distortion of the uterus. On the basis of radiologic findings, the masses were favored to be the ovarian origin and differential diagnosis of germ cell tumor such as dysgerminoma, sex-cord stromal tumor (juvenile granulosa cell tumor) was considered. Removal of the tumor with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, lymph node dissection, and bone marrow biopsy was performed. Right and left ovarian masses measured 22?×?13?×?7?cm and 16?×?11?×?6?cm, and weighed 1877.2?g and 540?g, respectively. The external surfaces of both masses were tan-white, smooth, and vaguely nodular with an intact capsule. On sectioning, both masses were tan-white, fleshy, homogenous, and vaguely nodular. There were multiple foci of necrosis, with no area of hemorrhage (Fig. 1 A & B). Histologic sections of both ovaries showed infiltration of ovarian parenchyma by diffuse sheets of atypical large lymphoid cells with moderate cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, coarse granular to vesicular chromatin, and single to multiple prominent nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies were noted. (Fig. 1C). Uninvolved ovarian parenchyma and ovarian follicles were noted in both masses. The attached bilateral fallopian tubes were not involved. Immunohistochemistry stains demonstrated that the neoplastic cells were positive for CD20 (Fig. 1D), PAX5 (strong and diffuse), BCL6 (focal) with high nuclear proliferation index (Ki67) ?90–95% (Fig. 1E). Flow cytometry revealed surface kappa clonal B cell population (?70% of total) expressing CD19 (dim), CD20 (dim) and CD22 (dim), whereas negative for CD5, CD10, and TdT (Supplemental Fig. 1). Cytogenetic studies revealed normal female karyotype. FISH studies were negative for CMYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements. There was no evidence of bone marrow involvement. The patient was admitted to another oncology center and was lost to further follow-up.   2.2 Case 2 A 5-year-old girl presented with low-grade fever, dysuria, and abdominal distention. There was no superficial lymphadenopathy. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans with contrast showed a 6?×?4?cm mass in right pelvis, ascites and multiple low-density lesions in the liver, omentum, and peritoneum. The workup revealed a normal WBC with increased LDH (?255?U/L). Tumor markers including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (?-HCG) were within normal limits. Laparoscopic biopsy of the abdominal mass and bone marrow biopsy were performed. Histologic sections of the ovary showed background oocytes (highlighted by CD117) diffusely infiltrated by atypical lymphoid cells that were large cells with round to irregular nuclei, coarsely granular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 2 A & B). The neoplastic cells showed diffuse and strong positivity for CD20 (Fig. 2C), CD43, BCL6 and weak positive staining for CD10 and BCL2 (figure not shown). CD23, TdT, EBV-LMP1, and EBER-ISH and CyclinD1 staining were negative (figure not shown). CD3 and CD5 staining showed background small T cells. The proliferative index (Ki-67) was approximate ?90% (Fig. 2D). Flow cytometry showed kappa clonal mature B-cell population (?45% of total) expressing CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD10 (dim) while negative for CD5 and TdT. (Supplemental Fig. 2). There was no evidence of bone marrow involvement. Cytogenetics revealed normal female karyotype. CMYC, BCL2, and BCL6 gene rearrangements were negative by FISH. She has been treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy and now is in complete remission.  "
120,S2090-0740(15)00030-4,Primary thyroid lymphoma: Case report and review of the literature," 2 Discussion Primary thyroid lymphoma is an uncommon pathological entity and constitutes 5% of all thyroid malignancies. It occurs in less than 3% of all non-Hodgkin’s extra-nodal lymphomas. 1  It is an uncommon condition which, to be categorized as such, must only affect the thyroid gland and, eventually, the loco-regional lymph nodes. Primary disease in other location should be ruled out. Diagnosis of PTL is complex, and surgery is often required to make a definitive diagnosis. Therapeutic management has greatly changed over time, and chemotherapy, with or with-out radiotherapy is the current treatment of choice. PTL is more commonly observed in females than in males (F/M=4/1). Most patients present in the 7th decade of life (average age e 67years), with a rapidly enlarging neck mass. 1,2  Preexisting chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis is a well-recognized risk factor predisposing to the development of PTL. 3  It has been reported that the risk of PTL among patients with autoimmune (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis is 40 times greater compared to that of the general population. It takes a long time (20–30years) to develop PTL after the onset of lymphocytic thyroiditis. 3   Normally, the thyroid gland does not contain native lymphoid tissue. Intra-thyroid lymphoid tissue develops under pathological conditions, and mainly in patients with autoimmune (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis, probably as a result of chronic antigenic stimulation. This acquired lymphoid tissue resembles mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and can evolve to non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin, which is the most common type of PTL. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and extra-nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma are its common subtypes (representing 70% and 15–30% of all primary non-Hodgkin PTLs, respectively. 4–6   A rapidly growing (usually within 1–3months), painless thyroid enlargement, either in the form of goiter or discrete nodule, is the most common clinical presentation in PTL. Pressure symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea, stridor, cough, hoarseness, superior vena cava syndrome) are often present. This clinical presentation can be confused with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma like in our case. Because of the frequent coexistence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, many patients are hypothyroid or under thyroid hormone replacement therapy. 4  Classic B-type symptoms of fever, night sweats and weight loss are less common. Clinical examination can detect diffuse or nodular thyroid enlargement. Because of the frequent coexistence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, circulating antibodies to thyroid peroxidase are positive in a large percentage of patients (60%). 7   Imaging studies (ultrasonography, computed tomography) reveal a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland (resembling goiter) or a nodular thyroid gland (solitary or multiple thyroid nodules, commonly cold), mimicking thyroiditis or a primary thyroid follicular lesion. Nowadays, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is an essential tool in the management of thyroid diseases. However, FNA has yielded inconsistent results in the diagnosis of PTL. Rates of achieving a positive diagnosis range widely, in the literature, from 25% up to 90%. 7,8  PTL should be strongly considered when the aspirated specimen predominantly consists of lymphocytes. PTL should be differentiated from lymphomas at other sites. This is especially important given the rarity of PTL. In this case, lymphoma of the thyroid gland could be the result of secondary involvement of the gland by the tumor. Moreover, PTL should be differentiated from Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and from poorly differentiated, undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Adjunctive techniques (immuno-histo-chemistry, flow cytometry, etc.) are of particular importance in differentiating PTL from anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; this is an important consideration given that management and prognosis of these two diseases is totally different. The role of surgery in the management of PTL remains highly controversial. There are reports in the literature supporting the role of surgery in the management of selected patients with PTL. Surgery alone has been proposed for the management of localized (stage IE, ANN ARBOR Classification) intra-thyroidal lymphoma. 9–12  When there is any question of incomplete surgical resection, adjuvant external beam radiation therapy should be considered postoperatively. Like surgery, external beam radiation therapy alone has been proposed for the management of localized (stage IE) lymphoma. There is evidence that radiation therapy can achieve local control of the disease. The radiation field includes the neck plus the upper mediastinum and the treatment dose is moderate (30–50Gy). 13   Chemotherapy can control distant dissemination of the disease, while radiation therapy can achieve local control of the lymphoma. The conventional chemotherapeutic regimen for PTL includes cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP). Typically, patients with PTL respond rapidly to this regimen. Systemic chemotherapy is usually associated with the typical radiation therapy (chemo-radiation therapy). Most commonly, radiation therapy is used after 3–6 courses of chemotherapy. 10,12  Combined chemo-radiation therapy is associated with a significantly lower risk of distant failure. Rituximab has recently been effectively used (with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine, and prednisolone) in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of thyroid. 14   The prognosis of patients depends on the histological grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease. MALT lymphomas tend to have a more indolent course and a better prognosis compared with patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or mixed histological subtypes, which have a more aggressive clinical course. Patients with MALT lymphoma had significantly higher complete response rates than those with DLBCL both for early as well as for advanced disease. Overall, 5-year survival ranges between 50 and 60%. 2,15,16   "
121,S2212-5558(14)00165-3,Spontaneous complete remission of methotrexate-associated extranodal B-cell lymphoma of the buccal mucosa: Review of the literature and report of a case," 2 Case report A 71-year-old man was referred to our outpatient clinic for evaluation of a painful, indurated necrotic mass 36mm×27mm in the right buccal mucosa that had persisted for approximately 2 months (Fig. 1A). Examination revealed the presence of a necrotic ulceration in the buccal mucosa, and submandibular lymphadenopathy was obvious bilaterally. A clinical diagnosis of oral cancer with bilateral regional lymph nodes metastases was made. The patient also noticed a subcutaneous mass 50mm×37mm in the right axilla that had gradually increased in size over a period of approximately 2 years, and reported discomfort from pus discharging in the left knee due to postoperative infection 6 years after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). RA had been diagnosed 16 years previously and treated with prednisolone (5mg/day), as well as MTX (12mg/week) for 7 years. After consulting with his family doctor, MTX treatment was discontinued because the RA appeared to be in remission. His past medical history also revealed that he had been prescribed sodium risedronate hydrate for osteoporosis, furosemide and amlodipine besylate for hypertension, and alogliptin benzoate for type II diabetes mellitus. Results of laboratory examination were within normal limits, except for C-reactive protein (CRP) at 6.34mg/dL (normal range, 0–0.3mg/dL) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor at 1662U/mL (range, 124–466U/mL). Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) revealed foci of uptake in the right buccal mucosa, bilateral sublingual lymph nodes, right axilla, right lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, sacrum and hip bone (Fig. 2 A and B). Incisional biopsy of the tumor in the buccal mucosa was performed, and histopathological examination showed diffuse infiltrated abundant lymphoblastic tumor cells compatible with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Fig. 3A). Additional immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the atypical cells as positive for CD20 and CD79a and negatively stained for cytokeratin and CD5 (Fig. 3B and C). In situ hybridization demonstrated positive results for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) (Fig. 4 ). These histological and immunohistochemical findings resulted in a diagnosis of DLBCL. The patient was referred for evaluation of staging and treatment by a medical oncologist. Findings of bone marrow examination were unremarkable macroscopically and cytologically, with no evidence of lymphomatous involvement. Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of stage I non-Hodgkin lymphoma was made. Within 2 weeks after discontinuing MTX, the intraoral lesion had started to reduce in size. Punch biopsy of the tumorous enlargement in the axilla was performed by a dermatologist and apocrine adenocarcinoma of the skin was diagnosed. Further transbronchial lung biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumor excision and concomitant lymphadenectomy of the right axilla was carried out. Before starting chemotherapy, the patient removed his TKA prosthesis for anti-inflammatory purposes, but 2 months after withdrawal of MTX, the tumor of the buccal mucosa and bilateral lymphadenopathy had disappeared. As of the time of writing, more than 12 months later, no relapse of the ulcerated tumor or cervical lymphadenopathy has been noted. The RA is being controlled with corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Apocrine-derived adenocarcinoma dissemination has also regressed, but persists despite intermittent denosumab chemotherapy. "
122,S1876-0341(15)00006-4,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a patient with lymphoma treated with rituximab: A case report and literature review," Case presentation The patient was a 55-year-old man who first presented with a complaint of cough, fever, and a 4-kg weight loss over eight months’ duration. Physical examination was significant for right axillary lymphadenopathy. A CT scan showed hepatic and splenic lesions and multiple abdominal lymphadenopathies. The patient underwent bone marrow and right axillary lymph node biopsies. The pathology showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with bone marrow involvement (stage IV-B). He received R-CHOP. The patient had significant clinical improvement on R-CHOP but developed prolonged neutropenia which required several hospital admissions, despite the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors. Following additional review, the pathological diagnosis was revised to nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma; however, the patient was continued on the same regimen. After four cycles of R-CHOP, he had excellent clinical and radiological response to the treatment. The fifth cycle was delayed, as the patient did not appear for the therapy until the following month, when the treatment was resumed. After completing six cycles, a positron emission tomography (PET)-scan showed several small lymph nodes in the mediastinum and in the lung hilar areas with very low Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) of 2.1 of unknown significance. A month later, he was admitted with seizure activity. A CT scan of the brain followed by an MRI showed multiple brain lesions (Figs. 1 and 2  ). The MRI of the brain showed multifocal cortical and subcortical periventricular lesions with no edema and enhancement. A similar lesion was noted in the brainstem. He was initially started on anti-bacterial and anti-fungal treatment. A brain biopsy was performed with a pathological diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Fig. 3 ). During his stay, he became unresponsive and bedridden. He had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion. Mefloquine was not used due to G6PD deficiency.  Histopathology of the Brian Biopsy The biopsy was composed of white matter which showed dense macrophage infiltration associated with myelin loss. The presence of demyelination was confirmed by the stains for LFB/PAS and neurofilament, which highlight the loss of myelin with relative axonal preservation, as is typical of demyelination. In the background, there was evidence of bizarre astrocytes with large hyperchromatic nuclei, as well as more typical viral inclusions characterized by chromatin margination. These inclusions were well-highlighted by the in-situ hybridization studies for John Cunningham (JC) virus. On CD3 and CD20 stains, a moderate number of CD3 positive T-lymphocytes were present.  "

Orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent retrobulbar mass involving apical region in the right orbit (Fig. 1B and C). Orbitotomy was performed and the histologic features of inferior orbital tissue demonstrated high-grade extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Neither laboratory analysis nor image study showed evidence of systemic involvement (Stage IE). After discussion with hematologists, a combination regimen of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) was applied. His symptoms improved significantly without complications in the following 5 years (Fig. 1D).   2.2 Case 2 A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to right eyelid swelling and drooping for 1 month. Ophthalmological examination revealed excellent visual acuity (6/6 in both eyes); the anterior segment and fundi showed normal appearance. However, a mass measuring 1.5 cm × 1.0 cm was palpable in the right upper lid (Fig. 2 A). Right lacrimal gland tumor was noted from head and neck computed tomography (CT; Fig. 2B). Based on the CT scan finding, excisional biopsy was performed, and the pathology revealed low-grade, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The hematologist suggested observation and follow-up. However, recurrent lid swelling with proptosis was noted 6 months later. Recurrent lymphoma with involvement of the right lacrimal gland (Fig. 2C), right parotid gland, pretracheal region, cervical, and mediastinal nodes were found on CT scan (Stage II E). Since this was a low-grade lymphoma, debulking of lacrimal gland tumor through right anterior orbitotomy was performed. The patient also underwent adjuvant radiotherapy to the residual tumor with 36 Gy in 18 fractions. There was no local recurrence in the following 6 months, and systemic chemotherapy will be considered if high-grade transformation of lymphoma occurs.   2.3 Case 3 A 62-year-old woman noted left lower lid palpable mass for 6 months (Fig. 3 ). She denied systemic disease or trauma history. The ocular examinations showed normal anterior segment and fundi. The result of excisional biopsy demonstrated low-grade, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT. Laboratory data showed normal blood profile, liver panel, and renal function. CT of head, neck, and whole abdomen showed no evidence of systemic lymphoma (Stage IE). The postoperative condition was stable without tumor recurrence in the following 6 months.   2.4 Cases 4 and 5 Two 45-year-old female patients presented with orange–red, painless, and progressively enlarging masses over nasal bulbar conjunctiva of the left eyes (Fig. 4 A). The past medical history was uneventful and particularly no B-symptoms were reported. The ocular examinations were normal except for the conjunctival masses. Both patients underwent excisional biopsy and the histology also showed low-grade, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT. Neither laboratory survey nor image study showed evidence of systemic involvement (stage IE). The conjunctival wounds healed well without tumor recurrence after 1-year follow up postoperatively (Fig. 4B).  "

In addition, other common locations include the extranasal skin (in 40% of cases), palate, soft tissue, gastrointestinal tract, and gonads [3]. Natural killer-cell /T-cell lymphoma of the “nasal” type is associated with lesional integration of nucleic acid from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in greater than 95% of cases.

125,S2212-5558(15)00065-4,Mantle cell lymphoma presenting as a symmetrically hard palatal swelling: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case report A 92-year-old Japanese man was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of our hospital because of a painless swelling in the hard palate. He had first become aware of swelling 6 months previously, as it had caused instability of his maxillary denture, and subsequently showed slow growth thereafter. On examination, the hard palate showed a normal coloration and no ulceration, but was symmetrically swollen (Fig. 1 ). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a palatine tumor (Fig. 2 A and B) and osteolysis with a “moth-eaten” appearance (Fig. 2B). Although cervical lymphadenopathy was noted (Fig. 3 ), generalized lymphadenopathy was not evident. The results of blood tests were all within the normal ranges, except for the level of soluble interleukin-2 (sIL-2) receptor (1559U/ml). Both the patient and his family had an unremarkable medical history. The clinical diagnosis was a suspected lymphoma in view of the markedly increased level of the sIL-2 receptor, and biopsy of the palatine tumor and a cervical lymph node was performed. The biopsy sample from the palatine tumor disclosed diffuse infiltrates of small to intermediate-sized lymphoid cells underneath the oral mucosal epithelium (Fig. 4 A–C). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the lymphoid cells were positive for CD5 (Fig. 5 A), CD20 (Fig. 5B), CD79a, bcl-2, cyclin D1 (Fig. 5C) and CD43 (Fig. 5D: weakly or strongly positive), ki-67 (MIB-1 index, 68.5%), and were negative for CD3, CD10, CD21, CD23, bcl-6, TdT and EBV-latent infection membrane protein-1. In situ hybridization also showed negativity for EBV-encoded small RNA. The lymph node biopsy sample revealed similar findings (data not shown). On the basis of these data, MCL of the hard palate seemed the most likely diagnosis. The patient was transferred to the hematology department of a local medical center, where the diagnosis of MCL was confirmed by additional examination (not including chromosomal analysis). In view of the patient's advanced age, chemotherapy was not administered, and he received only prednisolone. Thereafter, the size of the tumor mass decreased markedly, and the patient had a good clinical course. However, at the family's request, any further treatment was discontinued due to progression of the patient's pre-existing dementia. The case study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Meikai University School of Dentistry (A0832).   2.2 Immunohistochemistry Deparaffinized sections were immersed in absolute methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 15min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing, the sections were immersed in 0.01M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and heated in a microwave oven for 5min at high voltage and then for 10min at low voltage. They were then incubated with appropriately diluted anti-human antibodies listed in Table 2 . After washing, the sections were incubated with a pre-diluted anti-mouse or rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) for 30min at room temperature. They were then immersed for 8min in 0.05% 3,3?-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) in 0.05M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.01% H2O2, and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 90s.   2.3  In situ hybridization  In situ hybridization (ISH) with EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) oligonucleotides was performed to test for the presence of EBV small RNA in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using a hybridization kit (Dako, A/S, Denmark) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

126,S0046-8177(15)00088-X,Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia associated with primary lymphoma in the urinary bladder: a case report," 2 Case presentation  2.1 Clinical features An 81-year-old white man, with no previous history of bladder neoplasms, presented with macroscopic hematuria and pain on micturition. He had a computed tomography scan that showed a 5.0 × 3.0-cm solitary mass lesion situated from the anterior wall to the right lateral bladder wall (Fig. 1 ). He had a cystoscopy that revealed a wide-based mass, and biopsied specimens of the mass were examined histologically. In particular, the patient had an initial small superficial biopsy followed by 2 transurethral resections of the bladder (TURB).   2.2 Histologic features and immunohistochemical findings The lesion, as described in the initial biopsy, consisted of nests of urothelial cells separated by a diffuse and dense lymphocytic infiltrate (Fig. 2A). The referring pathologist considered the urothelial nests as malignant because of their location in the subepithelial connective tissue, that is, nested variant of UC, and interpreted the lymphocytic infiltrate as reactive. No immunohistochemical investigation was conducted. However, the message that was conveyed to the treating physician was one of uncertainty about the final diagnosis, thus suggesting a further transurethral resection of the bladder lesion. The additional material (ie, first TURB) was examined histologically by 1 of our team (R.M.) together with the slides of the previous histology. While confirming the dual component of the lesion, the consulting pathologist noted that the stromal lymphocytic infiltrate represented the main component. The lymphocytic elements were also noted within the epithelial nests, including the surface urothelium, which was focally hyperplastic as well as in the muscularis propria. The lymphocytic infiltrate, organized in nodules (Fig. 2B and C), looked monotonous and composed by medium-sized cells and scattered mononuclear larger cells with an inconspicuous nucleolus. The lymphoid cells colonized some reactive germinal centers. Immunohistochemistry showed that the epithelial component was p53 and CK20 negative, the proliferation activity, assessed with Ki-67, being below 1%. The lymphoid cells were predominantly reactive for B-cell markers (CD20) (Fig. 2D), whereas T cells expressing CD3 were a minority. No coexpression of CD5, CD23, Bcl-6, and CD10 was found in the B cells. Because the immunohistochemical results were conclusive for B-cell lymphoma, molecular studies for clonal rearrangement of IgH gene were not performed. The cells were not actively proliferating, the Ki-67–positive index being low (5%). Given the morphophenotypic features, the lymphoid infiltrate was interpreted as an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. According to the 2008 World Health Organization classification, it was interpreted as extranodal marginal-type lymphoma [10]. Although the epithelial nests superficially looked like the nested variant of UC, they lacked the typical features of such neoplasm, in particular, the somewhat disordered, confluent, anastomosing urothelial nests. The base of nested UCs in well-oriented sections is generally irregular with an infiltrative edge compared with the linear, demarcated base seen in our case. Although nested UCs are generally cytologically bland, some subtle cytologic atypia is often present; this atypia is often more pronounced toward the base of the carcinoma, that is, a feature that was not appreciated in our cytologically bland case. Finally, nested UCs are deeply invasive, with urothelial nests within the muscularis propria, whereas in our case, the nests were mostly located in the most superficial part of the subepithelial connective tissue. Based on all this, the epithelial component was interpreted as pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the urothelium. The second TURB revealed a deep-sited lymphoma with no epithelial abnormalities.   2.3 Clinical follow-up The patient was submitted to an accurate clinical and imaging (computed tomography of the pelvis, chest x-ray, and gallium scintigraphy) workup for staging, including a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy. No evidence of lymphoma was found elsewhere, and the disease was interpreted as primary in the bladder. The patient had stage I (AE) lymphoma. Because of the age of the patient and presence of comorbidities, the treating physician opted for a wait-and-see follow-up. The patient, seen for the first time 2 years ago, has not shown clinical evidence of local and systemic disease progression.  "
128,S1027-8117(17)30084-8,Cutaneous lymphomas in Taiwan: A review of 118 cases from a medical center in southern Taiwan," Patients and methods Cases with the first pathology diagnosis of lymphoma, mycosis fungoides and pseudolymphoma during January 2001 and December 2010 were retrieved from the database system of the Department of Dermatology. In our routine practice, the diagnostically challenging cases were evaluated by both dermatopathologist (JYYL) and hematopathologist (KCC) to reach a final diagnosis. For the present study, we reviewed clinical, laboratory data and pathology slides, including patient's age, gender, age of onset, and clinical features, course and outcome of individual cases. Primary CLs were defined as lymphoma presenting in the skin without evidence of extracutaneous involvement except regional lymph node at the time of diagnosis. 3  Conversely, the diagnosis was secondary cutaneous lymphoma if there is evidence of extracutaneous involvement except regional lymph node at the time of diagnosis. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of National Cheng Kung University (No: B-ER-104-066). We performed immunohistochemical staining for various markers as needed to reach a final diagnosis, including antibodies against CD3, CD8, CD30, Bcl-6, TdT, ALK, Ki-67, ?/? light chain and MUM-1 (these antibodies from Dako); CD4, CD7 and CD56 (Ventana); CD5 (Cell Marque); CD10 (Novocastra); Bcl-2 (BioGenex); PD-1 (Zeta Corporation); TCR-? (BOND-MAX) and granzyme B, ?F-1 (8A3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In-situ hybridization studies were performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-derived digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe on cases suspicious of SPTCL and ENKL to detect Epstein–Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER). The presence of type I human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) was checked using a particle agglutination assay (PA Serodia-HTLV-1, Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for antibodies to viral antigen in T cell lymphoma. 8  We also performed additional PCR studies for T-cell receptor (TCR) genes or immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in cases as indicated to reach the diagnosis. 10   The final diagnosis of lymphomas was made according to the 2008 WHO classification of Hematopoietic and lymphoid Tumors 5  and its 2016 update, and after correlating the clinical and pathologic findings. For diagnostically challenging cases of early lesions of MF, we adopted the 4 points criteria for diagnosis of early MF based on integration of clinical, histopathologic, immunopathologic, and molecular biological characteristics as proposed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma (ISCL). 11   Briefly, the ISCL criteria consist of (1) Clinical (maximum 2 points): persistent and/or progressive patches/thin plaques plus two of the additional features (non-sun exposed location, size/shape variation, poikiloderma); (2) Histopathologic (maximum 2 points): superficial lymphoid infiltrate plus two of the additional features (epidermotropism without spongiosis, lymphoid atypia with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei and irregular or cerebriform nuclear contours); (3) Molecular biological: one point for clonal TCR gene rearrangement; (4) Immunopathologic: one point for reduced or loss of expression of CD2, CD3, CD5 (<50%) or CD7 (<10%) of T cells or epidermal/dermal discordance of these markers. The variants of MF, including folliculotropic MF, pagetoid reticulosis and granulomatous slack skin, and other clinical manifestations of MF, such as erythrodermic, large cell transformation or hypopigmented MF, were also specified. The staging of lymphomas was based on the new tumor-node-metastasis-blood (TNMB) classification proposed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the cutaneous lymphoma task force of the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). 12   The responses to treatment were defined as follows: complete response (CR) means complete resolution of skin lesions, partial response (PR) >50% reduction of baseline skin lesions; stable disease, <50% clearance of baseline skin lesions to < 25% growth of tumor; progression, >25% growth of tumor or development of new tumors. Recurrence was defined as patients who achieved CR but then progressed. All statistical analysis was done using Prism version 5.02 (GraphPad software). Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Alpha was set at 0.05 in two-sided comparisons. "
130,S2210-5336(15)00144-6,Primary central nervous system lymphoma as a cause of hemichorea in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: A case report and a review of the literature," Case report We report the case of a 24-year old patient with an 8-month history of HIV who was treated with efavirenz, tenofovir and emtricitabina. He was admitted to our institute complaining of progressive uncontrollable involuntary movements of his right arm and leg that had developed over the previous two weeks. The involuntary movements had become more severe as the days passed and he had trouble performing his basic daily activities. There was no history of drug abuse. On neurological examination he had non-patterned involuntary movements of right arm and leg predominantly distal with a proximal component that was consistent with hemichorea. The intensity was severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living. He was also found inattentive and there was no evidence of dystonic features such as patterned movements or sensory tricks. There were no proprioceptive disturbances. At physical examination, he was found to have anal warts. Brain MRI showed hyper-intense lesions on FLAIR and T2 sequences with discrete uptake of contrast media in the ipsilateral lenticular and caudate nucleus, with mass effect and peritumoral edema also including the ipsilateral thalamus (Figs. 1 and 2  ). There was also less involvement of contralateral basal ganglia, cerebral peduncles and corpus callosum. Lesions had restricted diffusion, predominantly, the right caudate nucleus, apparent diffusion coefficient showed low values (Figs. 3 and 4  ). Neuroimaging findings failed to show images consistent with leptomeningeal metastases including leptomeningeal, subependymal, dural or cranial nerve enhancement. A blood test showed: Hemoglobin 12.6, mean corpuscular volume 86.6, hematocrit 36.1, erythrocytes 4.40 leukocytes 3.38, lymphocytes 37.9%, monocytes 6.2%, neutrophils 53.8%, eosinophils 1.5%, platelets 244. Liver function tests: Alkaline phosphatase 127.74, total Bilirubin 0.25, aspartate aminotransferase 15.05, alanine aminotransferase 9.30, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase 66.42. Elisa for HIV was reactive and Western Blot positive. The blood viral load was <40, CD4 367 and the CSF viral load was undetectable. Previous to hospitalization viral load was 52, CD4 261, CD8 1209 and previous to antiretroviral treatment viral load was 367514 and CD4 238. CSF PCR was negative for herpes, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, enterovirus, Toxoplasma, parvovirus, and the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Physical examination and thoracic and abdominal computed tomography with contrast media failed to show the presence of adenopathies, visceromegaly or evidence of neoplasia. A positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodesoxiglucose only showed a hypermetabolic lesion in right cerebral hemisphere. Empirical treatment was started against toxoplasmosis following a protocol for patients with HIV with intracranial space-occupying lesions. He received oral pyrimethamine 25mg every 24h, clindamycin 600mg every 8h and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole 160mg/800mg every 12h. Once completing two and half weeks of treatment, new imaging studies showed increased lesion volume and uptake of contrast media consistent with treatment failure. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology was negative for neoplastic cells and a biopsy was performed. The immunohistochemistry was positive for CD 20 and a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma was made. However he developed severe pneumonia and died. The postmortem histopathological study of the lesion showed neoplasia with a diffuse pattern with blood vessel and brain parenchymal involvement (Fig. 5 ). Immunohistochemistry with CD45 and CD20 for neoplastic lymphocytes was positive and it was concluded that a Type B Primary central nervous system lymphoma was present. "
135,S1092-9134(17)30296-4,Hodgkin lymphoma with an interfollicular growth pattern: A clinicopathologic study of 8 cases," 2 Materials and methods We used a computer-based search to retrieve all of the cases of CHLs that were diagnosed in our institution over the past 10years from 2008 through 2017. We reviewed the microscopic descriptions, final diagnoses and comments from all the pathology reports. We selected cases with the diagnosis of CHL in excised lymph nodes with an interfollicular growth pattern or morphologic features suggestive of paracortical, early involvement or focal growth patterns. We also searched for reports describing RS cells, Hodgkin cells or atypical immunoblastic lymphoid cells in interfollicular or paracortical regions. We retrieved the available archived hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides and the immunohistochemical slides of these cases. We reviewed the slides to confirm the presence of typical RS cells or their Hodgkin cell variants with the appropriate immunoprofiles. In addition, for the well-documented cases of CHL, we searched for any previous lymph node biopsies that were initially diagnosed or described as benign, reactive, negative, and follicular or paracortical hyperplasia. We reviewed the H&E slides of these previous lymph nodes to identify any missed initial diagnosis of CHL with IF involvement. We have included cases of HL with IF involvement that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of typical RS cells that were positive for CD15 and CD30 and negative for LCA with or without positivity for CD20, EMA and EBV. We have excluded cases that showed atypical large immunoblastic lymphoid cells that were CD15 negative and LCA (CD45RB) positive. We have also excluded cases that showed an effaced nodal architecture, a prominent focal nodule or mass formation of easily recognizable foci of HL and lymph nodes that did not show reactive follicular hyperplasia. We categorized the cases according to the pattern of the nodal architecture, pattern and extent of IF involvement, number of RS cells and the background in the involved IF areas. We looked for any associated lesions or other morphologic variants. We reviewed the IHC slides for each case and categorized the immunoprofile of the RS cells. We studied the following available markers: CD45RB (LCA), CD20, CD79a, ALK, CD3, CD30, CD15, EMA (Epithelial Membrane Antigen) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) using EBER and EBV-LMP1. We collected the relevant clinical, radiologic and serologic features for each patient. They included the age, gender, initial clinical presentations, levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the site of the excised lymph node, radiologically involved lymph nodes, the stage of the disease, the received treatment; follow up, history of recurrence and survival data. We have tabulated the cases serially according to their chronological order. "
139,S0039-6257(14)00257-4,Optic nerve lymphoma: Report of two cases and review of the literature," 2 Case reports  2.1 Case 1 A 65-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain in June 2011; this led to the diagnosis of abdominal follicular B-cell NHL by retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy. At that time a bone marrow biopsy showed normal cellular marrow with several lymphoid aggregates, but the sample was not diagnostic for lymphoma. Additionally, flow cytometry did not show any abnormal lymphoid population. She was in clinical remission after receiving six cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab ending in June 2012. One month after completing chemotherapy, she developed symptoms of a sinus infection, including right-sided injection, pain, and irritation, as well as blurry vision in her right eye. She was being treated with a second course of antibiotics for presumed sinus infection on referral to ophthalmology. She had no previous ophthalmic history. On initial examination, she had a visual acuity of count fingers at 2 feet in the right eye and a right relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). Slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment was normal, with the exception of swelling of her right upper and lower eyelids. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye showed optic disk edema, vascular engorgement, an ischemic macula, and scattered intra-retinal hemorrhages (Fig. 1 A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without gadolinium of the orbits showed findings consistent with a right optic neuritis including moderately intense enhancement of the right optic nerve sheath, and right optic nerve and sheath swelling to approximately 7 mm; for comparison, the left optic nerve measured approximately 3 mm (Fig. 1B). A lumbar puncture yielded cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) negative for malignant cells, bacteria, and fungi. A systemic infectious disease evaluation was negative. A bone marrow biopsy and did not show any evidence of lymphoma. She subsequently progressed to no light perception right eye, and an optic nerve biopsy was recommended as the patient had no evidence of lymphomatous involvement elsewhere. She underwent a medial anterior orbitotomy with incisional biopsy of the optic nerve sheath. Examination of the biopsy specimen showed that the nerve fiber bundles were largely necrotic, and only myelin remained. The fibrovascular pial septa were distended with mononuclear cells, including primarily small, round lymphocytes and occasional larger lymphocytes. Tumor cells were present in both the nerve tissue as well as the nerve sheath and pial septa, and there was no apparent follicular architecture (Fig. 1C–E). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD45 and CD20 in many lymphocytes (Fig. 1F), CD10 in scattered lymphocytes with no discernible follicular architecture, and negative for CD3. Flow cytometry was precluded due to a low cell count. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed a clonal IgH Kappa gene rearrangement and was negative for T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. After biopsy confirmation of lymphoma, the patient underwent re-staging of her NHL, which included computed tomography (CT) of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as an MRI brain scan that did not show any other areas of metastasis. One month post biopsy, the patient was undergoing radiation therapy to the right optic nerve, remained no light perception (NLP) in the right eye, and intrathecal chemotherapy was being considered.   2.2 Case 2 A 25-year-old Hispanic woman initially presented in February 2012 with weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and increasing abdominal girth. MRI showed an ovarian mass with mild hydronephrosis and a thickened and dilated small bowel. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophrectomy in March 2012 and pathologic evaluation was consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed hypermetabolic activity in multiple organs including the thyroid gland, breasts, right atrium, left ventricle, kidneys, small bowel, periportal and aortocaval lymph nodes, and multiple bones, suggesting widespread involvement of the lymphoma. She promptly began R-HCVAD (rituximab-cyclphosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone, doxorubicin) combination systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy for stage 4 Burkitt lymphoma. A follow-up PET scan in June 2012, showed near resolution of hypermetabolic activity, and a repeat PET scan indicated complete response to therapy. She was admitted to the oncology service in August, 2012, for her scheduled seventh of eight rounds of chemotherapy and reported decreasing vision in her left eye. Initial ophthalmic evaluation showed 20/200 acuity left eye, no RAPD, and 1 of 14 color plates in her left eye, while her right eye examination was normal. A dilated fundus examination showed no disk edema and retinal pigmentary changes in both eyes. Follow-up examination 18 days later showed in her left eye NLP vision, a RAPD, a possible ophthalmic artery occlusion, and the optic nerve appeared edematous and infiltrated (Fig. 2 A). She underwent a lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsy, both of which were negative for malignant cells. An MRI of the brain and orbits with and without gadolinium showed an abnormal T2 signal and enhancement of the left optic nerve with a soft tissue infiltrate most prominent along the intraorbital left optic nerve and filling the left retrobulbar space (Fig. 2B). A left frontal orbitotomy with biopsy of the lacrimal gland was attempted, as the tissue was more accessible; pathologic examination was negative for malignancy. Because the patient was otherwise considered to be in clinical remission and the biopsy was negative, she underwent a left anterior medial orbitotomy with biopsy of the left optic nerve and optic nerve sheath. The biopsy specimen showed that the fibrovascular septa of the optic nerve were infiltrated with lymphocytes and occasional histiocytes (Fig. 2C). There was no clear evidence of a starry sky pattern as there was a significant amount of crush artifact (Fig. 2C–E). Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated diffuse positivity for CD20 (Fig. 2F), scattered positivity for histiocytic marker CD68, and were negative for CD3 and CD5. Flow cytometry was precluded due to a low cell count. PCR showed a clonal IgH Kappa gene rearrangement and was negative for T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. On re-staging PET scan and MRI imaging, she was found to have trigeminal nerve involvement and progression along the left optic nerve extending to the optic tracts representing perineural spread of the tumor. The patient began whole brain radiation for multifocal CNS involvement of Burkitt lymphoma. Approximately 2 months after presentation with visual symptoms, she was admitted for neutropenic fever, slowly declined, and transitioned to hospice care.  "
142,S1930-0433(18)30458-8,Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma presenting with diffusely increased pulmonary fluorodeoxyglucose uptake without corresponding CT abnormality," Discussion  Etiology and demographics IV-LBCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, usually B-cell immunophenotype, characterized by preferential growth of malignant lymphocytes within the lumina of small vessels, aggressive behavior, and often fatal course [1]. IV-LBCL usually affects elderly patients with median age at diagnosis in the sixth-seventh decades.   Clinical and imaging findings Patients with IV-LBCL may present with poor performance status, elevated lactic dehydrogenase serum levels, anemia, and B symptoms ( Table 1  ) [1,2]. In contrast to other types of lymphoma, the bone marrow, lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and cerebrospinal fluid are often uninvolved in IV-LBCL. Clinical presentation is highly variable with the most pronounced differences related to the geographical origin of the patient, although it often includes organ dysfunction related to obstruction of blood vessels. Fever, skin lesions, and rapidly progressive neurologic symptoms are more common in Western countries, while bone marrow, spleen, and liver involvement are more common in Asia [1,3,4]. central nervous system (CNS) involvement may present similar to an ischemic stroke. Pulmonary artery involvement results in dyspnea and hypoxemia, presenting similar to a pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension [5–7]. Filling defects are usually not identified on computed tomography angiogram [5,8,9]. This is presumably due to lymphomatous cells being primarily located in small peripheral pulmonary arteries and capillary beds. Five case reports of isolated pulmonary artery involvement presenting with diffuse or regional increased pulmonary FDG uptake and normal appearance on CT have been published [10–14]. In 1 study, gallium scintigraphy demonstrated similar increased pulmonary uptake although was less pronounced than FDG uptake [14].   Diagnosis Biopsy is generally required to make the diagnosis since the malignant cells are located within the lumina of small vessels, with percutaneous, transbronchial, and excisional lung biopsies reported in confirmed cases. Multiple cases have reported, successfully confirming the diagnosis by random skin or subcutaneous biopsy, demonstrating proliferating lymphoma cells within the lumina of vessels [11,15,16]. B-cell origin is the most common immunophenotype. Immunohistochemistry in almost all cases of IV-LBCL stains positive for surface antigen CD-20, with CD-5 and CD-10 being the next most common [17]. CD-29 and CD-54, surface antigens involved in transvascular migration into organs or lymph nodes, are consistently absent in IV-LBCL, which explains the preferential intravascular growth [18].   Differential diagnosis Diffusely increased pulmonary FDG uptake has also been reported in cases of inflammatory and infectious pneumonitis, pulmonary contusion, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in which CT findings were initially absent or disproportionately less than FDG-PET findings. In each of these cases, CT findings progressed over 3-5 days with development of ground glass opacities or consolidation corresponding to the areas of increased uptake ( Table 2  ) [19–21].   Treatment and prognosis Nonspecific, variable clinical presentation, and occult radiologic features, including absence of significant lymphadenopathy often results in diagnostic delay, which in combination with its aggressive behavior, result poor prognosis for IV-LBCL [22]. In fact, diagnosis at autopsy is not uncommon [23,24]. Prognosis was extremely poor prior to the advent of rituximab [25], although, it is now considered that detection and treatment at an early stage can improve survival [25,26]. In 1 case report of isolated pulmonary involvement by IV-LBCL, diagnosed by PET-CT, complete remission was achieved for over 24 months, supporting the role of PET-CT in early diagnosis [14]. Current standard of treatment is rituximab plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which has been shown to be superior to chemotherapy alone. The largest retrospective study demonstrated complete response in 82%, 2-year overall survival in 66%, and 2-year progression-free survival in 56% of patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy plus rituximab [25].

The assessment using the APACHE II scale proved to be 15 points with 25% mortality. A simple abdomen tomography was taken, showing left pleura thickening with a small effusion, abdomen with free fluid in all the abdominal cavity, and stomach with thickened walls where the left lobe of the liver adhered to the stomach (Fig. 1 ). An emergency laparotomy was performed, where 600cc of inflammatory free fluid was found in the cavity, with no data of active bleeding; a mass involving the liver, stomach and colon; absence of anterior gastric wall found upon dissection; from 3cm below the oesophagogastric junction up to the pylorus, the folds of the gastric mucosa were thickened and indurated; inflammatory adenopathies in the greater and lesser curvature of approximately 0.5cm; and transverse colon dilated approximately 5cm of diameter (Fig. 2 ). With these findings, it is decided to perform a full gastrectomy with oesophagostoma plus placing of jejunostomy tube. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with pressor amines support, with multiple organ failure secondary to abdominal sepsis, and died 24hours later. Later, a peritoneal fluid culture was received where yeast Gram is reported, low levels of polymorphonuclear cells and Candida albicans. Cytochemical examination of unclear peritoneal fluid, leukocytes 10.710mm, 3  polymorphonuclear cells 90% with crenocytes, piocytes, bacteria and mononuclear cells 10%.

149,S2212-5558(13)00234-2,Mantle cell lymphoma of the palate: A case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 70-year-old man was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery of the Enfant-Jésus hospital by his dentist to evaluate a palatal mass that had led to the instability of his denture. The patient's medical history was significant for hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and benign prostate hyperplasia for which he was taking Micardis, Plaquenil, Celebrex, Methotrexate and Flomax. He did not smoke or take alcohol. The patient had noticed the lesion for the past year. There was no associated pain or changes in sensation on either the palate or adjacent structures. He had no weight loss, nocturnal sweating or fever, however, he did suffer from abdominal pain for 2–3 months prior to the discovery of the lesion. The intra-oral examination revealed a red and ulcerated lesion of 25mm×17mm at the junction of the hard palate and the maxillary right alveolar process. No abnormal cervical, axillary or inguinal lymph nodes were palpable. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were within normal limits. A computerized axial tomography scan (CT scan) of the head and neck revealed a homogenous and non-invading lesion of 25mm×17mm×7mm. No abnormal cervical lymph nodes were noted. The cerebral, thoracic, and abdominal CT scan were normal. An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed and revealed a diffused monomorphous lymphoid infiltrate composed of dense small cells with slightly irregular nuclei and without nucleoli (Fig. 1A and B). Immunohistochemical reactions established the immunophenotype of the atypical lymphoid cells that expressed markers for CD20, CD5, CD43, Bcl-1 and Bcl-2 antigens (Fig. 2A–C). The cytogenetic analysis revealed a translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) causing an over expression of the Bcl-1 gene, a characteristic specific to the MCL [2]. A hematology consultation was requested. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and revealed the presence of small atypical lymphocytic aggregates with immunohistochemical and cytogenetic profiles similar to the ones of the palate, confirming the diffuse nature of the disease. In accordance with the Ann Arbor classification, the patient was diagnosed with a stage IV-A MCL. The patient underwent eight cycles of systemic polychemotherapy consisting of Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicine, Vincristine and Prednisone in association with Rituximab. Multiple relapses, the first one 10 months after the beginning of chemotherapy, were noted and the patient died a few years later due to an unrelated disease. "

152,S2090-1232(14)00058-7,Development of a low grade lymphoma in the mastoid bone in a patient with atypical Cogan’s syndrome: A case report," Discussion In 1945 Cogan’s described a clinical entity which consisted of ocular manifestations of non-syphilic interstitial keratitis and of audiovestibular manifestations of Meniere-like symptoms. Meniere-like symptoms in Cogan’s syndrome are bilateral, more pronounced, long lasting and may lead to more severe vestibular abnormalities, such as ataxia or oscillopsia. That entity was called after his name and is known till today as Cogan’s syndrome. Later in 1980, Haynes et al. broadened the diagnostic criteria and enclosed other ocular and audiovestibular manifestations and manifestations from other organs, all of which are known as atypical forms of Cogan’s syndrome. Haynes et al. proposed the criteria by which atypical Cogan’s syndrome would be recognized and these include: (1) inflammatory ocular manifestations (episcleritis, scleritis, choroiditis, papilloedema, retinal hemorrhage, retinal artery occlusion, exophthalmos or tendonitis) in the presence or absence of interstitial keratitis, isolated conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage or iritis only in combination with Meniere like symptoms within 2years of symptoms onset, (2) audiovestibular symptoms other than Meniere like manifestations combined with typical ocular manifestations within 2years of symptoms onset and (3) the presence of typical ocular and audiovestibular manifestations in a period of time more than 2years between them [1–3]. There are no specific laboratory tests for diagnosing Cogan’s syndrome, except the exclusion of syphilis by serological test. In clinical practice it is sometimes difficult to classify between typical or atypical Cogan’s syndrome, because its physical history may vary considerably. Audiovestibular disturbances can proceed or can appear simultaneously or it may follow ocular manifestations. However, since vestibuloauditory manifestations may precede other symptoms and signs, diagnosis of Cogan’s syndrome should not be overlooked by ophthalmologists in all patients with delayed recurrent ocular inflammation associated with vestibuloauditory symptoms. According to a work of the Study Group for Cogan’s Syndrome [1] ocular and audiovestibular manifestations occurred closely or even simultaneously in most cases with typical Cogan’s syndrome whereas in atypical Cogan’s syndrome the mean interval between the mentioned manifestations was 27.1months. Table 1  summarizes various signs and symptoms other than ocular and audiovestibular manifestations that can be present, both in typical and in atypical forms of syndrome [1,2]. Although the classification of a patient in typical or atypical Cogan’s syndrome can be misleading, the existing data are not efficient enough to prove that this classification can have an effect on treatment plan or patient outcome. Cogan’s syndrome is recently being regarded as an autoimmune disorder due to the presence of autoantibodies against the inner ear and endothelium. In mice preclinical models it has been proved that the intravenous administration of autoantibodies found in patients with Cogan’s syndrome reproduced the classic pathologic manifestations of the syndrome, such as tissue damage of inner ear, endothelial cells and cornea [4]. The association of atypical Cogan’s syndrome with systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and Wegener’s granulomatosis has also been described and in suspected atypical Cogan’s syndrome investigation aims to rule out systemic lupus erythematosus and Adamantiades-Behcet’s disease. In addition, it has been proposed that patients with atypical Cogan’s syndrome may be at higher risk of developing neurological symptoms, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly [1]. Approximately, 70% of these patients have systemic manifestations, of which vasculitis is considered the pathogenic mechanism and therefore carries a less favorable prognosis than typical Cogan’s syndrome [1,5]. In a retrospective review two patients with Cogan’s syndrome had a history of B-cell lymphoma but in none of them malignancy was developed on the preexisting autoimmune lesion [2]. Recently an atypical Cogan’s syndrome presenting as bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis in a woman with ovarian cancer was reported [6]. The control of symptoms is achieved mainly by the administration of glucocorticosteroids. The most responsive symptoms are the ocular ones (as in our patient), in contrast to the audiovestibular manifestations which are more resistant to therapy. The sooner the steroid administration from the onset of symptoms the better the outcome is. Ocular symptoms are managed quite sufficiently and permanent visual loss has rarely been reported, in contrast to audiovestibular manifestations which after consecutive deterioration usually lead to permanent deafness [1]. After failure of glucocorticosteroids, “second line” therapy is immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cyclosporine. The best responses have been observed with methotrexate [1,7]. Infliximab might be an alternative therapy for Cogan’s syndrome, especially in cases where corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy have failed. Treatment might be more effective when started at an early stage of the inner-ear disease, when the lesions are still reversible [8]. Apart from the administration of the aforementioned agents, surgical interventional techniques such as cochlear implants or hearing aids devices have reported promising results with improved hearing capacity [9–11]. Our patient suffered from atypical form of Cogan’s syndrome and developed B-cell low grade NHL in the mastoid bone. Her NHL responded well to therapy, but Cogan’s syndrome symptoms gradually worsened with the additional cutaneous and institutional manifestations. We speculate that the development of NHL was not accidental, but occurred on the basis of the preexisting immune abnormality and the anatomical distribution of NHL occurred to the organ “target” for Cogan’s syndrome that is the inner ear. In line with this, literature indicates the high risk of NHL development mainly in major autoimmune diseases and the anatomical relationship between them, such as the NHL development in target organs such as glandular parotid in Sjogren’s syndrome [12].

156,S2352-5126(15)00085-5,Discordant mycosis fungoides and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma: A case report and review of the literature," Case report An 81-year-old immunocompetent woman presented to the dermatology department on referral from her primary care physician for treatment of a pruritic rash. The rash had been present on her trunk for approximately 18 months, and to the knowledge of the patient, the lesions all presented at the same time. She otherwise felt well with no complaints of fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Upon examination, the patient was found to have multiple pink, scaly patches and plaques clinically suggestive of MF on the trunk and bilateral axillae (Fig 1 ) in addition to 2 erythematous, indurated plaques on the mid back (Fig 2 ). There was no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. A biopsy of the plaque at the right portion of the upper chest, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, found enlarged lymphocytes with hyperchromatic irregular nuclei. Epidermotropism and focal Pautrier microabscesses were present. The papillary dermis was hyalinized. The lymphocytes were highlighted on CD3 staining, and most cells expressed CD4 with little CD8 expression. No significant CD20 staining was present. Periodic acidised CD4 staining was negative for fungal organisms. The histologic findings were consistent with MF. Biopsies of the right and left mid back found a dense, diffuse infiltrate of predominantly lymphocytes with histiocytes and occasional plasma cells. The lymphocytes were not significantly enlarged and had angulated to round nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. CD20 and CD79a highlighted most of the lymphocytes and a smaller population of CD3+ lymphocytes was seen at the base of the lesion. Kappa and Lambda staining highlighted plasma cells, but no significant clonal shift was identified. B- and T-cell gene rearrangement was performed, and a B-cell (IgH) clone was identified. Additional immunostaining was performed and the morphologic features, together with the immunophenotype (CD20+, CD79a+, bcl6+, bcl2+partial, CD10?) and identification of a B-cell clone, was most suggestive of a low-grade B-cell lymphoma (Figs 3 and 4  ). In situ hybridization stain for Epstein Barr virus was also performed, and results were negative. On referral to the oncology department, laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 6,760, hemoglobin of 12.5, platelet count of 127,000, and basophilia with a basophil count of 3.8%. Sezary cell count showed 5% lymphocytes with features consistent with Sezary cells. Computed tomography scan of the chest found a 3.3-cm enlarged node in the preaortic space, small bilateral axillary adenopathy, and small bilateral pulmonary nodules worrisome for metastatic disease. Bone marrow biopsy found increased numbers of T cells both in small lymphoid aggregates and scattered diffusely through the marrow. Flow cytometry found gating on 19% of cells, 87% CD3, 73% CD4/CD3, and 10% CD8/CD3. Left axillary lymph node histology found small to medium lymphoid cells with some nuclear irregularity and inconspicuous nucleoli. The cells showed lack of expression of CD30 on immunohistochemical staining. Cytometry found an abundance of T lymphocytes, of which most expressed CD4 and were negative for CD8. The cells also expressed CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7. The staging for her T-cell lymphoma was stage IVb. The patient was initially treated with pazopanib and experienced no improvement after 2 months of 200-mg daily therapy. Cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide were also considered as treatment options. Because of persistent and significant pruritus, the patient was started on systemic psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy which provided symptomatic improvement. Further systemic chemotherapy was offered and declined by the patient. "

158,S1028-4559(14)00210-1,Primary natural killer/T cell lymphoma of the cervix: Case report and clinicopathological analysis," Case Report A 54-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital complaining of difficulty in micturition. She denied hematuria, odynuria, and other unusual symptoms. Her complaints did not improve after treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical examination revealed a hard, irregular uterus and a relaxed vagina without well-defined masses. Ultrasonography showed a multiple myoma in the cervix and cervical cysts. A complete blood count revealed the following: hemoglobin, 94.0 g/L; white blood cell count, 3.2 × 109/L, with a differential count of 65% segmented neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, 2.5% monocytes, 0% basophils, and 0.5% eosinophils. Total abdominal hysterectomy and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The specimen was sent to the Department of Pathology for pathological–anatomical analysis. Grossly, the specimen consisted of a uterus, cervix, and unilateral adnexa. The uterus measured 10 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm. The cervix contained a soft, irregularly outlined, pinkish-grey tumor located primarily outside the cervical canal with a maximum diameter of 4 cm. An intramural, white 1.5-cm leiomyoma was present. The endometrium and left ovary and fallopian tube were grossly unremarkable. Histologically, the whole wall of the cervix was infiltrated by neoplastic cells, but the squamous epithelium and endocervical glands were not infiltrated or destroyed (Fig. 1 A). There was a diffuse dense lymphoid infiltrate, with prominent coagulative necrosis and apoptotic bodies. An angiocentric and angiodestructive growth pattern was frequently present (Fig. 1B). Higher magnification showed that neoplastic lymphoid cells invaded and destroyed the blood vessel walls of the cervical stroma, and lymphoid cells were atypical, medium-sized with irregular nuclear contours and scanty cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic lymphoid cells expressed T-cell- and NK-cell-associated antigens such as CD3 (Fig. 2 A), CD43, CD56 (Fig. 2B), granzyme-B and T–cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1) (Fig. 2C), but were negative for CD20, CD79a, CD38 and CD138. Proliferative activity was assessed by Molecular Immunology Borstel number 1 antibody (MIB-1) and reached 70% of the tumor cells. An in situ hybridization analysis for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) RNA was positive (Fig. 2D). Polymerase chain reaction studies showed evidence of a monoclonal T cell receptor gene rearrangement (Fig. 3 ). The histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular studies were interpreted as a nasal-type NK/T cell lymphoma arising in the cervix. The endometrium and unilateral adnexa were not involved. Two months after the operation, the patient presented with high fever, painful urination, dysuria, and hematuria. Renal failure followed, and the family members of the patient refused further treatment. "

Neurologic examination revealed ataxic gait and gazed-evoked nystagmus more accentuated when looking down with upward gaze limitation. Laboratory examination showed moderate thrombocytopenia (104,000; normal values 150–440,000/?L) and lymphocytopenia (860/?L; normal values 1200–3500/?L). Brain CT scan was normal but brain-MRI findings (Fig. 1  ; Panels A & B) were consistent with “butterfly glioma”. Lumbar puncture showed marked lymphocytosis (2224/?L; normal values 0–5/?L), increased protein (2.42g/L; normal values 0.15–0.45g/L), while PCR for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) showed 62,700/mL copies of the virus in the CSF. Blood serology was positive for HIV-1. CD4 count was low (132/?L; normal values 410–1590/?L). Pulmonary CT scan was normal and careful clinical examination excluded lymphadenopathy that would suggest non-Hodgkin lymphoma and secondary CNS involvement. One week after admission the patient deteriorated rapidly and showed signs of intracranial hypertension on brain CT and had an external ventricular drain. Stereotactic brain-biopsy revealed a B-cell cerebral lymphoma (Fig. 1 ; Panels C & D). The patient continued to deteriorate despite IV treatment with corticosteroids and ganciclovir, went into a coma and deceased from diffuse cerebral edema a week after biopsy. Autopsy was declined by the patient's family. "

Prior to our encounter, he was suspected of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but he had been followed up without treatment. A computed tomographic scan showed multiple lymph node swelling; the largest nodal mass, submandibular lesion, measured about 4cm. White blood count was 6800/?l and that of eosinophils was 17%. His LDH level was 247U/L (normal range: 120–240) and his soluble interleukin-2 (sIL-2) receptor level was 3810U/ml (normal range: 145–519). Antibodies against human T-cell leukemia virus-1 were not detected. A first biopsy was performed on the submandibular lymph node. At that time, a suspected histological diagnosis of either c-HL or peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), was made. As c-HL was strongly suggested, the patient was treated with three cycles of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy. His disease initially showed good response, but recurred with cervical lymph node enlargement after 3 years. At that time, white blood count was 4800/?l and that of eosinophils was 0.5%. A second biopsy led to the diagnosis of AITL, and he received 5 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, oncovin, prednisone) chemotherapy with good response. However, he had fever from the time of the end of his chemotherapy. His fever was considered tumor fever or infection, and he received antibiotic and antifungal drugs. His general condition continued to worsen, and he died 5 years after the initial diagnosis. An autopsy was performed, and the cause of death was identified as relapse of the H–RS like cells. "

Past medical history was significant for rheumatoid arthritis treated with prednisone and azathioprine. Physical exam was unremarkable and no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was noted. Laboratory studies revealed white blood count 3500/µL and hemoglobin 8.6g/dL. Colonoscopy showed mass lesions at the cecum and splenic flexure, and biopsies showed adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent right extended hemicolectomy to the splenic flexure. Gross examination revealed a surgical specimen measuring 35cm with a 6.6×3.2cm2 soft, tan, exophytic mass with focal mucosal ulceration at the cecum ( Figure 1A) grossly invading the bowel wall and a 6.5×4.5cm2 ulcerated lesion in the descending colon (Figure 1B) with heaped-up margins and necrotic appearing central area that was grossly invading the subserosal fat. The terminal ileum and appendix were unremarkable. Histologic examination of the cecal mass showed tubulovillous adenoma (Figure 1C and E) with foci of high grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma in situ, while the descending colon mass showed low grade adenocarcinoma with a focus of high grade component (Figure 1D and F) invading through the muscularis propria. Extensive moderate-to-large atypical lymphocytic infiltrates with increased mitotic activity were noted at the base of both lesions (Figure 1C and F). Immunohistochemistry of the lymphocytic infiltrates at both sites were strongly and diffusely positive for CD20, positive for lambda, and negative for kappa, while CD3 highlighted some background mature T-cells ( Figure 2A–C). EBV encoding region in situ hybridization (EBER ISH) in the atypical B-cells was positive (Figure 2D). Expression of DNA mismatch repair proteins in the descending colon mass was found to be intact. The patient was discharged twelve days after resection. No chemotherapy was initiated and the patient was instructed to discontinue prednisone and azathioprine. No recurrence was noted six months after the procedure. "

Compared with other acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), its clinical presentation is less predictable and is characterized by rapid clinical changes. The paradigm shift to treat HIV-BL with highly effective intensive chemotherapy regimens and to manage immunosuppression has enabled physicians to offer and achieve remission and long-term survival. The authors present a challenging case of a 33-year- old HIV-positive (HIV+) man with advanced-stage BL. The patient presented with severe cachexia, clinical symptomatic cord compression, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 4; his care involved providers that would recommend palliation only. The patient tolerated induction chemotherapy and remains in remission. This is a case-based review of the clinical presentation and the trial data supporting different treatment options for immunodeficiency-associated BL. "

170,S2213-0071(15)00016-7,Systemic-to-pulmonary venous shunt in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma: A case report and review of the literature," Discussion SVC obstruction and secondary SVC syndrome are caused by malignancy in 85% of cases [1]. With venous flow obstruction, collateral venous plexuses are formed to maintain venous drainage from the upper extremities, head and neck into the right side of the heart. The most common collateral plexuses are the azygos, the internal/external mammary, the lateral thoracic and the vertebral [2–4]. SPVSs are an extremely rare form of collaterals after SVC obstruction. There are only 22 reports of SPVSs in the literature, and the majority of those cases were in patients with lung cancer. Instead of draining into the right side of the heart, SPVSs drain systemic venous blood directly into the left side of the heart, causing a right-to-left shunt. The most common clinical manifestations of SPVS are dyspnea and hypoxia; rarely, paradoxical embolic events, cerebral abscesses and high cardiac output can occur [3,5,6]. In our patient, the right-to-left shunt was contributing to his symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia, caused by the initial pleural effusion. After drainage of the fluid, the severity of the symptoms was out of proportion to the remnant small pleural effusion, which could be explained by the presence of the SPVS. No other signs of right-to-left shunt complications were evidenced in the patient. SPVSs are categorized as 1) congenital, 2) anatomical or 3) acquired [3,5]. Congenital causes of SPVS consist of aberrant pulmonary veins with anomalous reversed flow, embryonic remnants of anastomosis between the cardinal system and pulmonary veins and a persistent left SVC that drains into the left atrium or pulmonary veins [3,5]. Anatomical variations occur when there are preexisting bronchial venous plexuses connecting the bronchial and pulmonary veins [3,5]. If there is SVC obstruction, the systemic venous pressure rises, causing incompetence of the intervening valves and leading to venous reflux into the pulmonary veins [3]. Acquired SPVSs are formed in chronic inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, mediastinitis, chest radiation and chronic pleural effusions [7–9]. Liebow was the first to describe an acquired SPVS. He observed that in severely emphysematous lungs, chronic inflammation led to the formation of new intrapleural vessels [9]. He also described the development of these abnormal pulmonary collaterals upon ligation of the pulmonary veins of dogs [9]. During chronic inflammatory states, growth factors are released into the intrapleural space, leading to angiogenesis. The newly created vessels cross the pleura and create plexuses communicating the innominate and pulmonary veins [2,5,6,9]. If inflammation continues, the vessels will surround the airways and hilum, creating the bridging veins that on CT are observed crossing from the pleura to the mediastinum and into the pulmonary veins. In our patient, the SPVS was most likely secondary to the inflammation caused by the large pleural effusion, a mechanism already described in the literature [2,7,8]. We cannot completely rule out anatomical variations in this case, however; better imaging, such as venography, would be required to make that determination. Various imaging modalities are available for the diagnosis of SPVS. CT venography and conventional venography have the advantage of three-dimensional reconstruction and better visualization of the site of venous blockage, vessel anatomy, delineation of the collaterals and venous hemodynamics [4,10]. Tests such as scintigraphy with technetium-99m, echocardiography with agitated saline through all extremities, cardiovascular CT, magnetic resonance imaging/angiography and cardiac catheterization are described in the literature as diagnostic methods for SPVS [2,4,8,10,11]. Conventional CT with intravenous contrast has become the most common mode of diagnosis due to its wide availability. The typical findings on chest CT suggestive of SPVS are 1) evidence of intravenous contrast in the left cardiac chambers before its appearance in the right chambers, 2) evidence of multiple thick enhancing peripheral bridging veins and 3) prominent pleural enhancement—all in the setting of SVC obstruction [3,5,10]. In our patient's CT scan there was evidence of pleural enhancement and thick peripheral bridging veins draining into the pulmonary vein (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of early left chamber filling because the CT scan was not performed on first pass of the contrast. Our finding of an SPVS was obvious only when contrast was injected through the upper right extremity, not the left, suggesting that the shunt drained only the upper right extremity and right hemithorax. Treatment for SPVSs is usually observant, as the majority of cases have been associated with only minimal hypoxia. However, the patient should be treated for the underlying cause of SVC obstruction and management of symptoms of SVC syndrome. In cases of anatomical or congenital SPVS, surgical or endovascular treatments have been described [6]. In our literature search we did not find reports of SPVSs that resolved after resolution of the SVC obstruction. An explanation might be that mortality in these cases was close after an SPVS diagnosis. "
174,S0168-8278(14)00725-9,"Rapid clearance of HCV-related splenic marginal zone lymphoma under an interferon-free, NS3/NS4A inhibitor-based treatment. A case report"," Case report The patient is a 42-years old Caucasian male who tested HCV positive in 2003 during a routine medical evaluation. The infection was sustained by a genotype 1b virus. Liver disease appeared with minimal activity: a biopsy performed in 2010 showed a METAVIR F0 fibrosis score and a Fibrotest performed in February 2012 confirmed a score of 0.14, again within the F0 stage. Aminotransferase levels remained below 2× the upper limit of normal. Low-titre mixed cryoglobulinemia was present but without any clinical manifestation. Patient had an unfavourable IL28B genotype (CT) and never started any antiviral treatment. Starting in 2007, the blood tests showed an increased lymphocyte cell count, associated with mild splenomegaly (diameter: 15.8cm). A total-body CT-scan was performed and it confirmed enlargement of the spleen without any other pathological findings. Given the slight worsening of blood parameters in 2011, the patient underwent a haematologic evaluation. The blood flow cytometry analysis is summarized in Table 1 . The immune-phenotype analysis depicted a B cell lineage CD20+ clonal expansion with total K light chain restriction. The blood smear documented the presence of peripheral lymphocytes with an atypical, villous morphology. Haemoglobin level was normal (147g/L), the platelet count was slightly decreased (142×109 cells/L) while the leukocyte count was increased (10.46×109 cells/L) mainly because of the raised lymphocytes value (5.65×109 cells/L, 54%). No invasive diagnostic procedures (bone marrow and spleen histology) were considered since cytology and flow cytometry were deemed adequately, consistent with the diagnosis of a chronic B cell lymphoproliferative disorder like SMZL (previously described as splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes), belonging to the low-risk group according to the FIL prognostic model [9]. In the following months the patient started complaining of mild abdominal discomfort; the splenomegaly increased, reaching a diameter of 17.5cm. The haematologist did not recommend any systemic chemotherapy but suggested antiviral treatment. The patient was unwilling to start a standard IFN-based regimen because he was concerned about its relevant side-effects, so he was screened for the BI 12.41.20 trial, where an all-oral, IFN-free regimen, based on the combination of a NS3/NS4A inhibitor (faldaprevir, FDV) and a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor (deleobuvir, DLV) was evaluated. Although the presence of an active malignancy would represent an exclusion criteria, the Sponsor was informed of the indolent course of the disease and of the possible haemato-oncologic improvements, deriving from an antiviral treatment, thus this major protocol violation was allowed. The Institutional Review Board was informed of this protocol violation as well, but no issues were raised. The patient was then considered eligible for the study and on March 26, 2013 he started treatment with FDV 120mg once daily, DLV 600mg twice daily and RBV 1000mg per day. The treatment lasted 16weeks. Fig. 1  shows the virologic response over time and the trend of haematologic parameters (total leukocyte counts, absolute lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte percentages at any time point. The virologic response was very fast: after 2weeks the viral load was at the limit of detectability and from week 4 on it remained undetectable. The haematologic parameters improved quite rapidly as well. The absolute lymphocyte count improved considerably after 4weeks of treatment and it was 3.73×109 cells/L (within the range of normality, i.e. 0.91–4.28×109 cells/L) at the following visit (week 8). The logistic regression analysis suggested a statistically significant correlation between the viral decay and lymphocyte improvement (coefficient r=0.55, p =0.042). On the contrary, the total leukocyte count did not show any correlation (r=0.45, p =0.106). The spleen size returned to normal on physical examination after 8weeks of treatment. At the last medical evaluation, performed 48weeks after the end of treatment, the patient maintained the sustained virologic response, while the total leukocyte count was 6.89×109 cells/L with 3.31×109 cells/L lymphocytes (48.0%). The last ultrasonography performed after the end of the antiviral treatment found a spleen diameter of 14.2cm (decrease of 3.3cm from the last pre-therapy ultrasonographic assessment). The blood smear documented no peripheral lymphocytes with villous morphology. The immune-phenotype analysis depicted still a mature B cell lineage expansion with a Kappa clonal origin, but it was considerably reduced; indeed total B cell counts dropped from 4.08 to 0.87×109 cell/L. The CD19/CD11c co-expression was significantly less relevant (Table 1). The investigational regimen proved to be well-tolerated; the only side effect was a mild jaundice related to FDV. From week 12 to week 16 the patient had several episodes of febrile bacterial sinusitis, which needed a course of antibiotic treatment with full recovery. These events were not considered to be related to the investigational treatment. "
175,S2213-0489(18)30006-2,The fear of lymphadenopathy: A cautionary case of sarcoidosis masquerading as recurrent diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)," 2 Case report A 70-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history which included gastroesophageal reflux disease, episodic gout, and benign prostatic hypertrophy presented to medical attention with asymptomatic and painless left groin adenopathy of several weeks duration. After a concerted effort to lose thirty pounds through diet and exercise, he no longer required medications to control hypertension or hyperlipidemia. His family history was unremarkable. He had never been a smoker, but did report exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam 50 years earlier. His physical exam was within normal limits, except for bilateral shotty groin adenopathy, and a 2.5?cm palpable right axillary node. An ultrasound of the left groin showed a 2.5?cm cystic-appearing mass. A core needle biopsy of the mass revealed lymphoma. Flow cytometry findings included a monoclonal B-cell population expressing CD20, CD5, CD10 (partial), CD19, CD38, CD22, CD25 (partial), CD11c (partial), and CD8 (partial). B cells were negative for CD23, CD3, CD103, and FMC-7. He subsequently underwent an excisional biopsy of a left inguinal lymph node, which revealed DLBCL not otherwise specified ( Fig. 1A). By immunohistochemistry analysis, the cells expressed CD5, CD10 (weak), CD79a, BCL-2, BCL-6, MUM-1, and Pax-5. Cells were negative for CD3, CD30, and Cyclin D1. The Ki-67 index was greater than 95% (Fig. 1B). Given the high Ki-67 index and unusual co-expression of CD5 and CD10 antigens, the tissue was sent to the lymphoma branch at the National Institutes of Health for further review where the diagnosis of non-germinal CD5+ DLBCL was confirmed. There was further agreement that the expression of CD10 was unusual, but given the strong MUM1 expression, activated B-cell phenotype (ABC type) was favored. Additional laboratory studies included the following: a normal complete blood count and hepatic panel; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 530 U/L (normal <243); and beta-2 microglobulin of 3.0?mcg/mL (normal <2.70). Hepatitis A, B and C viral assays were pan negative as was an HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. A CT-PET scan showed hypermetabolic axillary, splenic, and retroperitoneal adenopathy with standardized uptake values (SUV) ranging between 25 and 30 ( Fig. 2A). A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed no morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of DLBCL. A multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fracture of 64%, and a lumbar spinal puncture to assess for leptomeningeal lymphoma proved unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with stage IVA DLBCL with an R-IPI score of four (i.e., age greater than 60, advanced stage, more than one extra-nodal site, and elevated LDH). After three cycles of R-CHOP, an interim CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed marked interval improvement in the diffuse adenopathy with shrinkage of his axillary and para-aortic lymph nodes as well as his liver and splenic nodules. His first four cycles proved otherwise uneventful but with his fifth cycle, he was hospitalized for treatment of a neutropenic fever. He received empiric parenteral antibiotics for culture-negative pneumonia. There was a two-week delay in treatment before he received a sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy. A post-treatment CT-PET scan showed an excellent response to chemotherapy with marked reduction in hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy and resolution of splenic and hepatic nodules. There was, however, continued hypermetabolic activity involving the splenic hilum corresponding with an SUV of 11.5 (Fig. 2B). He received 40?Gy of consolidative radiotherapy over four weeks to that area. Three months later, a repeat CT-PET scan showed multiple enlarged FDG-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm with an SUV range from 12.6 to 25 (Fig. 2C). Brain magnetic resonance imaging and a lumbar puncture proved unremarkable and further laboratory assessment included a white blood cell count of 3?×?109/L with an unremarkable differential, hematocrit of 43%, and platelet count of 100?×?109/L. Electrolytes and renal function were all in the normal range, and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were 47 U/L (normal < 40) and 51 U/L (normal < 44), respectively. Serum LDH was 192 U/L and ?2 microglobulin was 2.94?mcg/mL. Quantitative immunoglobulins were within normal limits and a serum protein electrophoresis did not reveal a monoclonal gammopathy. Given the CT-PET scan findings suggestive of relapsed DLBCL and the known aggressive nature of lymphoma recurring within 12 months of R-CHOP, the patient sought opinions at various medical centers. Options that he received for presumed relapsed DLBCL included standard salvage therapy with R-ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), R-DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin), and R-GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin) for 2–3 cycles, followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) if his DLBCL proved chemo-sensitive. The patient was further offered participation in a randomized trial of R-ICE alone versus R-ICE with an anti-CD19 antibody-drug conjugate. Another potential choice included high-dose anti-CD45 radiolabeled antibody and BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) as a prelude to ASCT. And lastly, he was presented with the option of participating in a clinical trial of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy with a novel anti-CD19 construct plus durvalumab (a PD-L1 antibody). This was the choice he ultimately settled on after much deliberation and angst. To confirm pathologic recurrence as a necessary requisite prior to clinical trial participation, the patient underwent an endo-bronchial ultrasound with trans-bronchial biopsies of several enlarged mediastinal and para-tracheal nodes. Fine needle biopsy revealed multiple non-necrotizing granulomas, without evidence of recurrent lymphoma. He additionally underwent a core needle biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node which also revealed granulomatous lymphadenitis with nearly complete replacement of normal lymph node architecture with non-caseating granuloma and no evidence of recurrent lymphoma, and with findings clearly favoring sarcoidosis ( Fig. 3, A-C). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) showed a normal forced vital capacity (FVC) with an FVC ??80% of predicted, with normal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) with a FEV1???80% predicted, normal FEV1/FVC ??0.7, and only a mildly reduced diffusing capacity (DLCO) of 64%. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was mildly elevated at 79 U/L (normal 8–53). No ocular manifestations of sarcoidosis were identified by exam or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Although intensely anxious due to persistent concerns that he might have recurrent DLBCL, he experienced no pulmonary symptoms (i.e., cough, dyspnea), nor did he have fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. He was diagnosed with stage I sarcoidosis and no systemic therapy was recommended. Twelve months later the patient remains well and without recurrent DLBCL. "

Clinical examination revealed a pain-free hard mass involving the horizontal branch of the mandible, without any cutaneous involvement. At oral examination obstruction of the entire inferior vestibule was found. The patient didn't suffer from human immunodeficiency virus infection. She did not complain of bleeding, and no significant clinical data were present in her clinical history. Computerized tomography (CT) was available (Figs. 1 and 2  ). On panoramic Rx, the area affected by the lesion showed osteolysis with almost indistinct borders, root resorption of the 33, destructive tooth decay with bone resorption at the furcation of 36; these signs in association with the absence of inflammation, purulent discharge and pain were inclined to the diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Therefore it was decided to perform a CT scan and biopsy immediately. On CT images, tumor involvement of the bone marrow cortex and of the surrounding soft tissue was reported. Subsequently to careful evaluation of these radiological findings, a fine needle cytology (FNC) was performed, in order to assess the proper diagnosis of the lesion. Based on the final diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), she started chemotherapy according to the R-CHOP-21 regimen that was based on the original doses used by the GELA group and consisted of intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m, doxorubicin 50 mg/m, vincristine 1.4 mg/m (maximum dose 2 mg), rituximab 375 mg/m on day 1, and oral prednisolone 40 mg/m on days 1–5, administered every 21 days for a total of eight cycles [10]. The patient at the end of the eight cycles will be visited every two months in very close follow-up. To date, she has completed 3 cycles of therapy and clinical response was good with the disappearance of the mandibular swelling. If a recurrence or persistence of the disease will be detected, the patient will undergo IEV (Ifosfamide, Epirubicin, Etoposide) or DHAP (Cisplatin, Ara-C, Dexamethasone) therapy, with subsequent mobilization and autologous stem cell [11]. Before the second scheme of chemotherapy in case of recurrence of the tumor, a new procedure for testing tumor stem cells sensibility to the chemotherapy will be performed. Because of about 21 days need for test response and necessity to start for immediate chemotherapy at the diagnosis, this method was not used at the first cycle.   2.2 Case 2 A 76-year-old woman presented with a left parotid swelling in the left parotid area and a palpable ipsilateral submental lymph node. The patient reported that she had noticed the left side of her face growing progressively larger over the past 4 months. The patient denied any history of fever, night sweats, or significant weight loss. Medical and social history were not significant. Computerized tomography (CT) was available (Fig. 3 ). A fine needle cytology (FNC), performed on the periparotideal mass diagnosed an NHL, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the following surgical biopsy. Based on the final diagnosis of B-cell NHL the patient was treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) for 6 cycles. At the end of the six cycles will be visited every two months in very close follow-up. To date, she has completed 4 cycles of therapy and clinical response was good with the disappearance of the parotid swelling. If a recurrence or persistence of the disease will be detected, the patient will undergo IEV (Ifosfamide, Epirubicin, Etoposide) or DHAP (Cisplatin, Ara-C, Dexamethasone) therapy, with subsequent mobilization and autologous stem cell.

179,S0190-9622(14)01261-4,Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma with diffuse CD30 expression: A report of 4 cases of a rare variant,"Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) represents about 10% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas, typically manifesting with solitary or grouped plaques, nodules, or tumors preferentially involving the head and neck area and trunk. 1-4  The Crosti lymphoma variant, the miliary agminated type of PCFCL, featuring large lesions on the back, an association with alopecia, and some other unusual clinical presentations have been reported. 5-9  The neoplasm is composed of neoplastic follicular center cells, namely centrocytes with a variable number of centroblasts, growing in a follicular, follicular and diffuse, or diffuse growth pattern. 10-12  A rare morphologic variation manifests with spindle cell centrocytes. 13  Independent of the growth pattern, the neoplastic cells stain positive for pan B-markers (eg, CD79a, CD20, and PAX-5) and for bcl-6, which stains germinal center cells. CD10 and bcl-2 expression is variable, whereas multiple myeloma-1/interferon regulatory factor-4 (MUM-1/IRF-4) is always negative, as usually are cytoplasmic immunoglobulins M and D. 14,15  CD30 is a transmembrane glycoprotein representing a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that plays a role in regulating the function or proliferation of normal lymphoid cells. 16  CD30 is expressed by activated lymphocytes in pseudolymphomas and tumor cells in lymphomas. 17,18  With respect to cutaneous lymphomas, CD30 expression is a defining feature of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), the entities constituting a clinicopathologic spectrum of a diagnostic category referred to as CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (CD30+ LPDs). 19-21  Various other cutaneous T-cell lymphomas may express CD30 at various levels. 19  In B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, expression of CD30 was found in one-third of nodal follicular lymphomas. 22  In contrast to nodal follicular lymphoma, expression of CD30 in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) by the majority of tumor cells, however, seems to be a rare finding, with only a single report described in the literature. 23  We analyzed PCFCL for the expression of CD30 and present here 4 cases of PCFCL with extensive CD30 expression by the almost all neoplastic cells."
180,S2211-0348(17)30151-7,A case of lymphoma in a patient on teriflunomide treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis," 2 Case report A 54-year-old black woman native to a French Caribbean island, with a history of thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter (treatment with levothyroxine 75µg daily), surgery on mammary adenofibroma and on uterine fibroid had her first neurological symptoms in 2013, when she experienced balance difficulties for a period of about two months. In February 2015, the patient noticed sensory abnormalities, paresthesis in both hands, right foot and at thoracic level (numbness, tingling, sensations of electric discharges). She was then hospitalized. A cervical MRI revealed a hyperintense lesion of T2-weighted sequences at C3-C4 level. On brain MRI there were multiple nodular, periventricular, and brainstem hyperintense lesions on FLAIR-weighted sequences, with gadolinium ring enhancement on the periventricular lesions. A lumbar puncture was performed showing an intrathecal synthesis. The 2010 McDonald criteria were thus met, and a relapsing form of MS was diagnosed. A treatment with teriflunomide was begun in June 2015. In February 2016, she noted the appearance of an inguinal ganglion measuring about 2–3cm, isolated. Neither ultrasound nor an abdominal CT scan revealed any further ganglia. A ganglion biopsy was performed in May 2016 ( Fig. 1) diagnosing a Grade 1–2 follicular B-cell lymphoma according to WHO, strictly localized to the right inguinal level. Myelogram was normal, especially with no clonal B lymphoid population. A focal inguinal irradiation was decided (total dose administered 24Gy) in October 2016, followed by complete clinical remission. The case was submitted to the French national pharmacovigilance database. Teriflunomide was discontinued in June 2016, and the patient was started on glatiramer acetate in July. Importantly, apart from age, our patient had none of the known risk factors for FL: persons with a first-degree relative with NHL, with greater body mass index as a young adult, former spray painters and women with Sjögren syndrome or with current and longer duration of cigarette use have an increased risk for FL (Linet et al., 2014). Indeed, given our patient's race, her risk was actually lower: In the United States, the incidence of FL is approximately 3-fold lower in black women compared to white women (Groves et al., 2000). Finally, the use of levothyroxine - the only other drug our patient was on- is not associated with an increased risk of lymphoma (Bartalena et al., 1996). "
181,S0363-5023(14)00128-2,Lymphoma of the Hands in a Patient With Rheumatoid Arthritis: Case Report," Case Report A 77-year-old woman with a 20-year history of seropositive RA involving both hands presented to her primary care provider because of an enlarging mass in the left hand. She had been receiving twice-weekly methotrexate for RA for several years. There was no history of trauma, and there were no constitutional symptoms of fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Energy and appetite were normal. She had quit smoking 20 years before and had diabetes with mild neuropathy. At a visit 4 months later, her examination was notable for an increase in size of the mass, surrounding ecchymosis, and a 2-cm ulceration on the first web of the left hand. The mass extended to the wrist flexion crease and both dorsally and volarly. No lymphadenopathy was present. X-rays showed soft tissue swelling in the thenar regions bilaterally and in the dorsum of the left hand and a diffuse permeative process involving the second left metacarpal (Figs. 1, 2  ). A magnetic resonance imaging study of the left hand showed a 5.5 × 4.0 × 6.8-cm soft tissue mass in the first web with pathologic fracture of the second metacarpal. A needle biopsy revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which was positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER), which indicated that the lymphoma cells were infected by EBV, and for CD20, a marker characteristic of B-cell lymphomas and often a therapeutic target for drugs such as rituximab. Methotrexate was stopped and a positron emission tomography (PET) was obtained (Figs. 3, 4  ). This showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake associated with the soft tissue mass in the left hand. There was also increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake associated with a soft tissue mass in the right hand. Standard uptake values for fluorodeoxyglucose were suggestive of malignancy in both hands. The remainder of the examination was normal. A magnetic resonance imaging study of the right hand showed a 5.8 × 3.1 × 2.6-cm enhancing intramuscular mass involving the deep aspect of the thenar eminence. Biopsy showed an EBER-negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Complete staging, including bone marrow biopsies with molecular studies for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, was negative for lymphoma outside the hands. The patient was begun on allopurinol and received 3 doses of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, followed by standard chemotherapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. A follow-up PET scan after 6 cycles of chemotherapy showed no evidence of lymphoma in either hand, but revealed new metabolic activity in the cecum. Plain radiographs were not obtained at the time of follow-up. To complete the lymphoma therapy, she was given external beam radiation, 3,060 cGy to each hand in 17 fractions. An adenocarcinoma of the cecum and ascending colon corresponding to the new abnormality on PET scan was found by colonoscopy. She was treated with hemicolectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IIIB colon cancer. The patient returned to her baseline hand function before the development of lymphoma. She did not require specific therapy for her hands. Because the RA remained difficult to control, she was restarted on methotrexate 2.5 years after stopping and continues to takes 15 mg weekly. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 4.7 years’ follow-up was normal, as was the PET scan 1 year after diagnosis. At 5.5 years after the initial treatment, she had no evidence of recurrent lymphoma by physical examination or laboratory studies. She did have persistently active RA involving the hands and knees bilaterally with fluctuating joint swelling, tenderness, and residual weakness. Grip strength was mildly reduced, and there was moderate atrophy of the thenar muscles in the left hand. Functionally, she was able to button shirts. "
184,S0046-8177(13)00412-7,Primary anorectal Hodgkin lymphoma: report of a case and review of the literature," 2 Case report  2.1 Clinical history An 83-year-old man presented to the Surgery Unit of Valdichiana Hospital (Siena) complaining of tenesmus and mucous bloody diarrhea that lasted for 1 month. Medical history was unremarkable. Immune suppression conditions (primary immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, and drugs) were excluded by clinical history and biochemical evaluation. HIV-1 and HIV-2 serology as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) tests were negative. EBV serology showed immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-VCA (viral capsid antigen) but not IgM, thus indicating a past infection. On digital rectal examination, a friable, hemorrhagic lesion located in the anal canal was observed. The rest of the physical examination was negative. Rectoscopy showed a 4.0 × 1.5 × 1 cm polypoid mass of the anorectal junction. The lesion was ulcerated and presented protruding margins. It extended through the entire anal canal wall, narrowing the lumen. The surrounding rectal mucosa appeared normal. A whole body computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined tumor, 40 × 15 mm, extending through the entire right wall of the anorectal junction. Neither regional and periaortic lymphadenopathy nor lesions in the liver, spleen, and lungs were detected. A mild neutrophilia (67.7%; reference range, 55.0%-64.0%) associated with decrease of lymphocytes (22.2%; reference range, 25.0%-45.0%) was observed in the blood count. The clinical differential diagnoses included localized anorectal carcinoma, isolated ulcer of the rectum, and Crohn disease. Multiple biopsies of the lesion were performed using an endoscopy cautery snare. A 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose–positron emission tomography/CT showed a 4-cm maximum diameter area of abnormally high 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in the anal canal. Surgical excision of this lesion was excluded due to the fact that it was close to nervous structures. The patient started chemotherapy with the mustargen, oncovin, procarbazine, prednisone protocol. Because of the persistence of the disease after 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the patient was considered unresponsive to medical therapy; thus, radiation treatment was planned. He received pelvic irradiation with 40 Gy with a complete disappearance of the lesion. At present (20 months after the initial diagnosis), the CT scan is negative, and the patient is well.   2.2 Materials and methods The tumor specimen was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut. The section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the following antibodies were checked on other sections: CD45, CD20, CD3, CD30, CD15, PAX5/BSAP, CD79a, IRF4/MUM1, Oct-2, Bob-1, LMP-1, EBNA2, and cytomegalovirus. In situ hybridization analysis for EBV small encoded RNA (EBER) was also performed as well as polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus.   2.3 Results The bioptic specimens consisted of 5 friable brownish fragments ranging from 1 to 4 mm. Histologically, all the fragments showed similar morphologic features: not well-circumscribed ulcerated mucosal lesions were associated with a polymorphous infiltrate invading the muscularis propria (Fig. 1A and B). At high power, the infiltrate was mainly composed by a mixture of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, immunoblasts, and scattered eosinophils. Reed-Sternberg (RS) (Fig. 1A inset) and Hodgkin cells (HC) were present in variable number. No “plasmacytoid” apoptotic cells were observed. The adjacent squamous and glandular epithelium showed reactive nuclear atypia. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD30 (Fig. 1C) and CD15 (Fig. 1D) with a paranuclear and membranous pattern of staining for LMP-1; they were negative for CD45, CD20, PAX5/BSAP, CD79a, IRF-4/MUM-1, CD3, Oct-2, Bob-1, and EBNA2 (Fig. 1E). Immunohistochemistry for cytomegalovirus was negative. In situ hybridization analysis for EBER was positive (Fig. 1F), whereas polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus was negative. The histologic, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization findings supported the diagnosis of classical HL. The biopsy performed after 4 cycles of chemotherapy showed the persistence of the disease: in the background of an ulcerative lesion with numerous inflammatory cells, granulation tissue, and epithelial regenerative changes (Fig. 2A), several CD30, CD15, LMP-1 positive RS cells, and HC were present (Fig. 2A inset). A new biopsy was carried out 3 weeks after the end of the radiotherapy. It showed a radiation proctitis characterized by mucosal ulceration, fibrosis of the lamina propria with atypical fibroblast, teleangectasia, vessels wall hyalinization, plumped endothelial cells, and numerous neutrophils and eosinophils (Fig. 2B). No CD30-positive cells were present.  "
185,S0363-5023(14)00127-0,Atypical Presentation of Isolated Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma in the Hand: Case Report," Case Report A 78-year-old, right-handed man presented with progressive and painless left hand enlargement over the course of 1 year. He denied any history of trauma or systemic symptoms such as fevers, chills, or weight loss. His only medical problems were osteoarthritis and hypothyroidism. The patient had no personal or family history of autoimmune disease. Examination revealed diffuse swelling primarily affecting the volar aspect of the hand and the proximal portions of the fingers and distal forearm (Fig. 1 ). No sensory deficits were noted in the hand. The skin was edematous, and several small blisters were present dorsally. There was no tenderness or discrete mass noted on palpation. Joints were supple, and active range of motion was limited only by swelling. The patient had no discernible lymphadenopathy on physical examination. Despite the hand deformity, the patient remained an avid piano player and was especially interested in preserving hand function. The patient had been evaluated by multiple physicians before our hand surgery consultation. Routine laboratory studies did not indicate chronic infection and did not suggest an autoimmune etiology. Radiographs of the left hand showed no osteomyelitis or other bony abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast revealed a T2 hyperintense infiltrating mass diffusely involving the soft tissues in the left palm extending from the distal forearm to the proximal phalanges. There was no definite invasion of the bone, but the flexor tendons and intrinsic muscles were clearly surrounded by the mass. Based on these findings, the differential diagnosis included rheumatoid arthritis, atypical infection, fibromatosis, infiltrative tumor, and vascular malformation. We performed an incisional diagnostic biopsy through an extended carpal tunnel incision and did not attempt to debulk the tumor. We encountered extensive inflammatory tissue resembling synovitis (Fig. 2 ). The infiltrative tumor demonstrated no respect for natural barriers. The transverse carpal ligament was attenuated and the median nerve, its recurrent thenar branches, and the superficial palmar arch were markedly displaced from their expected positions. These structures were identified and separated from the tumor. The flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus tendons were intact, although these were also surrounded by tumor. A full-thickness sample of skin and fat and several specimens of the lesion were taken for pathologic examination and cultures. Frozen section evaluation of the tumor favored lymphoma. The incision was closed and a soft dressing was applied. When the patient was seen 2 weeks later, the skin was healing without complications. Pathologic examination of the specimens revealed dense inflammatory infiltrate consisting predominantly of lymphocytes permeating through skin, muscle, adipose tissue, and synovium. Immunohistochemical stains identified the lymphocytes as T-cells expressing CD4, CD3, and CD5, with loss of CD7 (Fig. 3 ). The final diagnosis was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. All intraoperative cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth. The patient pursued oncology follow-up at another medical institution. Therefore, we ascertained the details of his postoperative course through phone interviews with the patient and his oncologists. The patient underwent a positron emission tomography study that demonstrated isolated involvement of the right hand. A bone marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy. Workup did not reveal definitive evidence of nodal involvement. Because of the patient’s lack of systemic symptoms and advanced age, the tumor board recommended a course of radiation therapy to avoid the systemic side effects of chemotherapy. Shortly after completion of radiotherapy, the patient noted a considerable reduction in the size of the hand and healing of the dorsal blisters. No immediate adverse effects from the radiation were reported. The patient stated that he was still able to play the piano. "
186,S2214-4420(17)30152-3,A case of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the bladder successfully treated with radiotherapy," Discussion Primary MALT lymphoma originating in the bladder is rare, 1  and its etiology is unclear because there is normally no lymphoid tissue in the bladder. 22–40% of primary lymphomas of the bladder are preceded by chronic cystitis, 2  as was the lymphoma in the present case. Chronic inflammation may be a precursor because in some cases there are lympho-epithelial lesions and reactive lymphoid follicles. 3   The most common presenting symptoms of bladder lymphoma are weight loss, fatigue, hematuria, dysuria, nocturia, pollakisuria, and suprapubic or abdominal pain. 3  Making a definitive diagnosis of bladder lymphoma is therefore especially difficult when the lymphoma coincides with active or recurrent cystitis because the symptoms are similar. In the present case, the patient had for 2 years been treated to no avail as having chronic cystitis. In the present case, bladder masses were detected by pelvic MRI. MALT lymphoma of the bladder frequently presents as a large sessile solitary tumor and does not typically involve the entire bladder wall, whereas urothelial carcinoma tends to be multiple and involve any part of the bladder. 4  It is difficult to distinguish MALT lymphoma from urothelial carcinoma radiologically, however, so pathological examination is needed for definitive diagnosis. 4   Treatment of bladder lymphoma depends on its clinical stage. FDG-PET and pelvic MRI are used to rule out disseminated disease. 5  Because our patient had Stage I disease (i.e., the lymphoma was confined to the bladder), she was treated with radiotherapy. Unfortunately there is no generally recommended optimal treatment of primary MALT lymphoma of the bladder. For localized lymphoma, cystectomy is also a treatment option. 5  Radiotherapy is the most appropriate treatment for organ preservation unless the patient is of reproductive age. 5   The optimal follow-up strategy for patients with MALT lymphoma of the bladder is also not clearly defined. After the radiotherapy in our case, cystoscopy was performed every 3 months and pelvic MRI was performed every 6 months. This follow-up schedule was well tolerated by the patient. Finally, MALT lymphoma of the bladder, although a rare disease, should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses when we treat patients with cystitis-like symptoms, especially those with symptoms of chronic cystitis refractory to antimicrobial therapies.

189,S2468-1245(16)30198-X,Pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with pseudo-achalasia and para-neoplastic neurological syndrome (Guillain-Barre): A case report," 2 Discussion Pseudoachalasia associated with malignancy has clinical, radiographic, and manometric features indistinguishable from primary achalasia. Because of identical clinical manifestation generated by both conditions, the exact determination of its etiology is critical for proper treatment of the underlying disease [6]. An immediate onset or rapidly progressing course of dysphagia can be characteristic of pseudoachalasia secondary to a neoplasm, encouraging imaging studies to evaluate the dysphagia [7]. Although weight loss is common to both pseudoachalasia and achalasia, the weight loss of pseudoachalasia, tends to be more fast and progressive [8]. In addition, patients with pseudoachalasia secondary to malignancy were more likely to be of older age and had more severe weight loss than patients with achalasia [9]. The etiology of the pseudoachalasia in the patient described in the current report is a classic obstructive phenomenon by tumor mass. Extrinsic mass compression on the distal esophagus is the main mechanism by which pseudoachalasia causes its symptoms, however, the esophageal myenteric plexus infiltration by malignant cells may be a contributing factor [6]. Histopathologial examination reveals identical findings; myenteric plexus infiltration by neoplastic cells, and marked depletion of ganglion cells [10]. Upper GIT endoscopy evaluates the degree of esophageal inflammation, distal stricture, and the presence of neoplastic lesion; however, endoscopic ultrasonography can better visualize the extrinsic lesions causing pseudoachalasia and helps in identification of subepithelial tumor infiltration through obtaining biopsy or cytologic brushings [6,11]. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging may also be useful in discriminating between the two disorders [12]. Mass detection or asymmetric thickening of the esophagus by CT supports the diagnosis of pseudoachalasia [13]. In barium swallow study both conditions show uniform esophageal dilation with a characteristic distal tapering or (beak-like). Lack of primary peristalsis (aperistalsis) is a characteristic finding by manometry, in addition to increased resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and incomplete or brief relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter in response to swallow in both disorders [5]. Hodgkin's lymphoma can be associated with multiple paraneoplastic neurological syndromes like multiple like subacute cortical, cerebellar degeneration (commonest), acute inflammatory demyelination polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre), CIDP, chorea and ataxia, subacute sensory neuropathy, motor neuron diseases myasthenia gravis, stiff person syndrome and brachial neuropathy and this syndromes may be the only presenting feature of the underlying disease [14,15].

191,S1579-2129(17)30182-9,Pulmonary Lymphoma. A Case Report,"A chest-abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed, which showed a soft tissue mass in the left posterior pleura, measuring 7.4×8.2cm, extending along the chest wall and muscles of the left posterior abdominal wall, infiltrating all planes and the subcutaneous cell tissue, accompanied by significant ipsilateral pleural effusion. Significant cavoportal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies were observed in the abdomen. Given these findings, a CT-guided biopsy was performed of the lesion. Results were consistent with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with a proliferation index of 70%, negative for EBV or c-myc. Bone marrow biopsy was normocellular, and HIV, HBV, HCV, and CMV serologies were negative."
192,S2213-0489(17)30069-9,Subcutaneous rituximab given to patients for other indications than CD20+ B-cell lymphoma: A monocentric study of 20 cases," 2 Methods Three situations were considered: EBV reactivation (post transplantation or not), ITP or ALL treatment. All patients received their first(s) dose(s) of R IV (375mg/m2/injection) and a switch to SC-R (1400mg/injection) was realized only if they didn’t experience grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) with IV formulation. Our rules is to provide R (IV+SC) weekly, up to 4 doses for ITP (in case of platelets counts <30 Giga/L with no response to corticosteroids or immunoglobulin) and EBV reactivation (in case of 2 positive PCR > 4 log10 number of viral DNA copies), while GRAALL schedule [4] is followed for R administration in CD20+ ALL patients. A premedication with antipyretic, antihistamine and corticosteroid was systematically administered before every infusion. Tolerance of SC-R was appreciated using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 and any grade 3 or 4 AE related to SC-R was sufficient to stop treatment. Late-onset neutropenia (LON) was defined as neutropenia developing at least three to four weeks following the end of SC-R administration despite a previous normal neutrophil count [7]. Success of SC-R was defined by either a documentation of a negative EBV PCR or absence of ALL relapse or platelets counts reaching at least 100 Giga/L. "

Her medical history was significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteopenia, thyroid nodules, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dry eyes, and dry mouth. Her medications included lisinopril, metoprolol, dofetilide, rivaroxaban, cevimeline, calcium, and multivitamins. Computed tomography (CT) scans in 2014 and 2017 had revealed marked bilateral symmetric enlargement of the submandibular glands. Extraoral examination revealed painless, firm swelling of the submandibular glands. Intraoral examination was significant for diffuse, nontender, and bilateral swelling of the mucosa of the hard palate. These tissues exhibited red-purple coloration and a boggy consistency, with no sign of bleeding or discharge. An incisional biopsy of the palatal swelling demonstrated an atypical proliferation of lymphoid cells initially deemed suspicious for marginal zone lymphoma. Concurrent systemic workup with CT demonstrated asymptomatic lesions of the pancreas and lungs, with biopsies consistent with IgG4-related disease. Immunohistochemical studies of the palatal biopsy confirmed the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells, supporting the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. The patient was treated with prednisone and achieved near complete resolution of the palatal swelling, submandibular glands, and lymph nodes."
197,S2212-5558(12)00158-5,Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the mandible: A case report," 2 Case report In January 2012, a 46-year-old male was admitted to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Mashhad Faculty of Dentistry, Iran, complaining of 1 week painful swelling in the lingual aspect of the right posterior body of mandible. There was no asymmetry of the face. His lower right third molar was extracted 4 months earlier. After nearly 1 month, the lower right second molar was also luxated and extracted. After a period of time, he noticed swelling in the lingual aspect of the posterior right mandible that started hurting with pain 1 week prior to admission. He had no history of any systemic disease. In oral examination, there was a swelling measured 3.5cm×3.5cm which was in the retromolar area of right body of the mandible. The mass expanded bucco-lingually, obliterated buccal vestibule and perforated lingual cortical plate. There was buccal expansion from the retromolar area to the edentulous area of the right lower first molar and lingual expansion from the retromolar area to the mid-portion of the edentulous right lower first molar. Overlying mucosa was smooth, normal in color with soft consistency. In imaging, periapical radiograph and OPG revealed an ill-defined radiolucency in the area of the right lower second and third molar. Proposed clinical differential diagnoses included squamous cell carcinoma and malignancy of the salivary gland. Eventually, the lesion underwent incisional biopsy. On surgical session, a solid mass was found which had caused lingual cortical plate perforation. The biopsy specimen revealed a malignant neoplastic proliferation of undifferentiated large cell with abundant cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, severe pleomorphism, hyperchromatism and multiple abnormal mitoses. There was abundant necrosis and penetration of neoplastic cells destroyed adjacent bone trabeculae (Fig. 1 ). Histological differential diagnoses included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, amelanotic melanoma, malignant odontogenic tumors, and malignancies of mesenchymal tissues like osteosarcoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was positive for LCA, CD20, and revealed a high proliferative index (Ki-67=80%) but was negative for CK, S100, HMB 45, Vimentin, and CD45RO (Fig. 2 ). All together, these findings suggested a monoclonal malignant proliferation of lymphoid cells of B-cell origin. There were no signs of the disease elsewhere in the body. Chest X-ray, ultra sound of abdomen, bone scan and bone marrow biopsy did not reveal any abnormality and confirmed the lesion to be localized. In the post-surgical CT scan of the neck area, no supra- or infra-glottic lesions and no significant lymphadenopathy were observed. There was no airway constriction or asymmetry and no bone destruction. Only post-surgical alteration in the right mandible was evident. The patient was referred to an oncologist for chemotherapy. As the patient did not keep his appointment with the dental school, no additional follow-up information is available. "

The Ki-67 proliferation index is usually high (> 80%). 4  The absence of common B-cell and T-cell markers, along with the extranodal location of these tumors, often presents a diagnostic challenge. 5  No standard recommendations regarding the optimal treatment of patients with PBL have been made because of its rarity and aggressiveness. 1,3  Commonly used regimens are lymphoma-specific multiagent systemic chemotherapy with or without consolidation radiation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 2,3,6  The poor outcome of these treatments suggests that new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Drugs used in multiple myeloma (MM) therapy, particularly bortezomib, have been observed as active agents in the management of PBL. 7-11  Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of MM and for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma treatment. The rationale for the application of a proteasome inhibitor in PBL is based on the use of a combination regimen with activity in B cells and plasma cells. Herein we report a rare case of HIV-negative gastric PBL treated with bortezomib and thalidomide combined with CHOP, which showed a remarkable and early therapeutic response. "

A total of 6 cases were identified. One case (case 4) has been reported previously [6]. Clinical data for each patient were retrieved from the electronic medical record.   2.2 Histologic and immunophenotypic assessment Hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides and immunohistochemical studies were reviewed for all cases. Immunohistochemical slides were prepared at the submitting institution or in our own laboratory as described previously [7]. Monoclonal antibodies used included reagents specific for CD2, CD10, BCL-2 (clone 100/D5) (Leica/Novocastra, Buffalo Grove, IL); CD3, CD20, CD21, CD23, CD79a, BCL-6, and Ki-67 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA); CD5 (Thermo Fisher, Fremont, CA); and BCL-2 (clone E17, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Flow cytometry immunophenotypic studies were performed in 5 cases (3 lymph node samples, 2 bone marrow aspirates), and conventional cytogenetic study was performed on 1 case at our institution using methods described previously [7]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 2 lymph node samples using fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections and on 1 bone marrow aspirate smear using methods described previously [7,8].   2.3 Review of the literature An electronic search was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information/National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health Web site PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), using the phrases follicular lymphoma and hyaline-vascular Castleman disease, follicular lymphoma with Castleman features, variant follicular lymphoma and Castleman-like features, and follicular lymphoma Castleman-like.

She had been on azathioprine treatment 175?mg once per day for 8?years. There were no focal neurological deficits on examination. MRI brain demonstrated a left posterior fossa rim enhancing lesion, measuring 27?×?21?×?20?mm, appearing to originate from the dura, although there was no dural tail and the enhancement of the lesion was irregular (Fig. 1 ). CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any extra-cranial lesions. The differential diagnosis included a dural based metastasis and less likely a meningioma. She underwent a stereotactic left retrosigmoid craniotomy and resection of the lesion. At surgery the lesion was separate from the dura and was easily dissected off this. It was resected in a piecemeal fashion. The procedure was uncomplicated and the patient made a good postoperative recovery before being discharged with azathioprine and pyridostigmine. When the diagnosis was confirmed, azathioprine was discontinued but pyridostigmine was continued. Unfortunately the patient developed a recurrent lesion at the site of resection 5?weeks postoperatively. She was treated with rituximab and methotrexate followed by cytarabine. At six months postoperatively the patient has minor residual fatigue, but no headache and no neurological deficits.   2.2 Pathologic findings Microscopic examination revealed a largely necrotic tumour with sheets of pleomorphic cells associated with many small lymphocytes. Mitoses were prominent (Fig. 2 A). Large lymphocytes were seen with irregular nuclear margins, with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 2B) and in association with thrombosed medium sized blood vessels (Fig. 2C). The lymphocytes were EBER positive (Fig. 2D) and large transformed lymphocytes were positive for CD20 (Fig. 2C and E) MUM-1 (Fig. 2F), CD79a, BCL2 and p53. High Ki-67 index. TdT and Cyclin D1 were negative. The IGH gene rearrangement assay (performed on extracted tumour DNA) demonstrated a discrete monoclonal peak against a polyclonal background. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings were of an immunodeficiency associated primary CNS EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  "

To the best of our knowledge, no prospective randomized controlled trials have assessed the optimum treatment of NLPHL. Consequently, information has been gained mainly from a modest number of retrospective reviews. 2-9  Some larger classic Hodgkin lymphoma studies have included NLPHL patients; however, the subset analyses have not been powered enough to produce reliable data on the outcomes. 1   "
207,S1040-8428(13)00119-4,Endometrial marginal zone B-cell MALT-type lymphoma: Case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 55 year-old postmenopausal woman presented at our Institution with abnormal uterine bleeding. Gynaecological examination revealed a normal uterus and there was no suspicion for infections or malignancy. Pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound scans showed an endometrial polyp, measuring 1.5cm in diameter and a slightly thickened endometrium. Operative hysteroscopy was performed with polypectomy and endometrial biopsies. Histology revealed a dense lymphoid infiltrate both in the endometrial and polyp stroma that was suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Biopsy of both iliac crest bones was negative for lymphoma. Routine peripheral blood findings were normal. Computed tomography staging scans of the pelvis revealed no lymph nodes enlargement in the chest and abdomen. The pathological staging, according to the modified Ann Arbour staging system for extranodal lymphoma, was stage IE. The patient underwent to laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymph node sampling. The uterus measured 8cm×3.5cm×3cm. On sectioning, the endometrial cavity was devoid of tumoral mass. The cervix and the ovaries were unremarkable. Microscopically, lymphomatous deposits were observed in the endometrium and superficial myometrium. The infiltrate showed an ill-defined nodular pattern, spared the glands and was composed of a relatively monotonous population of small-sized, monocytoid-like lymphocytes, with scant clear cytoplasm and round nuclei with fine chromatin. No germinal centres and no plasmacytoid differentiation were noted. Mitoses were scarce (Fig. 1 a and b). Immunohistochemical studies were performed on deparaffinized sections using an indirect biotin–avidin method. The lymphoid population expressed the B-cell markers CD20 (Fig. 2 a) and CD79a. Diffuse positivity for CD5 and Bcl-2 protein was also observed (Fig. 2b and c, respectively). Few CD3 T-cells and bcl-6-positive lymphocytes were scattered among the lymphomatous growth. No positive reaction for CD10, cyclin D1, CD43, CD138 was observed in the tumour mass. CD23 highlighted a few residual reactive follicles in the endometrium. IRTA1 (immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation associated 1), a B-cell surface receptor that identifies normal and neoplastic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B-cells, and kappa/lambda chain staining gave equivocal results. A low proliferative rate (<10% of the neoplastic cells) was demonstrated by staining with Ki-67. Bcl-2 protein also stained the endometrial glands, while the endometrial stromal cells, as expected, reacted with CD10. A conclusive diagnosis of peripheral B-cell lymphoma, consistent with a marginal zone (MALT-type) origin was made. As the tumour was staged low risk, no further treatment was deemed necessary. Clinical and instrumental subsequent controls did not reveal recurrence of the disease after 30 months of follow-up. "
209,S1748-6815(13)00523-8,Anaplastic large cell lymphoma in a reconstructed breast using a silicone implant: A UK case report," Patient A 55 year old patient with a previous history of bilateral oophorectomy underwent bilateral risk reducing mastectomies in July 2008 due to a strongly positive family history of ovarian and breast cancer. Bilateral round, textured silicone implant expanders were used at the time (Allergan Style 150 short height 625–655 ml). She developed bilateral capsular contractures which were treated in January 2009 with capsulectomies and exchange of the implants (Allergan Style 150 short height 625–655 ml). At that time there were no concerns with the capsules or abnormal intraoperative findings. She represented to the department in the first half of 2012 with a slightly enlarged left breast. It was initially agreed to remove the implants and use bilateral autologous latissimus dorsi flaps. On the day of the operation however, the breast size and shape were acceptable and the patient did not wish to proceed with the reconstruction. The left breast was explored as it was slightly enlarged and the port was no longer palpable. Approximately 100 ml of milky, thickened fluid was encountered and this was sent for cytological analysis. The implant had no discernible abnormalities and a grade 1 capsule so the implant was left in situ. A diagnosis of ALK negative, CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma was made on cytology and an urgent referral made to the haematology department. Staging CT was negative. PET CT showed increased uptake in an area confined to the left breast capsule and no other areas of disease (Figure 1 ). The patient went on to have a left, unilateral capsulectomy and bilateral implant removal. After MDT discussion and wider consultation, it was decided to adopt a conservative approach with clinical follow up and a repeat PET CT scan rather than commence chemo- or radiotherapy. Follow up PET CT scans post-surgery showed no residual or other disease and she remains in remission 12 months after her initial surgery. The diagnosis of breast implant associated ALCL has been reported to the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is responsible for medical devices in the UK. "
210,S2210-2612(17)30359-0,What’s new on primary Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the breast? A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 79-year-old woman was referred to our unit with a single palpable painless mass in the superior outer quadrant of the right breast and many palpable lymph nodes in the right axilla. The patient said that at the beginning she had noticed a little asymptomatic lump which rapidly increased in terms of dimensions in only 2 months. A mammogram was performed and showed a 2,5cm single mass with well defined contour at the junction between the superior outer quadrant and the axillary tail of the right breast (Fig. 1 ). Lesion size was calculated by measuring the maximum diameter on the mammogram. An ultrasonography was then performed in order to study both the breast lump and the axillary involvement. This procedure confirmed a grossly involvement of the lymph nodes of the right axilla that were confluent in consistent lumps wrapped around the axillary vein. For what concerned the breast mass, the ultrasound findings showed a homogeneously hypoecoic lump with an oval shape and well-defined margins, no vascularity was seen at Color Doppler (Fig. 2 ). The patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) but the pathology report was not significant. Therefore, we decided to proceed with a lumpectomy, in order to better asses the nature of the tumor. Microscopic examination in hematoxylin and eosin sections showed nodules of polymorphous inflammatory cells surrounded by broad fibrous bands extending from a thick capsule. The cellular nodules contained small lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and scattered Reed-Sternberg cells with lacunar features. In some fields Reed-Sternberg cells formed aggregates. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue. Reed-Sternberg cells were negative for CD20 and showed intense positivity for CD15 with a membranous staining pattern and slightly positivity for CD30 with a dot-like staining pattern. A diagnosis of nodular sclerosis variant of classical Hodgkin disease with syncytial features was rendered (Fig. 3 ). The patient was then referred to the Oncology Department, where the neoplasm was staged as level II A\E (right breast primary with ipsilateral axillary nodal involvement). The patient underwent systemic treatment with chemotherapy, consisting in a 50% reduced ABVD (Doxorubicin, Bleomicyn, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) scheme. We observed a complete response to the treatment and the patient was relapse-free after one year follow-up. "
212,S1110-0362(13)00064-2,Gastric diffuse large B cell lymphoma presenting as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration: Case report and review of literature," Case history A 68-year-old male presented with a two month history of progressive unsteadiness while walking, tendency to fall to either side, and slurred speech. He had lost about 5kg of weight in the last 2months. This was followed by altered behaviour with fearfulness and talking to self for last four days. Patient had progressive difficulty in walking due to gait ataxia and postural instability and required support for ambulation. There were no other systemic or neurological symptoms during this period. There was no significant past medical history. Examination revealed titubation, upbeat nystagmus, truncal and gait ataxia, bilateral limb ataxia, normal sensory examination, brisk deep tendon reflexes and flexor plantar response. He was noted to have fluctuating sensorium, with multifocal rest and action induced myoclonus of limbs and facial muscles. He developed significant worsening of behavioural disturbances during evaluation in hospital with visual hallucinations, and disturbed sleep. He was evaluated for subacute onset pan-cerebellar syndrome with encephalopathy; the differential diagnoses considered included paraneoplastic or non-paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalopathy, neurosyphilis, intracranial space occupying lesion, and Creuzfeldt Jakob disease. Investigations for the same were carried out. Routine investigations including haemogram, renal and hepatic function tests, serum electrolytes, serum ammonia (27.8; ref: 11–35?mol/l) and lactate (12.7; ref: 4.5–20mg/dl) were normal. Thyroid function tests were normal [T3: 83.8, (ref: 71–178ng/dl); T4: 8.42, (ref: 4.5–12.5?g/dl); TSH: 1.17, (ref: 0.4–5.5?IU/ml)], anti thyroid peroxidase antibody was borderline (35.9; ref: upto 34IU/ml), and serum sample was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were unremarkable. Routine analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 10 cells (9 lymphocytes, 1 polymorph), normal protein and glucose. Repeated CSF cytospin failed to yield any neoplastic cells. Since the above investigations did not provide a clue to the diagnosis, he was evaluated further for possible paraneoplastic aetiology in view of rapidly progressing symptoms. Stool occult blood was positive, while serological markers for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration including anti-Yo, anti-Hu, anti-Tr, anti-Ma and anti-Ri antibodies were all negative. Antibodies for autoimmune encephalopathy like N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and LGI-1 were not tested. Whole body positron emission tomography (PET)–computed tomography (CT) scan performed using 10 mCi of intravenous fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed a 2.3×1.8cm metabolically active focal mural thickening of the gastric fundus and two small pulmonary nodules in the left lower lobe and the right middle lobe measuring 4 and 3mm in diameter, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an elevated lesion with surface ulceration in the gastric fundus (Fig. 2 A). Histopathology of the lesion showed gastric mucosa effaced with sheets of large mononuclear lymphoid cells with scant cytoplasm and vesiculated nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The cells were CD20 positive, cytokeratin (CK) negative, and CD3 negative, suggestive of DLBCL of the stomach (Fig. 2B and C). Colonoscopy and bone marrow aspiration were non-contributory. A diagnosis of gastric DLBCL stage IV (pulmonary metastases) with an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 4/5 and PCD and limbic encephalopathy was thus made. He initially received intravenous methyl prednisolone (1g daily for 5days) for PND. There was a significant improvement in encephalopathy (although cerebellar features persisted) and he was referred for management of DLBCL. He subsequently received combination chemotherapy for gastric DLBCL with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Interim assessment of the disease status at the end of three cycles showed partial response. Major resolution of neurological symptoms was observed after the 3rd cycle of chemotherapy and maximum improvement was seen two weeks after the completion of 6 cycles of R-CHOP. The patient developed syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) after second cycle of R-CHOP which was successfully managed according to institutional protocol. He was also treated with six courses of intrathecal methotrexate, hydrocortisone and cytarabine. At 8month follow-up, the gastric lesion was in complete remission and there was a significant improvement in cerebellar signs. He is currently on regular follow up. "
215,S2210-2612(14)00129-1,Co-occurrence of papillary thyroid cancer and MALT lymphoma of the thyroid with severe airway obstruction: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Presentation of case A 58-year-old woman was referred to our department because of progressive enlargement of the thyroid gland. She had a history of ovarian cancer which has not showed recurrence after surgery. Enlargement of the thyroid gland had been noticed when the patient was a teenager, but this had been treated conservatively. In March 2013, the patient noticed an progressive enlargement of the neck mass and was referred to our department. She did not report a change in speech, shortness of breath, or weight loss at that time. Upon physical examination, her thyroid gland was enlarged, with the left lobe being larger than the right. There were no palpable cervical lymph nodes. Other findings of the physical examination were unremarkable. Laboratory examination indicated normal thyroid function, although the serum thyroglobulin antibody level was slightly elevated. Levels of serum markers for leukemia, such as beta-2 microglobulin and sIL-2R, were also normal. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous thyroid gland. In particular, 2 discrete hypoechoic nodules were detected: one in the left lobe, measuring 47.3mm×36.4mm×51.2mm, and the other in the right lobe, measuring 7.4mm×7.8mm×9.9mm, with speckled calcification. Both nodules were subsequently examined by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. The left nodule showed a predominance of lymphoid cells, associated with rare scattering of atypical cells. These lymphoid cells comprised a relatively uniform sample of intermediate-sized plasmacytoid lymphocytes/plasma cells, which suggested the possibility of a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder. However, because of insufficient material for additional tests such as flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, a definitive diagnosis could not be made. The aspirate from the right nodule was distinctively different from that taken from the left nodule. The sample extracted from the right nodule contained epithelial cells arranged in syncytial groups and microfollicles. Nuclei were enlarged, oval, and overlapping. Diagnostic nuclear features of PTC were observed, such as pale, powdery chromatin; nuclear grooves; small nucleoli; and intranuclear inclusions. The patient was scheduled to undergo further investigation, but after 1 week, she returned to the emergency room with shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing. Upon physical examination, her thyroid had significantly increased in size since her last visit. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed progressive enlargement of the left lobe, which had caused severe compression of the trachea (Fig. 1 ). Because of rapid enlargement of the thyroid, which resulted in severe trachea compression, surgical resection was inevitable. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy were not viable options in this case, given the requirement of an immediate response. We performed emergency total thyroidectomy and lymph node adenectomy under general anesthesia. The right recurrent nerve was preserved, but the left recurrent nerve had to be resected because of severe adhesion to the left lobe of the thyroid. There was no invasion into the esophagus or trachea, and tumor resection was possible. Histological examination of the right lobe showed a predominant follicular pattern in the PTC (Fig. 2A). The tumor measured 10mm×8.0mm, and no extrathyroidal extension or lymph node involvement was noted. Histopathological examination in the left lobe indicated extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type with extreme plasmacytic differentiation (Fig. 2B). Scattered reactive germinal centers were also observed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed, and the plasmacytic cells showed dominant expression of CD20+ (B cell marker) rather than of CD3+ (T cell marker) (Fig. 2C) and of the kappa light chain rather than that of the lambda light chain. The test for BCL-2 gene mutation was negative. The postoperative course was good, and the patient did not show any further symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty in swallowing. The function of the right vocal cord remained intact and required no intervention by postoperative laryngoscopy. She was discharged 10 days after surgery. One month later, positron emission tomography-CT did not reveal any abnormal accumulation and showed no evidence of recurrence of the lymphoma. The patient continues to be monitored, without the administration of chemotherapy or radiation. "

Two months later he presented in a hospital with umbilical abdominal pain, cough, pallor, vomiting, fever and pancytopenia. Physical examination, CT scans showed splenomegaly and chest X-ray a left hilar infiltration diarrhea (data not shown). His initial complete blood picture revealed white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.6×109/l with 64% lymphocytes, red blood cells (RBC) 3.2×106/mm3, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 8.3g/dl, and platelet (Plt) count of 51×109/l. Bone marrow aspiration showed hypercellularity (50%) and spots of myelofibrosis. Biochemist analyses identified a serum LDH value of 273U/l (normal value up to 240U/l), serum alkaline phosphatase level of 131U/l (normal level up to 128U/l), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 13U/l (normal up to 45U/l), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 17U/l (normal up to 45U/l). Total serum protein was 3.7g/dl (normal value 6.4–8.3g/dl), calcium value 7.4mg/dl (normal 8.5–10.5mg/dl), phosphor value 2.1mg/dl (normal 2.7–4.5mg/dl), and Ferritin value of 421.4 (18.2–341.2ng/ml). The patient did not receive any treatment before the cytogenetics test was done at this time point. Two months later the patient, depending of the patient's age and due to political situation in his home country he received six cycles of available drugs such as Seliciclib, Vincristine, and Prednisone. He developed a significant hematologic toxicity during the 2rd cycle including pancytopenia and neutropenia. He still revealed pancytopenia at the end of the 5month treatment. His oldest son agreed with scientific evaluation of his father case and the study was approved by the ethical committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.   2.2 Chromosome analysis Chromosome analysis using GTG-banding according to standard procedures (Al-achkar et al., 2007) was performed before the treatment started. 20 metaphase cells derived from unstimulated bone marrow culture were analyzed. Karyotype was described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN 2013) (Shaffer et al., 2013).   2.3 Molecular cytogenetics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using different probes: commercially available ones were whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes for chromosomes 1, 3, 9, 13 and 14 (MetaSystems, Altlussheim, Germany), a subtelomeric probe for 14qter (Vysis, USA), and centromeric probes (CEP) for 1/5/19, 3 and 13/21 (Kreatech/Leica, The Netherlands). Homemade WCPs probes for chromosomes 3, 13 and 14, partial chromosome painting probes for 9q12, and 1q12, and locus-specific probes RP11-35B4 in 1q21, RP11-702H21 in 1p12, RP11-91A15 in 3p12, RP11-128P23 in 9p12 and RP11-430C15 in 9q13. Besides array-proven multicolor banding (aMCB) probe sets for chromosomes 1, 3, 9, 13 and 14 were applied. FISH was done following standard procedures (Al-achkar et al., 2007; Liehr et al., 2002). A minimum of 10 metaphase spreads was analyzed, using a fluorescence microscope (AxioImager.Z1 mot, Carl Zeiss Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) equipped with appropriate filter sets to discriminate between a maximum of five fluorochromes plus the counterstain DAPI (4?,6-diamino-2-phenylindole). Image capture and processing were performed using an ISIS imaging system (MetaSystems).   2.4 Flow cytometric immunophenotype Immunophenotyping was done using a panel of fluorescent-labeled antibodies against the following antigens typical for different cell lineages and cell types: CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD10, CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD32, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD41a, CD45, CD56, CD57, CD64, CD103, CD117, CD123, CD138, CD209, CD235a and CD243; in addition antibodies to Kappa and Lambda light Chains, IgD, sIgM, and HLADr were tested. All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Samples were analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer. Autofluorescence, viability, and isotype controls were included. Flow cytometric data acquisition and analysis were conducted by BD Cellquest™ Pro software.  "
217,S2213-0071(14)00026-4,T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma presenting with pleural effusion: A case report," Case report An 18-year-young man was admitted to our department with cough and shortness of breath. One month before admission his referral, he presented with cough, shortness of breath and fever, and also experienced chest pain after rough cough. The highest temperature of the patient was 37.5 °C. He denied purulent sputum, hemoptysis and arthronalgia. Unfortunately, the cough and shortness of breath of the patient had progressively worsened over time. Chest examination revealed absent breath sounds on the lower two thirds of the left hemithorax and a dull percussion note. No detectable peripheral lymphadenopathy was found. Laboratory results included normal creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum electrolyte; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 179 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 30U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 25 U/L; total protein (TP), 66.3 g/L; leukocyte count, 10.3 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 16.7 g/dl; platelet count, 233 × 109/L. A peripheral blood smear examination revealed no abnormal lymphoid cells. Serum test results were negative for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma associated antigen (SCC), hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Schaudinn's bacillus. We did not carry out human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) test in our center. Also serum test showed erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 8 mm/h; and C-reactive protein (CRP), 43.6 mg/L. Sputum cultures were negative for bacteria, fungus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chest X-ray demonstrates a large anterior mediastinal mass and a left pleural effusion with a light contralateral shift of the trachea and mediastinum (Fig. 1 ). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed an anterior and middle mediastinal mass with a light contralateral shift of the trachea, pleural thickening of the left hemithorax, and left-sided pleural effusion (Fig. 2 ). Chest ultrasonography revealed massive left pleural effusion. Echocardiography showed little pericardial effusion. And ultrasonography of superficial lymph node showed lymphadenopathy in bilateral axillary region (left 21.1 × 11.4 mm; right 15.4 × 4.4 mm), bilateral cervical region, (left, 18.7 × 17.1 mm; right 12 × 5.2 mm), and bilateral inguinal region (left 16 × 4.8 mm; right 11.3 × 9.3 mm), but not in retroperitoneal region. Thoracentesis were performed and revealed exudate with lactate dehydrogenase level of 721 U/L, ADA value of 25 U/L, and TP 15.3 g/L. Pleural fluid were grossly bloody and the routine examination of pleural fluid showed leukocytes 5 × 109/L (55% percent multinucleated cells, 54% percent mononuclear cells). The cytologic examination of the effusion smears revealed massive lymphocytes, a small amount of mesothelial cells, and partly abnormal cells (tumor cell?). Pleural fluid cultures were negative for M. tuberculosis. Then the medical thoracoscopy was performed under local anesthesia, cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring, in the endoscopy suite by experienced operator. The inspection of the pleural by a direct vision optic revealed massive bloody pleural fluid in the pleural cavity, and widely membrane hyperemia with lots of small white apophysis involving the parietal pleura (Fig. 3 ). Specimens from the parietal pleural were picked ten times in different area by biopsy forceps. Pleural biopsies showed diffuse, partially nodular, infiltration by neoplastic lymphocytes. The immunohistochemical analysis of lymphoma cells showed CD20 (?), CD3 (+), CD21 (residual FDC+), Ki67 (30%+), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT, +), CD99(+), which was consistent with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (Fig. 4 ). In addition, bone marrow aspirate showed no malignant involvement. Lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions was suspected to have relevance to nodal metastasis of lymphoblastic lymphoma. Unfortunately, the patient gave up treatment and discharged due to the financial difficulties. He had a very aggressive course of disease and died only 6 months after diagnosis. "
219,S1607-551X(13)00123-X,Hodgkin's lymphoma-related vanishing bile duct syndrome: A case report and literature review," Case report A 38-year-old man was admitted to our ward with complaints of abdominal pain and jaundice for 1 week. Past history showed that he had dyslipidemia and depressive disorder and had been under Bupropion treatment. The associated symptoms and signs included nausea sensation, watery diarrhea, and fever. He had consumed some alcohol over recent days, and had travelled to China and Japan recently. He denied receiving blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, or exposure to drugs or viral hepatitis. Physical examination showed icteric sclera, right neck lymph node swelling, and mild upper abdomen tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed bilirubin (total/direct), 14.8/9.39 mg/dL; alanine transaminase (ALT), 181 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 53 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase, 155 IU/L; and gamma-glutamyl transferase, 317 IU/L. The hemogram was normal. The virology tests were negative for hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus. Immunology tests revealed normal levels of ?2-microglobulin, complement component 3 (C3), complement component 4 (C4), and immunoglobulin, and the test was negative for antinuclear antibody. Ceruloplasmin level was normal. Neck computed tomography (CT) scan showed enlarged lymph nodes over the right jugulodigastric, posterior cervical, and supraclavicular areas. Abdominal CT scan revealed normal intrahepatic biliary duct and unremarkable intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan revealed involvement of cervical regions, mediastinum, and bilateral axillary basins. Suspicious spleen and bone marrow involvement were also noted. Neck lymph node biopsy was performed, and the pathology revealed classical HL with mixed cellular subtype. Bone marrow biopsy was found negative for lymphoma involvement. Due to persistent jaundice, a liver biopsy was carried out; the pathology showed cholestasis with absent or focally decreased numbers of bile ductules in the portal tract areas in the whole specimen (Fig. 1 A and C) rather than proliferative ones and no Hodgkin cell was identified, which addressed the possibility of HL-related VBDS. After diagnosis of HL Stage IIA, the patient was treated with standard adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) regimen chemotherapy biweekly. The dosage of chemotherapy was adjusted according to the reference for Truven Heath Analytics Micromedex version 1.0 (Healthcare Series) due to hepatic insufficiency. A total of eight courses (4 cycles) of ABVD chemotherapy were given over 28 weeks. The patient's total bilirubin level returned to nearly normal on Week 28 (Fig. 2 ). Liver biopsy repeated on Week 36 revealed regeneration of interlobular bile ducts (Fig 1B and D). Three months after chemotherapy had been completed, the patient received peripheral blood stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide 4 g/m2 followed by peripheral blood stem cell harvest. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation with BEAM (Bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU), etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, and melphalan) conditioning regimen was carried out 3 months after peripheral blood stem cell harvest. Total nuclear cell count 6.42 × 108/kg and CD34 count 1.67 × 106/kg body weight were administered during the autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Full engraftment was reached on Day 19 after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. The patient has maintained remission state up to the time of writing (more than 7 months) and is regularly followed up at our outpatient service. "
220,S1278-3218(13)00442-3,Helical tomotherapy in oncodermatology: Case report of circumferential cutaneous lymphoma treated by this optimized radiotherapy," 2 Case presentation A 61-year-old woman presented on the right side of the trunk a large (17×38cm) and half circumferential cutaneous lesion with ulceration, thickly budding and easily bleeding, which had been evolving slowly for 2 years. The histological analysis revealed an epidermotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma CD30?, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ with a T clone found by DNA PCR (TCR rearrangement), evocative of a transformed mycosis fungoide. A PET scan revealed hypermetabolic axillary and inguinal lymph nodes whose histological analysis revealed a lymphoma with the same phenotype. Because of systemic involvement, the patient received a classical multi-agent chemotherapy: 5 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, prednisone), then 2 cycles of DHAP (dexamethasone, carboplatin, cytarabine) and finally 2 cycles of bendamustine. A complete lymph node response was observed after these 3 therapies, while the cutaneous lesion persisted. Localized external radiotherapy was then proposed in order to control the local extension. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by helical tomotherapy with 6MV photons was realized. The patient received a total of 35Gy in 14 fractions (Fig. 1 ). A response was observed after only 1 month with a size reduction of the initial lesion superior to 80%, with epithelialization. All organs at risk were spared, as shown in Fig. 1. After evaluation, a boost of 8Gy in 4 fractions by electrons therapy (9MV) was delivered to the residual disease in order to sterilize the tumour (superficial treatment). Three months after the end of radiotherapy, the tumorous lesion totally decreased leaving a scar aspect and few superficial postradiotherapy erosions (Fig. 2 ). Autologous stem cell transplantation is scheduled to consolidate this response. "
221,S1748-6815(13)00256-8,Breast implant associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma: A case report and reconstructive option," Case report The patient was a 34-year-old woman who underwent bilateral breast augmentation in 2008, with 275 g Allergan Inspira (Allergan Inc, California, USA) silicone textured round implants. There were no intra-operative complications and an uneventful postoperative period. Two years later, in 2010, she presented with right-sided seroma, resolving several weeks later with conservative management. She presented again in 2011 with recurrence of the right-sided seroma and returned to theatre twice for revision of implants. In November 2011 the patient underwent an exchange of implants. Replacement implants were also Allergan Inspira textured silicone implants. The patient re-presented on several occasions with right breast seroma and was treated with multiple aspirations. In August 2012 the patient was referred to the current author with a further seroma (Figure 1 ). Her right breast seroma was aspirated and the fluid sent for cytology, identifying right breast implant associated ALCL. On September 10, 2012 the patient was treated with removal of implants, bilateral capsulectomy and replacement of implants with 300 g Allergan Inspira smooth round implants (Figure 2 ). Intra-operatively the large serous fluid collection was drained and capsulectomy performed. The right breast capsule was irregular and thickened throughout but no obvious mass was identified. Final histology demonstrated excised right breast capsule showing evidence of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma with neoplastic cells confined to the fibrous lining and a band like infiltrate on the inner most part of the capsule, with no discrete tumour mass (Figure 3 ). Subsequent immunohistochemistry for ALK1 was negative. The left breast capsule showed no evidence of malignancy. The patient received 36Gy in 20 fractions of neo-adjuvant radiotherapy. No cytotoxic chemotherapy was prescribed. At the time of writing, 4 months post capsulectomy and exchange of implants, both breasts had healed with no evidence of seroma recurrence and an excellent aesthetic result. The patient had finished radiotherapy uneventfully. Her follow up is ongoing. "
222,S2212-5558(17)30052-2,A case of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma of the cheek," 2 Case summary The patient was a 19-year-old male who first visited our department with a chief complaint of swelling in the left cheek. The patient had a history of atopic dermatitis. The patient's current condition began 5 months before the first visit, when he reported becoming aware of some swelling in the left facial area. The patient was examined in the Departments of Otolaryngology, Plastic Surgery, Neurosurgery and Dermatology over the 5-month period, but the cause of the swelling remained unknown. No change in symptoms was observed for 5 months. Originally misdiagnosed as a scar caused by accidentally biting the buccal mucosa when first presenting to the Department of Dermatology, the patient was eventually referred to our department upon request for resection. At that time, the patient's body temperature was 37.7°C, and he reported mild fatigue. Extraoral findings showed asymmetry in facial appearance with a high degree of diffuse swelling extending from the left cheek to the eye socket. Although there was no redness, the skin in that area was elastic, tender; and warm to the touch. In addition, there was no movement disorder or paraesthesia of the facial muscles. The distance measured between the oral mucosa and skin of the cheek in the swelled region was 20mm, whereas the distance of the same region on the opposite side was 7mm (Fig. 1A). The submandibular and cervical lymph nodes were not enlarged. Intraoral findings showed a mouth opening capacity of 60mm with no disturbance in mouth opening. No swelling or redness was observed in the left cheek mucosa, and saliva outflow from the left parotid papilla was normal (Fig. 1B). Other intraoral observations showed no pathological findings or tooth infections. Hematological findings showed a reduced WBC count of 2400cells/?L and decreased liver function (AST level, 74U/L; ALT level, 64U/L; and LDH level, 387U/L) (Table 1 ). Panoramic X-ray showed an increased shadow throughout the left maxillary sinus. No other abnormal findings were observed. As shown by MRI in Fig. 2A and B, the subcutaneous fat layer of the left buccal region had a low signal in the T1-weighted image and a markedly high diffuse signal in the T2-weighted image. Clinical findings suggested swelling of the subcutaneous tissue spreading from the cheek to the surrounding area. The findings of MRI showed significant thickening, and increased fat tissue were the main reasons for the swelling. Because no skin or dental infection was observed, panniculitis was suspected. A clinical diagnosis of suspected Weber–Christian disease was made. "

Suggestions from a case report," Case report A 27-year-old man was referred to our center for low back pain and legs paresthesia for about one month. The patient had a history of lymphoid hyperplasia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Splenectomy was performed at the age of 15. Thrombocytopenia disappeared at the age of 21. Since he displayed defective Fas function and expansion of double-negative (CD4?/CD8?) T cells (2–4% of total lymphocytes), a Canale–Smith syndrome was diagnosed. He never displayed signs of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. No mutation was found on Fas, Caspase 10 and Fas-L genes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lower trait of the dorsal spine and all lumbar vertebrae showed enhancing lesions involving L1 vertebra with heterogeneous low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, with the involvement of correspondent nervous roots and extension of pathological tissue in the correspondent paravertebral space. The spinal canal was not invaded by pathological tissue (Fig. 1 ). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a focal and subtle cortical erosion of the vertebra adjacent to the paravertebral tissue, few pulmonary nodules and diffuse enlargement of latero-cervical lymph nodes. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed hepatomegaly. Blood values showed increased fibrinogen (601mg/dL), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (?-GT) (111U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (540U/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (15.8mg/L). A bone marrow biopsy, made on L1 vertebra, showed an increased population of granulocytes. A 18F-FDG-PET/CT scan was required in order to metabolically characterize the vertebral, lung lesions and the latero-cervical lymph nodes and to complete the staging. PET/CT was acquired using an integrated PET/CT device (Discovery ST-E, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with the patient fasting for 6h; at the time of the radiopharmaceutical injection, the patient presented glucose blood levels corresponding to 87mg/dL. Images were acquired one hour after intravenous injection of 248MBq of FDG according to the body mass index. The unenhanced CT scan was performed from the skull base to the inguinal region with a voltage of 120KeV and tube current of 30mA for the anatomic localization and the attenuation correction of PET data. PET scan was acquired in 3D mode (multiple bed positions, 3min for each bed position). Iterative reconstruction and CT-based attenuation correction were used. Visual and semi-quantitative image analysis using standardized uptake value (SUV) was performed. The analysis of PET images showed multiple areas of intense 18F-FDG uptake corresponding to multiple vertebrae, some ribs, the sacrum, the liver and both lungs. Further areas of increased 18F-FDG uptake were detected in multiple lymph nodes in the cervical, thoracic and abdominal stations (Fig. 2 ). By using the PET/CT as a guide, a second bone marrow biopsy was performed on the left iliac bone, leading to the definitive diagnosis. The histopathological analysis showed a population of cells consistent with granulocytic hyperplasia. The immunological analysis showed a “lymphomatoid granulomatosis”, a rare variant of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, mostly associated with EBV infection and possibly secondary to immunological disorders. Using more recent diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of undefined autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease (ALPS-U) can be made. 4   In order to treat the B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the patient underwent six cycles of Rituximab resulting in a partial reduction of the multiple lesions. In addition, autologous EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTL) were expanded, and at the end of the sixth Rituximab course the patient received two infusions of autologous EBV-CTL (2×106 cells/kg body weight) 15 days apart, followed by a consolidation dose of 1×106 cells/kg body weight, in order to obtain complete remission. He was put under treatment with Interferon. The following bone marrow biopsy of the iliac bone resulted negative. The subsequent MRI showed a significant reduction of the paravertebral mass lesion in L1 and a regression of the vertebral lumbar oedema except for a small remnant area of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 3 ). On the contrary, the 18F-FDG-PET/CT post-treatment scan showed a positive response to the treatment, with a complete regression of all areas of 18F-FDG uptake (Fig. 4 ). Nine months later, in the follow-up, 18F-FDG-PET/CT scan confirmed the complete regression of disease. "

He arrived at our institution with a 3-week history of dysphagia and dysphonia but lacking fever, diaphoresis, and weight loss. Lactic dehydrogenase levels were elevated, whereas the rest of the blood test appeared normal. A thoracic computed tomographic (CT) scan showed supraclavicular, retrosternal, mediastinal, and paratracheal adenopathies, whereas the abdominal CT scan revealed a 14-cm splenomegaly. The cervical lymph node biopsy showed an ALK+ LBCL. The bone marrow biopsy showed no involvement. The Ann Arbor stage was IIIAS, with a low-intermediate International Prognostic Index risk. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide and prednisone and HyperCVAD (methotrexate, 2 g/m2) as second-line treatment. At this point, the lymphoma had progressed with new adenopathies, an 18-cm splenomegaly and severe opioid-resistant pain. A splenectomy was performed, and 3 cycles of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide were implemented as rescue therapy. The patient was lost after 238 days of follow-up. "

She had been infected with hepatitis C virus. There was no evidence of underlying immunodeficiency. Radiologic examination revealed a mass in the ileum, which was surgically resected. Histopathologic examination of the resected tumor revealed EBV+ CTL (tumor 1). The patient received chemotherapy with anthracycline and achieved complete remission. Fourteen years later, she returned to our hospital with hypersensitivity to mosquito bites. The load of EBV genome in her peripheral blood was very high (4.5 × 106 copies/mL). The results of Southern blot analysis of peripheral blood revealed rearranged bands of T-cell receptor (TCR) J? and ? chain genes. One year later, she was readmitted with dyspnea due to pericardial effusion at the age of 46 years. Examination of pericardial fluid, bone marrow clot, and liver biopsy specimens showed EBV-positive, cytotoxic molecule–positive T cells without atypia. EBV terminal repeat analysis revealed oligoclonal bands in pericardial fluid. Although the patient received multiagent chemotherapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, she developed EBV+ CTL (tumor 2) involving the oral cavity, soft tissue of the lower leg, the esophagus, and lymph nodes at the age of 47 years, 2.5 years after the diagnosis of CAEBV/TNK-LPD. The patient died of pneumonia 4 months after transplantation at the age of 48 years, indicating a very long clinical course of 18 years after the initial diagnosis.   2.2 Pathology and genetics Macroscopic examination of the resected ileum revealed an ulcerated tumor measuring 17 × 8 cm in diameter. Microscopically, the tumor (tumor 1; Fig. A-D) revealed a diffuse proliferation of medium- to large-sized atypical lymphocytes with coagulative necrosis but without angiocentric growth pattern. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD2, CD3, CD8, CD30, EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization, Granzyme B, LMP-1, Perforin, and TIA-1 and negative for CD4, CD5, CD7, CD20, CD56, ALK, EBNA2, TCR-?, and TCR-?. At the time of operation for the intestinal lymphoma, a liver biopsy was obtained to evaluate the activity of hepatitis C. Surprisingly, EBV-positive small lymphocytes without atypia were retrospectively detected in this specimen (Fig. E) despite the lack of findings suggestive of active hepatitis. Notably, these EBV+ cells were small in size and were scattered in the sinus and portal area of the liver. Neoplastic cells from tumor 2 (Fig. F) exhibited almost the same morphology as had been observed in tumor 1. The lymphoma cells were diffusely positive for CD56. They were also positive for CD2, CD3, CD8, CD30, EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization, Granzyme B, Perforin, and TIA-1 and negative for CD4, CD5, CD7, CD20, ALK, EBNA2, LMP-1, TCR-?, and TCR-?. A clonal TCR-? gene rearrangement was detected by polymerase chain reaction in tumor 1, tumor 2, the bone marrow clot, and the liver biopsy specimen that was obtained at the age of 47 years. The latter 3 specimens were obtained after the development of CAEBV/TNK-LPD. This molecular study for TCR-? chain gene rearrangement demonstrated a clone of identical size in these 4 specimens.  "

A longitudinal case report"," 2 Case reports Our patient is a 14-year-old African American male who presented with a seven month history of recurrent left sided nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and epistaxis at age 8. Initially, the patient presented to primary care physicians and was advised only symptomatic treatment for his non-specific symptoms. He was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics without resolution of symptoms. He developed recurrent fever, weight loss, poor appetite and change in tone of voice. Family history was positive for leukemia (type unknown) in a second cousin. On examination, nasal mucosa was pale and boggy with thick mucoid discharge bilaterally. Oral cavity and ear examinations were normal. No cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. Liver and spleen were not palpable, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the face showed a poorly circumscribed non-enhancing mass completely filling the left nasal cavity without extension into the nasopharynx. The mass displaced the inferior turbinate and the nasal septum slightly to the right (Fig. 1 ). At the request of his referring physician (MAJ) he then underwent an endoscopic exam by ENT under general anesthesia showing a large obstructing mass that appeared friable and papillomatous. It seemed to be originating from the anterior portion of the inferior turbinate. A biopsy was taken, showing infiltration of the submucosa by heterogeneous sheets of atypical lymphocyte populations (Fig. 2 ). Mitoses were focally conspicuous. The majority of the tumor cells were positive for in-situ hybridization stains for Epstein–Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER). These biopsy findings were suggestive of ENKTL. For additional assurance, the specimens were re-interpreted at the affiliated St Jude's hospital pathology department and their interpretation did not support the diagnosis of ENKTL, referring to the specimens as displaying atypical EBV-positive mixed lymphoid infiltrates. The discrepancy dictated a repeat biopsy. A biopsy of the right inferior turbinate at St Jude's confirmed the diagnosis of ENKTL since at this time both nasal passages were involved and the mucosa appeared inflamed without a distinct mass. Overall he required three nasal biopsies until a definitive diagnosis could be obtained (11/2010). The neoplastic cell population was CD2+, CD3+ and CD7+ and appearred CD5 (?). The atypical infiltrate contained a prominent population of small, medium and large cells that are CD56+++, TIA ?1++ and granzyme B++ as well as EBV+++ on immune-peroxidase staining (Fig. 2). Full staging included bone marrow biopsy, CSF examination, and PET scan and showed that the disease was not present at any other site. He was started on a chemotherapy regimen consistent of dexamethasone, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (DeVIC chemotherapy) [13] concurrent with local radiotherapy (54Gy). The regimen was based on studies showing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy to be superior to radiotherapy alone or sequential chemo-radiotherapy for this aggressive lymphoma [13,14]. He received biweekly triple treatment with MTX, HC and ARA-C. He tolerated 2cycles of chemotherapy relatively well. However, he had an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizures during the 2nd course. This prompted neurological evaluation for intracranial disease including MRI brain and was within normal limits. Levetiracetam was started as per neurologist's advice and a decision was made to omit the last cycle. He completed his radiation therapy. His evaluation showed full remission and repeat MRI of the face showed resolution of the mass. He was regularly followed up in the outpatient clinic with serial MRIs and endoscopic office examinations by ENT to monitor for recurrence. A repeat right sided endoscopic nasal biopsy (3/2011) showed only scar tissue without evidence for ENKTL recurrence. Bone marrow biopsy was repeated to exclude medullary involvement, and was negative. Nine months later, pain, epistaxis and nasal obstruction prompted a repeat MRI of the face showing new thickening of the nasal mucosa. Repeat nasal endoscopy and bilateral biopsies showed bilateral ENKTL recurrence in both posterior nasal cavities. The primary caregiver (patient's biological mother) was offered treatment with stem cell transplant however, despite detailed discussion about the aggressive nature of the tumor and poor prognosis, she refused on the basis of hardship on the family from required travel. Salvage therapy was given after full staging. MRI on 12/2011 showed persistence of partially enhancing mass in the nasal cavity left greater than right which protruded into the nasopharynx. The patient was treated with high dose methotrexate (3g/m2), dexamethasone and l-asparaginase. The regimen has been found to be effective in relapsed NK cell NHL [15]. He received three cycles with a partial response. Leucovorin and pegfilgrastim rescue were also given along with chemotherapy. Following chemotherapy, repeat endoscopic biopsies of the left nasal and sinus mucosa were negative. Further chemotherapy was planned due to this change in the proposed management with fludarabine added to the l-asparaginase regimen. Fludarabine, a purine nucleoside analogue, has shown an added effect in patients with non-HD lymphomas [16]. Fludarabine (25mg/m2 IV) from days 1 to 5 and l-asparaginase (6000units/m2 IV) on days 2, 5 and 8 were both given. Each cycle was 28days in length and six such cycles were undertaken. Patient tolerated the chemotherapy well and subsequently remained in remission; clinical, pathological, endoscopic and radiological follow-up were continued. Sixteen months later (9/13) both nasal and sinus mucosal biopsies showed only focal atypical lymphoid infiltrates (FALI), however, biopsy of the adenoid tissue also was suspicious for involvement with ENKTL due to the presence of FALI. No new treatment was initiated. Six months later (3/14) the patient presented with progressive hoarseness, difficulty breathing and stridor. Endoscopic airway evaluation under general anesthesia showed an exophytic mass of the postcricoid area as well as the right false cord and the subglottic area extending into the trachea. The tissue was very friable and biopsies from separate anatomical locations were taken. A microdebrider was used to excise/debulk the mass from the supraglottic and postcricoid area. The subglottic debridement was conservative dictated by anatomical limitations. Biopsy results indicated ENKTL relapse in the larynx (Fig. 3 ). The subglottic tissue had FALI, and the nasal biopsies showed FALI in the R ethmoid, ENKTL in the left nose. Due to his very good response previously, the prior chemotherapy regimen, fludarabine and l-asparaginase, and dexamethasone (10mg) was repeated. l-Asparaginase was switched to PEG-asparaginase (requiring reduced number of shots needed and drug shortage at the time). Two months after completion of chemotherapy, the patient was taken back to the operating room to undergo endoscopic exam under general anesthesia with biopsies. The epiglottis was very short. Its superior part had been consumed by the tumor and was now scarred post chemotherapy, but no signs of tumor were present. The free edge was also without obvious tumor infiltration. Arytenoids and postcricoid area where the bulk of the tumor was visualized and debulked previously, was free of disease. A scar appearing in the mucosa of the arytenoid area was noted and biopsy proved negative for tumor. The subglottis and trachea had small fine scar bands on the posterior wall and was disease-free in appearance. Nasal endoscopic exam showed a small fragile bleeding area in the left lateral nasal wall just anterior to the maxillary ostium but biopsy was negative for disease recurrence. His last chemotherapy was on 5/2014 and he remains disease-free as of 5/2016 as evidenced by interval endoscopy, MRI and PET scan findings. "

In 2013, bone marrow biopsy is performed: histopathologic aspects plead for a granulomatous reaction. In 2014 the patient presents in our clinic with axillary and inguinal adenopathy, erythematous micropapules arranged in plaques located on the trunk and the upper and lower limbs. We performed a new cutaneous biopsy that revealed a noncaseating granulomatous reaction and epidermotropism, which could be found in several granulomatous diseases. Serum biologic tests: elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Tuberculin test: tuberculin anergy. Pulmonary radiography and abdominal ultrasound: no significant changes. For a better further understanding of this disease we performed genetic testing: T-cell receptor beta locus good quality; several small copy number variations (CNV)/copy number alterations (CNA); MLLT4 gain or possibly rearrangement. A diagnosis of late-onset childhood Sarcoidosis was made based on the typical noncaseating epithelioid cell granuloma in combination with elevated ACE, ESR, and tuberculin anergy. The patient was treated with oral prednisone starting a dosage of 30 mg daily (gradually reduced) and Acitretin 10 mg daily.

254,S2253-8089(13)00152-3,Neurolymphomatosis as a late relapse of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT: A case report," Clinical case A 53-year-old male complaining about sharp pain in his right hip region and numbness in his right leg was examined by his treating physician. His right testis was removed 3 years earlier because of irritability and enlargement. Histological diagnosis confirmed NHL that was identified as diffuse large B cell phenotype. The first 18F-FDG PET/CT scan, which was performed after the removal of the testis, showed numerous lymph nodes with high FDG uptake on both sides of the diaphragm with the highest maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 32.2 observed in the head and neck region on the right side (Fig. 1 ). The second PET/CT scan was performed after 4 cycles and the third after 6 cycles rituximab, methotrexate, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and vincristine (R-M-BACOD) treatment and they were both negative for lymphoma. First line treatment led to complete remission and in the following 24 months the patient did not have any clinical symptoms. However, 29 months after the initial diagnosis the above mentioned hip region pain and right leg paraesthesia were developed. Orthopaedic physical examination and CT did not provide a clue, lumbar MRI showed slight protrusion of L5-S1 disc. Physiotherapy and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids were inefficient, the intensity of pain increased over time and walking difficulty appeared. The fourth whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed 4 months after the onset of the symptoms. The patient fasted for 4h because of diabetes prior to scanning and his fasting glucemia level was 6.4mmol/l. A standard dose of FDG 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1mCi/kg) was injected intravenously 70min prior to scanning. The emission data were acquired with a TruePoint HD PET/CT scanner (Siemens, Knoxville, TN). 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed focal FDG uptake in the region of the right S1 nerve root and linear FDG uptake along the right sacral plexus with SUVmax of 11.6 and 5.2, respectively (Fig. 2a–d). It raised the suspicion of NL. The bone marrow was depicted with increased, diffuse FDG uptake without any focal character. Functional muscle activity and diffuse bowel activity were also noted. The second MRI which was recommended because of the suspicion of NL, showed thickening of right S1 nerve root and enlargement of the sacral plexus with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. The symptoms were markedly relieved following the surgical removal of tumorous mass of S1 nerve root (Fig. 3a–d). The histological examination of the removed specimen confirmed the relapse of DLBCL. Bone marrow infiltration was excluded by biopsy that was performed because of its diffuse FDG uptake. There was not any pathological FDG uptake on the subsequent PET/CT scans performed after four cycles of rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatin (R-DHAP) chemotherapy and after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ASCT) (Fig. 4 ). The patient is currently in complete remission for 13 months. Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to all scans. "
260,S2214-3300(15)30062-6,KSHV/HHV-8 associated lymph node based lymphomas in HIV seronegative subjects. Case report and review of the literature," 2 Clinical summary A 29-year-old female emigrant to the United States from a central African country presented to her primary care physician (PCP) for routine clinical check-up. She was asymptomatic and her review of systems was within normal limits. A complete blood count showed normal white blood cell (6.6K/?L) and platelet counts (307K/?L), while the hematocrit was low (28.8%), with a high red blood cell distribution width (18.9%), which was thought to be due to iron deficiency. Her past medical history was notable for syphilis. The patient reported that ovarian cysts were discovered on examination and seen on pelvic ultrasound 6years ago, and she had been followed clinically since then. As part of the follow-up for ovarian cysts, a CT scan performed on 8/28/12 demonstrated incidental splenomegaly, and extensive mediastinal, abdominal, and pelvic lymphadenopathy concerning for lymphoma (Fig. 1 ). A subsequent PET scan on 9/18/12 demonstrated uptake in the previously described nodes. A core needle biopsy of the right pelvic lymph node was performed for tissue diagnosis on 9/25/12. It demonstrated a high-grade, HHV8+, EBV+ large-cell lymphoma (Fig. 2 ). A staging bone marrow biopsy was negative. Of note, the patient tested negative for HIV twice, by both serology and PCR. Screening for viral hepatitis B and C was also negative. Her blood leukocyte differentials were within normal limits on multiple occasions, while a serum protein electrophoresis showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. There was no other specific testing undertaken to exclude other primary or acquired immunodeficiency disorders. The patient elected to forgo treatment secondary to social and financial reasons. Despite this, she remained asymptomatic and a follow-up CT scan performed three months after the initial diagnosis demonstrated stability of the abdominal masses with no increase in size. Her LDH levels, and liver and renal function tests remained normal on multiple occasions.  2.1 Pathologic findings  2.1.1 Cytology of touch imprints Tumor cells show prominent anaplastic features with large, pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 2A).   2.1.2 Histomorphology Sections of the right pelvic lymph node core biopsy show diffuse sheets of anaplastic cells, some with distinct cell borders (Fig. 2B–D). The nuclei are large and highly pleomorphic, with one or several nucleoli, and the cytoplasm is abundant and amphophilic. Bi- and multi-nucleated cells are seen, including some with ‘horse-shoe’-shaped nuclei. Frequent mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies are noted.   2.1.3 Immunohistochemistry The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for CD45 and have dim, subset expression of B-cell marker CD20, but not CD79a. They co-express CD30, MUM1, CD138 (subset), EMA, and are strongly and diffusely positive for both HHV8 epitopes and Epstein–Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER). They express T-cell markers CD3 and CD2 (dim subset), and the cytotoxic protein granzyme B, but are negative for other pan T-cell markers (CD5, CD7, CD4, CD8) and the cytotoxic protein perforin. They are additionally negative for pancytokeratin (AE1.3, Cam5.2 cocktail), ALK-1, and for kappa and lambda light chain expression by in-situ hybridization studies. See Fig. 3  and Table 1 .   2.1.4 Molecular study PCR studies identify a clonal B-cell gene rearrangement, while T-cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement is negative. Extracavitary primary effusion lymphoma (ExPEL) involves lymph nodes, solid organs, and other tissues, without evidence of cavitary effusion. It occurs predominantly in HIV+ men who often present with acute symptoms. Although there are reported immunophenotypic differences [ExPEL has lower frequency of expression of CD45 (74% versus 94%), CD30 (63% versus 76%), and EMA (57% versus 75%), but higher frequency of expression of CD20 (17% versus 5%), CD79a (23% versus 5%) and CD138 (70% versus 38%)] [5]; ExPEL generally shows similar morphology, immunophenotype, genotype, and HHV8 viral status to classic PEL (Table 1). The malignant cells are large and exhibit a range of appearances, from immunoblastic or plasmablastic cells to those with more-anaplastic characteristics. Their immunophenotype often reflects that of a mature B-cell shifting toward terminal plasma cell differentiation. Commonly expressed markers are plasma-cell-related antigen CD138 (73% positive), activation marker CD30 (61% positive), and epithelial membrane antigen (57% positive). The key diagnostic criterion for PEL is the presence of HHV8 in the nuclei of the malignant cells. The most common method for detecting HHV8-positivity is immunohistochemical staining for the latent viral gene product, known as latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1). Despite the usual co-infection with EBV as seen by in situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (75% of cases are EBER positive), staining for latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is often negative [7]. Although complex and recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified in the tumor cells of PELs, none are specific or characteristic [8]. Some reported recurrent genetic abnormalities include trisomy 7, trisomy 12, and chromosomal aberrations of bands 1q21–25. Immunoglobulin genes are often rearranged (82% of cases), and can be used to demonstrate a monoclonal B cell population by molecular methods [9]. In our case, the diagnosis of ExPEL was established by the overall morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular findings.    2.2 Differential diagnosis ExPEL has to be differentiated from other lymphoproliferative disorders that exhibit immunoblastic or plasmablastic or anaplastic morphologies, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with immunoblastic morphology, ALK1+ large B-cell lymphoma (ALK1+ LBCL), and plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma (PCM). Other HHV8+ lymphoproliferative disorders must also be ruled-out, including multicentric Castleman disease (MCD)-associated, HHV-8-positive LBCL (LBL-MCD), and germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder. ALCL morphologic features include cells with anaplastic/pleomorphic morphology, horseshoe-shaped hallmark cells, and intrasinusoidal involvement. Similar to ExPEL, most ALCLs exhibit strong positivity for CD30 and EMA. Fortunately, these can be distinguished by their ALK1 reactivity and absence of CD138 and HHV-8 [3]. PBL is a large B-cell lymphoma with highest frequency in HIV+ individuals. It most often presents as a mass at mucosal sites, particularly in the oral cavity [3,10]. The tumor cells are positive for plasma cell marker CD138. Unlike ExPELs, which tend to lack expression of surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, 50–70% of PBLs exhibit cytoplasmic immunoglobulin G. EBV infection is found in 60–75% of PBLs; however, HHV8 is consistently absent [3]. Immunoblastic variant of DLBCL is characterized by the presence of greater than 90% immunoblasts, which exhibit abundant cytoplasm and a single, centrally located nucleolus. The lesional cells are usually strongly positive for B-cell markers such as CD20, PAX5, and CD79a, and are negative for ALK1 and HHV-8 [3]. ALK+ LBCL may show sinusoidal growth and plasmablastic differentiation, including the expression of CD138, MUM1, and EMA. In contrast with ExPEL, however, it is negative for CD30 and HHV-8, and is characteristically strongly positive for ALK1 [3]. Plasmablastic/anaplastic plasma cell myeloma has significant morphologic similarity to ExPEL, especially those with plasmablastic features. However, their clinical presentations are quite different. Plasmablastic/anaplastic plasma cell myeloma typically presents with serum paraproteinemia and lytic bone lesions. The disease typically involves bone marrow of patients without associated HIV, HHV8, or EBV infection. By immunohistochemistry, myeloma cells express CD138 and MUM1, but not CD30 and CD45. Cytoplasmic light chains are generally detectable in the cells of plasmablastic/anaplastic plasma cell myeloma, in contrast to ExPEL [3]. LBL-MCD is an HHV8-driven lesion occurring in patients with or without HIV, and mainly involves the lymph nodes and spleen [3]. By histology, HH8+ plasmablasts are found in the mantle zones of atretic secondary follicles admixed with normal plasma cells. While the plasmablasts in LBL-MCD express high levels of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin M, most cases of ExPEL lack cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. Additionally, LBL-MCD is not associated with EBV, whereas ExPEL is commonly co-infected with this virus. Germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder presents as localized lymphadenopathy in immunocompetent patients, and in contrast to other entities considered in the differential diagnosis of ExPEL, shows a favorable response to chemo- or radiotherapy. Histologically, it is characterized by HHV8+, EBV+ plasmablasts that preferentially involve germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, forming confluent aggregates. The lesional cells in germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder are typically negative for B-cell antigens (CD20, CD79a) and the plasma cell marker CD138, but exhibit kappa or lambda surface light chain and contain cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. Interestingly, they usually demonstrate a polyclonal or oligoclonal pattern of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement [3,11].  "
261,S2211-0348(17)30048-2,A case of CD30+ ALK1- anaplastic large cell lymphoma resembling acute disseminated encephalomyelitis," 2 Discussion Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) regards about 3% of non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHLs) in adults (Kinney et al., 2011). CNS involvement at diagnosis occurs in approximately 3% of patients suffering from ALCL, thus CNS is considered an extremely rare site to be involved in systemic ALCL (Nomura et al., 2013). Most cases of systemic ALCL with secondary CNS involvement concern pediatric or immunocompromised patients. In our patient the first diagnostic approach was of having ADEM, which is usually triggered by an inflammatory response to viral infections. The scenario of a CMV infection preceding the development of neurological manifestations was likely due to the finding of high titers CMV IgG and IgM antibodies. Additionally, the morphology, size, number and distribution of lesions in brain MRI, as well as patients' clinical improvement after corticotherapy, strengthened the possibility of ADEM. Upon clinical relapse after corticosteroid discontinuation and considering that ADEM is usually monophasic, initial diagnosis was set under question. The presence of systemic manifestations, such as dermatitis, lymphadenopathy and anemia at the time of relapse, was the key point that led to the final diagnosis of CD30+ ALK1- anaplastic large cell lymphoma. A foggy issue is the presence of IgG and IgM CMV antibodies. One possible explanation is a co-incidental CMV infection which maybe triggered the CNS involvement. Another scenario is that of cross reaction which driven to false positive serum CMV antibodies. Another challenging point in our case is that brain MRI findings (multiple disseminated non-enhancing lesions without restricted diffusion) were in accordance to ADEM. On the other hand secondary CNS lymphomas have specific imaging features such as intense homogeneous or ring-like gadolinium enhancement and restricted water diffusion (Haldorsen et al., 2011). In our patient those features were absent making the diagnosis even more difficult. Brain biopsy would have been a useful tool for the identification of the lesions' nature, but unfortunately our patient denied undergoing brain biopsy. It is our belief that CNS involvement was secondarily in the setting of systemic ALCL. Although a brain biopsy was never performed to prove this scenario, the fact that significant radiological improvement was observed after chemotherapy strengthens this hypothesis. ADEM-like presentation has rarely been reported in cases of primary CNS B-cell lymphomas (Lee et al., 2012). To our knowledge this is the first report of a systemic ALCL mimicking ADEM. Due to the rarity of this type of lymphoma, radiological and clinicopathological characteristics and sufficient treatment of secondary CNS involvement have not been extensively described (Zhang et al., 2011). Lack of data about brain imaging of CD30+ ALK- ALCL, is a possible explanation concerning the mismatch in MRI features between our case and the majority of secondary CNS B-cell lymphomas. "

Bone marrow biopsy was performed, showing a cellularity of 30%, a myeloerythroid relationship of 3:1, dyserythropoietic changes in red cells, myeloid series with a slight deviation to the left and 1% CD34+ cellularity. Negative fibrosis. No phenotypic abnormalities compatible with the lymphoproliferative syndrome were observed on flow cytometry. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was requested, with oral and endovenous contrast, showing homogeneous splenomegaly as the only finding. On persistence of the symptomatology a PET-CT with FDG was requested to localize the disease. The patient presented with 8h of fasting and glycemia of 92mg/dl prior to the study. A dose of 377.77 MBq (10.21mCi) was injected one hour prior to the study. For opacification of the intestinal loops the patient ingested one liter of water dissolved with 30ml of iodine, and during the tomography 70ml of non-ionic contrast were injected. The study showed an increase in diffuse metabolic activity in both pulmonary parenchyma accompanied by a subtle increase of bilateral parenchymous attenuation (diffuse) (Fig. 1A). Homogenous splenomegaly and discrete diffuse uptake of the radiotracer was also observed in the bone marrow (Fig. 1B). The SUVmax of the lung (left base), the spleen and bone marrow (L2) was of 6.0, 3.4 and 3.6, respectively. In view of these findings a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed which was normal. A slight increase in the number of small lymphocytes was of note. Finally, surgical biopsy was performed demonstrating pulmonary tissue with preserved structure which showed thickened septa in some sectors by the presence of atypical cells with large positive nuclei with lymphoid markers and CD20 in the interior of the capillary vessels. Some medium sized vessels were also affected (Fig. 2 ). The anatomopathologic result was a large B-cell CD20+ intravascular lymphoma. "

She presented a rapidly progressive course with the appearance, 48hours after admission, of midline destructive disease involving the upper lip, nostrils, and nasal septum, with impaired consciousness and poor glycaemic control. Debridement of necrotic tissues was performed (Fig. 1 ) with histopathological, bacteriological, and mycological examination. Centrifugal extension of the necrosis was observed with subsequent involvement of the cheeks, forehead, palate, and nasal pyramid. No cervical lymphadenopathy, respiratory disorders, or haematuria were observed on clinical examination. The laboratory work-up revealed normal C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, mild leukocytosis with 11,500/mm3 white blood cells, severe hypokalaemia (potassium: 1.5mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (glucose: 3.6g/L). Several diagnoses were proposed at this stage: gangrenous cellulitis, invasive mycotic rhinosinusitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, actinomycosis, or facial T-cell lymphoma. Three days after admission, the patient died in a context of septicaemia and multi-organ failure. The final histological examination concluded on aggressive lymphoma (diffuse, atypical perivascular lymphoid infiltrate with images of angiocentrism and angio-invasion, presence of large areas of ischaemic necrosis) and immunohistochemistry concluded on CD2+, CD3+, CD56+, and EBV+ nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.

The following antibodies were used: CD20 (clone L26, 1:500, Dako), CD79a (clone JCB117, 1:50, Dako), CD23 (clone 1B12, 1:50, Leica), CD21 (clone 2G9, 1:50, Novocastra), CD3 (clone F7.2.38, 1:10, Purpan), CD5 (clone SP19, 1:50, Dako), CD10 (clone 56C6, 1:50, Dako), BCL2 (clone 124, 1:50, Dako), TDT (clone SEN28, 1:50, Dako), Cyclin D1(clone SP4, 1: 25, Dako), MUM1 (Clone MUM1p, 1:25, Dako) and SOX11 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100, Atlas). Positive and negative controls were used.   Cytogenetic analysis Conventional chromosomal analysis was performed on bone marrow cells cultured 24h without mitogens. Twenty metaphase cells were analyzed after R-banding. Chromosomal aberrations are described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature 2009 (ISCN 2009). Fluorescence in situ-hybridization (FISH) was performed with non-commercial probes from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones for IGL locus, CCDN1 locus and MYC locus. Probes were directly labeled with SpectrumOrange- and SpectrumGreen-d-UTP (Abbott Molecular) using random priming. The IGL and MYC probes were dual-color, break-apart probes, whereas CCND1 probe was single-color probe. FISH images were acquired with a 100×/1.4 oil-immersion objective in an Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope equipped with an Axiophot 2 camera (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Twenty metaphases and 200 interphasic cells were analyzed for each probe  "
277,S0165-5876(13)00111-0,Primary endobronchial Burkitt's lymphoma in a child: A case report," 2 Case report A 4-year-old girl with a history of persistent cough and low-grade fever for one month had been hospitalized in March 2008. She was treated as asthma and pneumonia and her symptoms improved promptly. One month later, however, her symptoms had deteriorated, and she was admitted to the hospital again. Despite intravenous administration of antibiotics, atelectasis of the left lung showed little improvement. Thus, she was suspected of having a foreign body in the left bronchus, and she was referred to our hospital in May 2008. At admission, her body temperature was 37.6°C, her percutaneous oxygen saturation was 95%, and her pulse rate was 157 beats per minute although she had little dyspnea. Breathing sound was decreased in the left lung. Laboratory studies showed the following results: white blood cell count 11,640/?L, including 7624/?L lymphocytes and 3550/?L neutrocytes; red blood cell count 5.13×106/?L; hemoglobin 14.1g/dL; platelets 40.7×104/?L. All biochemical tests were normal, including lactate dehydrogenate and C-reactive protein. Chest X-ray revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung (Fig. 1 a). Computed tomography (CT) did not show radio-opaque foreign bodies in the lower respiratory airway but collapse of the left lung and deviation of the mediastinum to the left (Fig. 2 a). On the night of admission, a bronchoscopic examination was performed under general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask. The examination revealed complete occlusion of the left main bronchus by soft granulomatous tissue (Fig. 3 ). Using forceps, we partially removed the tissue in a piecemeal fashion, although complete removal was impossible due to hemorrhage. Thereafter, she was treated with tracheal intubation and was given a corticosteroid in the intensive care unit. The histopathological examination showed marked hyperplasia of lymphoid cells with a starry sky pattern (Fig. 4 ). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor was positive for CD20 and CD79a, and negative for TdT. Nearly all of the lymphoid cells (99%) were positive for MiB1. With these findings, Burkitt's lymphoma of the left bronchus was diagnosed. After intravenous administration of methylprednisolone (30mg/kg for 3 days), atelectasis of the left lung was improved (Fig. 1b), and tracheal extubation was successful 6 days later. Whole body positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) showed no abnormal uptake after the steroid administration. Spinal fluid and bone marrow examinations revealed no abnormality. She was treated subsequently with methotrexate, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin. Six months after the initial treatment, she remained recurrence free. "
284,S1027-8117(12)00085-7,Blastoid mantle cell lymphoma involving skin and orbit with hypercalcemia: A case report and literature review," Case report A 53-year-old man presented with dark purple nodules and plaques on the left temporal region, right palpebra frontalis (Figure 1 A), abdomen (Figure 1B), and bilateral lower extremities for ½ month, and the left periorbital region swelled 4 days prior to his initial visit to our department of dermatology. Physical examination revealed significant superficial lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly. Serum calcium and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were increased to 3.12mmol/L (normal 2.03–2.65mmol/L) and 853U/L (normal 71–231U/L), respectively. The agarose gel electrophoresis showed a monoclonal immunoglobulin IgM (? chain). Positron emission tomography computed tomography scan showed multiple areas of abnormal uptake in lymph nodes, back wall of pharynx, and spleen. Bone marrow aspirate revealed active myeloid proliferation and 42% of lymphoblast was observed. Flow cytometry displayed CD20 (93.7%), CD22 (91.0%), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR (99.3%), CD19 (82.9%), CD79a (95.2%), cytoplasma K (98.0%), CD2 (51.5%), and CD15 (32.7%). CD13, CD56, CD41, CD61, and CD42a were all negative. Histopathologic examination of the skin nodule in the neck revealed atypical lymphoid cells (Figure 2 B) infiltrated nodular distribution in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue (Figure 2A). Immunophenotype of the abnormal lymphocytes indicated positive reactions for L26 (Figure 2C), CD79a, Bcl-2, Cyclin D1 (Figure 2D), Mum-1 (partly), and Ki-67 (>80%), but negative for CD5 (Figure 2D), CD21, CD23, CD38, CD3, CD10, Bcl-6, UCHL-1, TdT, MPO, CD30, ALK, CD117, and CD34. The translocation t(11:14) juxtaposes the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) at 11q13 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) promoter locus at chromosome 14q32, which may be implicated in the pathogenesis and development of lymphomas, and can be found in virtually all cases of MCL by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. The patient's result of FISH analysis with the CCND1/IGH probe revealed a yellow fusion signal on the abnormal lymphocytes (Figure 3 ). Based on the cytological characterization of the infiltrated tumor cells (monomorphic sheets of small- to medium-sized blasts with finely dispersed chromatin mimicking lymphoblastic lymphoma) and clinical data, the diagnosis was blastoid MCL (stage IVB) with hypercalcemia. R-Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy was delivered: rituximab 700mg d0 (only 50mg was used as the patient did not tolerate it well because of chilling and fever), cyclophosphamide 1.5g q12h d1–3, vincristine 2mg d4 and d11, theprubicin (THP) 90mg d4, and dexamethasone 40mg d1–4 and d11–14. Three days later, serum calcium became normal. On the 6th day, the lesions on the temporal site of the head, abdomen, and bilateral lower extremities had significantly diminished. Edema around the orbit ameliorated, and the patient could open his eyes (Figure 1). Unfortunately, the patient eventually died of pneumonia 1 month later. "
285,S1516-8484(16)30113-X,Primary breast lymphoma: a case report,"We report the case of a 46-year-old female, with no medical history of interest, who consulted due to the appearance of a 4-cm tumor in the left breast of six months of evolution. We proceeded with the study, making radiological imaging (mammogram and magnetic resonance) and histopathological investigations. The examinations conducted, including blood count, biochemistry, serologies, and tumor markers, were normal highlighting slightly elevated ?2-microglobulin levels (2.9mg/L). Mammography and magnetic resonance findings were suggestive of breast cancer. Histological examination showed a tumor composed of a large-sized cell infiltrate, with scarce cytoplasm, irregular nuclear membrane, split cells with prominent nucleoli, and numerous mitoses. The immunohistochemical study showed positivity for tumor populations CD19, CD20, CD79a, PAX-5, bcl-2, bcl-6 and MUM-1 and focally for CD10 and negativity for cyclin D1 and CD38 (Figure 1 ). Ki 67 was 80%. Given the combination of clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of primary diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was established, warranting an extended study with a cervico-thoraco-abdomino-pelvic scan and bone marrow biopsy to rule out lymphadenopathies and bone marrow infiltration. With the diagnosis of primary diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chemotherapy was established using the R-CHOP scheme (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone)."
290,S0022-3468(12)00980-3,Intestinal perforation after treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma: Case report and review of the literature," 1 Case presentation The patient, a 12 year old male with a history of obesity (BMI 33), hypertension, and epilepsy, presented to his primary pediatrician for a routine annual check-up with some mild abdominal pain complaints. On abdominal exam, a non-tender, non-mobile mass in the right upper quadrant was palpated; no other abdominal abnormalities were noted. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. He was sent directly to the emergency room for further work-up of the mass. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of a 14 cm × 14 cm × 17cm mass in the right mid-abdomen which extended into the ascending colon with associated ascites and lymphadenopathy involving supraclavicular and mediastinal nodes (Fig. 1 ). At this point, the suspected diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma, given the patient's age, the large mass size, and its apparent rapid appearance, although other types of lymphoma and retroperitoneal sarcomas were included in the differential diagnosis. A laparoscopic biopsy, performed concurrently with a bone marrow biopsy, a lumbar puncture, and a port placement, confirmed the diagnosis of Stage III Burkitt's lymphoma. Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid were negative for malignancy. Reduction chemotherapy was initiated based on the Children's Oncology Group protocol ANHL01P1. He received a preliminary week of reduction chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide, vincristine, oral prednisone, intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone. Approximately one week following initiation of chemotherapy, he developed acute onset diffuse peritonitis and fever. A repeat CT scan demonstrated a contained perforation in the ascending colon (Fig. 2 ). He was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, extended right hemicolectomy, end ileostomy, and mucus fistula formation. At laparotomy, a large, inflammatory tumor mass was noted in the right upper quadrant, adherent to the right colon, which had perforated. Due to the size and inflammatory nature of the tumor, we elected to resect only the involved portion of bowel, leaving behind residual mass. He received an additional week of reduction chemotherapy with intravenous Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and oral prednisone. Intrathecal chemotherapy was omitted during this cycle. Subsequently, he received induction chemotherapy with intravenous Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, oral prednisone, intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone (Table 1 ). Four days after beginning this cycle, the patient reported pain around his ileostomy site and quickly developed peritoneal signs and high fever. At that time his absolute neutrophil count was zero. He was resuscitated and taken to the operating room for reexploration (Day 27, Table 1). The abdominal cavity was densely matted with adhesions. There was a perforation in a loop of ileum. Because of the adhesions it was not deemed safe to mobilize the intestine. Drains were placed to create a controlled enterocutaneous fistula. Due to third spacing, the abdomen could not be closed. The fascia was left open. Two days later, at a repeat exploration, multiple perforations were noted. A negative pressure vacuum system was applied to control the enteric drainage, protect the skin, and promote wound healing. For 10days following surgery, he remained in critical condition requiring ventilatory support and pressors. After he stabilized, chemotherapy was resumed. He received an additional induction and two consolidation cycles containing intravenous Rituximab, vincristine, methotrexate, cytarabine, intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone. In both induction and consolidation cycles, additional omissions of intravenous chemotherapies were made based on changing clinical status (Table 1). He returned to the operating room 37 times for dressing changes, debridement, and additional placement of drains to control the enteric fistulae. In addition, he had multiple central line infections with gram positive cocci, Candida tropicalis, and Enterobacter. He remained dependent on parenteral nutrition, and developed narcotic dependence that required weaning with methadone. He became extremely deconditioned, requiring intensive physical therapy. After 182days in the hospital, he was discharged with no evidence of disease and an open abdomen covered by a stoma bag to continue recuperation at home (Fig. 3 ). Final closure was delayed while the patient underwent further nutritional and physical therapy. After over 400days with an open abdomen, the patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, takedown of enterocutaneous fistulas, segmental bowel resection and anastomosis × 5, ileocolostomy, loop jejunostomy, and bilateral abdominal wall component separation with Strattice mesh reconstruction. Final ostomy takedown was performed four months later. Two years following diagnosis, the patient currently has no gastrointestinal complaints, has a closed abdomen, has normal liver function tests, remains in remission from his lymphoma, and has returned to his normal activity (Fig. 4 ).

292,S1473-0502(13)00099-2,"Rare manifestation of the thrombotic microangiopathy in a patient with sarcoidosis, common variable immunodeficiency and large B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma: Case report"," 2 Case report In August 2011, a 58-year old Caucasian woman was admitted to the hospital due to anemia with thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure, while recovering from enterocolitis. TMA was suspected. She has had frequent infections (sinusitis, diarrhea, respiratory infections) since 2010 spring. Because of splenomegaly and anemia, bone marrow biopsy was performed in September 2010 which showed multiple granulomas without central necrosis. Microorganisms were not histochemically proved in the granulomas. Within the T lymphocytes, the CD8+ regulatory T cells were predominant. Due to the suspicion on sarcoidosis, computed tomography (CT) of the chest was done, which showed thickening of the ground glass but without changes typical for sarcoidosis. Respiratory function tests were normal. Bronchus aspirates on tuberculosis, pathogenic bacteria and amplification test were negative. In the bronchoalveolar lavage there was a mixed cell alveolitis with the lowered ratio of CD4/CD8 and a higher proportion of natural killer cells cells. Lung biopsy samples showed no malignant cells, histological report revealed an unspecific cellular infiltration, suspicious for granuloma. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made by pulmonologist following a history of anorexia, weight loss, splenomegaly, an elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme level, hypercalcemia and granuloma in bone marrow biopsy. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone. During this treatment repetitive infection continued: disseminated herpes zoster, sinusitis of both maxillary, left frontal and left ethmoid sinuses, perianal abscess, aphta in the lining of the mouth. In August 2011 the patient developed diarrhea, nausea, and headache. The clinical examination showed no significant features other than splenomegaly and Cushingoid appearance. Laboratory tests on admission showed MAHA with thrombocytopenia and acute non-oliguric renal failure. Auto antibodies against ADAMTS 13 were negative, there was no deficiency of ADAMTS 13. Immunoglobulin levels were low with IgG<4.4g/L, IgA<0.9g/L and IgM<0.3g/L, CVID was suspected. Coagulation tests showed no signs of possible disseminated intravascular coagulation. Serological tests of hepatitis B, C and HIV were negative. Immunological markers (anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies, anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, beta 2 glycoprotein-I) and serological tests on Hantaan virus were negative. Escherichia coli serotype O:157 was isolated from the coproculture. Flow cytometry showed a decreased concentration of lymphocytes to less than 1% of the lower limit. Cytotoxic activation of lymphocytes was very extensive. One half of B lymphocytes were unresponsive (without CD21). The amount of B cells was appropriate. With the potential diagnosis of STEC-HUS the patient started with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). After the second TPE she developed an epileptic status with tonic clonic convulsions. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, was transitionally intubated and mechanically ventilated. CT of head excluded any other reason for consciousness disorder and neurological symptomatology. After the treatment with a total of 13 TPE, her clinical status clearly improved. Laboratory parameters completely normalized. She was released without any clinical consequences and according to CVID advised to be monitored by a hematologist. She received infusions of human immunoglobulin intravenously every 3–4weeks. Four months later (in December 2011) in physical examination, we noticed swelling of the parotid glands and generalized lymphadenopathy. Histology of cervical lymph node confirmed large B-cell NHL. Chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, pharmarubicin, vincristine, methylprednisolone (R-CHOP) was started. "
299,S0090-8258(17)30164-6,Primary lymphoma of the female genital tract: An analysis of 697 cases," 2 Material methods A cohort of women was selected from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which incorporates high quality data on primary malignant tumor cases. In the present study, data from 18 cancer registries were included (Detroit, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Utah, Connecticut, New Jersey, Atlanta, Rural and Greater Georgia, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Los Angeles, New Mexico, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle), as released on April 2014 . These cancer registries cover approximately 27.8% of the total US population based on the 2010 census [16]. Patient data drawn from the SEER database are de-identified and available to the public for research purposes. The present study was also deemed exempt from IRB review. ICD-O-3 histological (9590/3–9729/3) and topographical (C.51–C.57) codes were employed to identify cases of primary lymphoma arising from the female genital tract [17]. Cases without active follow-up (diagnosed from autopsy or death records) and those without histological and/or cytological confirmation were excluded. In addition, cases diagnosed prior to 1983 were excluded due to unavailability of staging information according to the Ann Arbor system currently employed for staging extranodal lymphoma [10]. Using the “case-listing” option demographic and clinico-pathological parameters and survival data were extracted from the database. No information on the administration of chemotherapy is available in the SEER database. Given that following the introduction of rituximab in 1997, the management of NHL of B-cell subtype changed drastically, year of diagnosis was dichotomized as following (<1997, ?1997) [18]. Based on the ICD-O-3 topographic codes, tumor location was grouped as following: 1) vulva (labium majus, labium minus, clitoris, overlapping lesion of vulva and vulva NOS), 2) vagina, 3) cervix uteri (endocervix, exocervix, overlapping lesion of cervix uteri, and cervix uteri NOS), 4) ovary, 5) uterus (corpus uterus and uterus NOS) and 6) other location (fallopian tube, broad ligament, round ligament, parametrium, uterine adnexa, other parts, female genital tract NOS, overlapping lesion of female genital tract). In the SEER database survival is calculated as the number of months from cancer diagnosis to the date of death. For the estimation of cancer-specific survival (CSS) women who died from causes other than primary lymphoma were censored. Given the indolent course of lymphoma, we opted to exclude from the survival analysis women with a diagnosis of another primary tumor in a different location. In order to determine median and 5-year overall and cancer-specific survival, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and the log-rank test was employed to perform comparisons between different groups. Cox proportional hazard model was constructed to determine independent predictors of cancer-specific mortality. Cases with unavailable information for one or more variables were excluded from the multivariate analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS v.24 statistical package. The alpha level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 and all p-values were two-sided. "
307,S0303-8467(12)00255-7,Turcot's syndrome associated with intestinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: Case report and review of literature," 2 Case report The patient is a 15-year-old boy who presented with stomachache and rectal bleeding. He is the second sibling of the two and there was no history of familial illness or of parental consanguinity. By sigmoidoscopy and colonography (Fig. 1 ), a few small rectal polyps were identified and several polyps in the distal descending colon were excised endoscopically, and histology revealed lower-level tumour-like lesion and tubular adenomas, mild epithelial hyperplasia. The patient later underwent a limited sigmoidectomy, and histology revealed lower-level tumour-like lesion and tubular adenomas, mild and moderate epithelial hyperplasia (Fig. 2 ). He remained well for 5 months until he was admitted for investigation of cephalagia, nausea and vomit. Subsequent CT (Fig. 3 ) of the head revealed a right parieto-occipital lesion. The patient underwent parieto-occipital craniotomy with resection of the mass and histology revealed anaplastic astrocytoma (Fig. 4 ). The patient received a course of radical radiotherapy (60Gys in 30 fractions), accompanied with oral steroids and cytotoxic chemotherapy (oral Temodal 6 cycles for 42 days, 75mg/m2). He made a good recovery and had no further neurological sequelae. Serial MRI brain scans showed no further change. Three months later he was admitted again due to rectal bleeding and a left hemicolectomy was performed, and histology revealed high-level tumour-like lesion and tubular adenomas, moderate to severe epithelial hyperplasia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (Fig. 5 ). The patient received a standard chemotherapy of CHOP regimen (CTX, 750mg/m2, ADR, 40mg/m2, VCR, 1.4mg/m2, iv. for the 1st and 8th days, prednisone 60mg, po.1st to 14th days, 28days a cycle for 6 cycles) for the NHL. During the post-operative follow-up of contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 6 ) of the head 2 months later, a cerebella mass was identified. The patient underwent craniotomy with resection of the mass and histology revealed glioblastoma (Fig. 7 ). The patient received a course of cytotoxic chemotherapy (oral temodal 6 cycles for 42 days, 75mg/m2). He made a recovery with no other sequelae except for the emaciation and myelosuppression. He was referred to the regional cancer genetics service for counselling and molecular gene testing. Following initial contact with the service however, he has elected not to pursue gene testing. His siblings have been offered colonoscopic and head MRI surveillance and nothing positive was found. During the years the patient has been followed up by upper and lower endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging at regular intervals (1–3 months). On several occasions he presented with rectal bleeding and small adenomatous polyps have been removed. "
308,S1083-3188(18)30313-9,Burkitt Lymphoma Presenting as Menorrhagia and a Vaginal Mass in an Adolescent," Case An otherwise healthy 15-year-old adolescent presented with new onset heavy vaginal bleeding. The patient had previously had regular menses occurring every 4 weeks; however, for the 6 weeks before presentation she experienced heavy bleeding every 2 weeks. An oral contraceptive was started with some initial improvement in bleeding. She then returned to the hospital 2 weeks later passing large clots, at which point her oral contraceptive pills were titrated to be taken every 8 hours for 1 day and then tapered down to daily. This initially improved symptoms; however, her heavy bleeding recurred and she became anemic with a decrease in her hemoglobin from 13.7 g/dL to 8 g/dL. Because of her decrease in hemoglobin, she was admitted to hospital, and again her oral contraceptive pill was increased to 3 times a day with improvement in her bleeding. Of note, the patient had 2 pelvic ultrasound examinations within the past 6 months before the development of any heavy bleeding for a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst that had resolved and no evidence of uterine/vaginal/cervical mass was noted on these images. Her vaginal bleeding during this admission was thought to be secondary to anovulatory cycles. One month later, the patient presented to the emergency department with heavy bleeding in the setting of tapering off oral contraceptive pills. She was found to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and anemic with a hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and blood transfusion. She again stabilized with high-dose oral contraceptive pills and was discharged home. She then returned to care 3 weeks after this admission with continued heavy vaginal bleeding and a pelvic ultrasound was obtained after gynecologic consultation. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a new well circumscribed, heterogeneously hypoechoic and hyperemic mass measuring approximately 8.0 × 8.0 × 7.1 cm at the level of the cervix and protruding into the vagina, which was highly concerning for a solid tumor (Fig. 1 ). The patient had never had a pelvic exam during her presentations because of her age. The patient was taken to the operating room for an exam under anesthesia and excisional biopsy of the distal portion of the vaginal mass. Rectal exam revealed a large, firm, 8-cm vaginal mass. On speculum exam, there was a large mass filling the vagina, with the apex of the mass unreachable on digital exam. A resection of the distal section of the mass was performed with the use of electrocautery to maintain hemostasis. Intraoperative frozen section was obtained, which resulted in a preliminary diagnosis of lymphoma. At the conclusion of the excisional biopsies, the tumor bed was coated with ferrous subsulfate to decrease the risk of postoperative bleeding. Final pathologic review of the specimen revealed a Burkitt lymphoma with a classic CD20 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical positivity, CD10, CD20, and lambda-positive using flow cytometry, and c-MYC rearrangement using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Physical examination was notable for a 3-cm left breast mass that had been growing for 6 weeks, a 0.5-cm left chest wall mass, and multiple small nodules in the right breast. Staging evaluations with neck-pelvis computed tomography scans revealed a 2.4 × 2.1-cm left iliac node, 2.8 × 1.8-cm left breast mass, and multiple smaller nodules in both breasts as well as one 8.4 × 8.2-cm vaginal mass. A whole-body positron emission tomography scan showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in a large heterogeneous mass in the vagina, multiple foci in bilateral breasts, soft tissues of the anterior chest wall, bilateral iliac chain lymph nodes, and diffuse uptake in the bone. Bilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed 5%-10% marrow involvement with lymphoma. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for disease. A discussion of surgical resection was had with the patient and her family for bleeding control. After multidisciplinary meetings, surgical resection was not believed to be necessary because Burkitt lymphoma is usually highly response to chemotherapy. She started treatment as per the French-American-British/Lymphomes Malins B backbone therapy for treatment with the additional use of rituximab. 8–10  After 1 cycle of reduction therapy with low-dose cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone, repeat imaging on day 8 showed a decrease in the size of the vaginal mass to 5.8 × 5.4 × 5.7 cm with resolution of the necrotic-appearing iliac node and breast mass. A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of lymphoma. Vaginal bleeding resolved by day 5 of treatment. She then received 2 induction cycles with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate and 1 consolidation cycle with rituximab, cytarabine, and high-dose methotrexate. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography scans to assess for remission were performed 10 weeks after beginning chemotherapy showed a residual cervical/vaginal mass measuring 3 × 4 cm with fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. On the basis of imaging it was difficult to discern if this mass represented necrotic residual tissue vs active lymphoma. Therefore, the patient underwent another exam under anesthesia with distal mass excision of 1.5-cm of visible tumor arising from the cervix. The final biopsy pathology showed no active lymphoma cells with only necrotic tissue and inflammatory infiltrate. The patient then received a final planned cycle of rituximab, cytarabine, and high-dose methotrexate to complete her chemotherapy. She has remained without evidence of disease in the 3 months since completion of treatment. "
312,S0732-8893(12)00388-4,Pulmonary infection due to Pseudozyma aphidis in a patient with burkitt lymphoma: first case report," 2 Case report A 17-year-old man treated with chemotherapeutics for Burkitt lymphoma was hospitalized in a public pediatric oncology center in Recife, Brazil. The patient used in chemotherapy treatment cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and predinisone. After the initiation of chemotherapy, the patient presented a persistent severe febrile neutropenia (neutrophil counts <100/mm3). Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole (Pfizer, São Paulo, Brazil) (400 mg/day) for 15 days and, afterwards, with caspofungin (Merck Research Laboratories, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) (0.5 mg/day) for 23 days were stated. After 38 days of hospitalization and chemotherapy treatment, the neutropenic patient developed fever as high as 39 °C, cough, bloody sputum, and a chest X-ray–detected bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusion. The hemogram counts were 80/mm3 for neutrophils and 29,000/mm3 for platelets. Caspofungin therapy was suspended. Blood cultures were collected for the bacteriologic diagnosis; however, all were negatives. After the symptoms worsened, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of the same hospital with respiratory insufficiency due to a probable pulmonary infection. Venous blood samples were collected aseptically from the central and peripheral veins by venipuncture, and 3 samples of pleural fluid were aseptically collected via thoracentesis. The samples were processed immediately after collection by standard methods of mycologic diagnosis (direct examination and culture). Microbiological identification was achieved using traditional taxonomy according to the criteria described by Barnett et al. (2000) and Boekhout and Fell (1998), through the VITEK 2 system (BioMerieux, Brazil) and by sequencing fragments of the internal transcribed spacer region of the rDNA using the primers ITS-1 and ITS-4 (Gonçalves et al., 2012). Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 document (CLSI, 2008). The antifungal drugs liposomal amphotericin B (AMB; United Medical, São Paulo, Brazil), anidulafungin (ANI; Pfizer), caspofungin (CAS; Caspofungin MSD, Merck), fluconazole (FLZ; (Pfizer), itraconazole (ITZ; Janssen, Titusville, NJ, USA), and voriconazole (VRZ; Pfizer) were tested. The quality control was performed by testing CLSI-recommended strain C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019. Blood cultures were negative. The direct examinations of the pleural fluid showed various hyaline blastoconidia, and the cultures after 7 days of growth at 30 °C and 37 °C on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Difco; BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) media, showed moist yeast colonies, brownish yellow and wrinkled in all samples. Microscopic examination of the culture showed elongated spindle-shaped blastoconidia (see Fig. 1 ). The organism was positive for urea hydrolysis and for assimilation of galactose, d-xylose, d-arabinose, sucrose, lactose, Me?-d-glucoside, maltose, raffinose, soluble starch, trehalose, and nitrate, and was negative for assimilation of cellobiose and inulin. According to these morphologic and biochemical characteristics, this isolate was identified with P. aphidis. The VITEK 2 system showed the same assimilation profile described by Barnett et al. (2000) for P. aphidis. A BLAST search produced a 100% match between the P. aphidis ITS rDNA sequences in the GenBank database. The DNA sequence was submitted to GenBank with the accession number of JQ743064. The isolate was submitted to a stock collection of the Department of Mycology, Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil, with record number 6351. The antifungal susceptibility test showed MIC values of 0.25 ?g/mL for AMB, 4.0 ?g/mL for ANI, 4.0 ?g/mL for CAS, 4.0 ?g/mL for FLZ, 0.25 ?g/mL for ITZ, and 0.03 ?g/mL for VRZ. Thus based on MIC values presented in the document M27-A3 for other yeasts, the isolate was susceptible to AMB, FLZ, ITZ, and VRZ, and resistant to ANI and CAS. Accordingly, the patient was treated with a 10-day course of intravenous amphotericin B lipid complex (Bagó, Brazil) (5 mg/kg per day) and, afterwards, with a 15-day course of oral voriconazole (Pfizer) (400 mg/day). This antifungal therapy resulted in a successful clinical improvement as verified by chest X-ray and the absence of clinical manifestations. "
313,S0303-8467(12)00622-1,"Cervix carcinoma or Burkitt lymphoma metastases in meningiomas, two case reports"," 2 Discussion Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix can spread by local extension, through lymphatics to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and hematogenously to distant organs. The most common sites of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix are lung, liver, bones, and supraclavicular lymph nodes [2]. Metastases of cervical carcinomas to the central nervous system are uncommon and metastasis to another primary brain tumor, meningioma, was described only once in 1977 [1]. The development of brain metastases depends on several factors such as tissue neovascularization, immune status of the host, and characteristics of the tumor [3]. Brain metastases occur more frequently with poorly differentiated carcinomas, as in our first case. In addition to being the most common benign intracranial tumor, some meningiomas express hormone receptors and have increased vascularity making them a good potential target for metastases. Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that predominantly occurs in childhood and is usually multifocal at presentation. It can manifest as lymphoma or leukemia. Epstein–Barr virus positivity is frequently demonstrated in Africa and in HIV-associated immunodeficiency (endemic form). In contrast, the sporadic form usually occurs in adults. It has a weaker association with Epstein–Barr virus and has a propensity for extranodal sites of involvement such as gastrointestinal tract, abdominal viscera, and soft tissue. Burkitt lymphoma has a high proliferation index (Ki-67) and responds well to radiation and chemotherapy. Here, we present the first case, to our knowledge, of Burkitt lymphoma involving a meningioma. Collision tumors represent a rare example of two different primary tumors colliding and forming a single lesion. There are multiple reports of collision tumors of various histologic origins. The central nervous system is an unusual location for them. However, meningiomas have been reported to represent one of the more common locations for these collision tumors. This may be due to the receptor status of meningiomas. It is well known that meningiomas can express estrogen and progesterone receptors [4]. In our two cases, the meningiomas demonstrated strong expression of progesterone and weak expression of estrogen receptors. Breast carcinoma, which represents one of the most common primary sites for metastatic carcinoma to a meningioma, also frequently expresses hormone receptors such as estrogen and progesterone. Thus, hormone receptor expression could provide a unique microenvironment for metastatic cancer cells. A second factor that potentially makes a meningioma a favorable location for metastases is its vascularity. There are multiple studies addressing increased vascularity and angiogenesis in meningiomas [4]. In our two cases the meningioma component had strong vascularity highlighted by CD 31. As a rule, tumor cells need a well vascularized and nutritionally supplied tissue to proliferate. Thus, strong vascularity of meningiomas could create a good environment for metastases. In conclusion, we report two cases, Burkitt lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma, involving a meningioma, the former of which has never been reported. Knowledge of the patient's history is crucial in order to diagnose surgical specimens. The practicing pathologist should be aware if there is a previous history of malignancy when examining meningiomas, there can be unanticipated findings as has been demonstrated. Extensive tissue sections should be taken so as to increase the likelihood of finding possible metastatic disease. "

325,S0150-9861(11)00040-X,Primary diffuse choroid plexus T-cell lymphoma: Case report," Case report A 63-year-old woman presented with postictal unconsciousness. It was the first seizure in her entire life, and she had been complaining of progressively worsening headaches and dizziness for one week. Her medical history contained no evidence of immunodeficiency, nor were there any clinical or laboratory signs of immunological involvement. As computed tomography (CT) had revealed enhanced masses within all ventricles along with tetraventricular hydrocephaly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images revealed high signal intensity around the ventricles suggestive of periventricular edema. T2-weighted MR images showed marked enlargement of reduced intensity of the choroid plexus, while post-contrast T1-weighted MR images showed an intraventricular mass located within the choroid plexus. The lesion extended into the fourth ventricle via the third. Also, the lateral ventricles showed diffuse ependymal enhancement (Fig. 1 ). The patient underwent an urgent operation involving suboccipital craniotomy with a navigation-assisted transvermian approach. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage was performed, and a biopsy to determine the pathology was taken. The lesion was soft in nature and yellowish in color, arising from the choroid plexus and floating inside the ventricle. The histological diagnosis was high-grade diffuse large T-cell lymphoma (Fig. 2 ). Whole-body CT scan showed no systemic involvement, and bone-marrow biopsy was normal. Cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal MRI was also normal. A diagnosis of primary TCNSL was formulated. "

328,S1092-9134(16)30180-0,"Signet-ring cell lymphoma: clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of 7 cases"," 2 Materials and methods Our pathology department archives from 1988 to 2016 for “signet ring cell lymphoma, lymphoma with signet ring cells” were searched. Clinical information and the results of flow cytometric analysis were collected from the medical records. Five cases from 4 patients were identified. Two additional cases were contributed by the collaborating colleagues. This study was approved by the institutional review board of our institute. Immunohistochemical stains were performed at the referring institutions or in the laboratory at Indiana University Health Pathology Laboratory using the prediluted, ready-to-use antibodies (CD3, clone IR503; CD20, IR604; CD10, IR648; BCL2, IR614; BCL6, IR625; Ki-67, IR626; MUM-1, IR644) from Dako (Santa Clara, CA) with a Dako Autostainer Plus instrument following the manufacturer's protocols [18]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed using 4-?m tumor tissue sections that were mounted on positively charged glass slides. An accompanying hematoxylin and eosin slide was reviewed to determine tumor location. Slides were baked at 65°C ± 5°C for 1 hour, deparaffinized in xylene at room temperature, and washed in 100% ethanol and air-dried. Pretreatment included exposure to 0.2 N HCl, followed by 1 M sodium thiocyanate and pepsin at 37°C to digest proteins in the tissue sample. After pepsin treatment, slides were viewed with phase microscopy to ensure adequate digestion of the tumor tissue. Denaturation, ethanol dehydration, and hybridization with the LSI MYC Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement; LSI IGH/MYC, CEP 8 Tri-color Dual Fusion Translocation; LSI BCL6 Break Apart and LSI IGH/BCL2 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) probes were carried out as per manufacturer's instructions. Cells were counterstained with DAPI and observed under a Leica DMRXA2 fluorescence microscope. Two hundred cells were analyzed by 2 readers (100 cells apiece) for each of the 3 probes. Scoring criteria included the selection of single nuclei with representation of at least 1 signal for each color/probe/nucleus. "
333,S2211-338X(12)00082-8,Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma of the cervix: A case report of a rare entity," Case report A 54-year-old healthy female, who has previously underwent subtotal hysterectomy with preservation of the cervix for treatment of uterine fibroids, presented with persistent vaginal bleeding. She has had two satisfactory Pap smears, dating 1 and 4years prior to her presentation, both of which were negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. Pelvic examination revealed a cervical mass. Endocervical curettage and a biopsy were performed and an enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was requested. The scan revealed enlargement of the cervix (Fig. 1(a)), associated with pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pathological examination of the endocervical curettage revealed lymphoid infiltration, consistent with a lymphoma (Fig. 2(a)). Despite the limited evaluation of the specimen due to its small size and fragmented nature, a nodular growth pattern was focally identified (Fig. 2(b)). On high magnification, the lymphoid nodules were populated by benign small lymphocytes, admixed with scattered large abnormal-appearing lymphoid cells with features highly suggestive of lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells (Fig. 3 ). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that these cells were positive for CD20 (Fig. 4(a)), CD45, PAX5, BCL-6, BOB1 (Fig. 4(b)) and OCT2 (Fig. 4(c)). They were dimly positive or negative for CD30; no detectable expression for BCL-2, CD10, or CD3 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) was found. The background T cells were positive for CD3 and CD4, and a subset was positive for CD57. These large cells were rimmed with CD57-positive small T-cells. A good number of CD20-positive small B-cells were also found. Considering the overall morphological and immunophenotypic pattern, the diagnosis was felt to be NLPHL. Considering the unusual clinical presentation, a decision to obtain additional tissue biopsy was made. The repeat biopsy showed lymphoid cells arranged in a vaguely nodular pattern with scattered L&H cells. Rimming with CD3-positive T-cells was again noted (Fig. 4(d)). The remainder of the immunohistochemical studies revealed similar findings to those in the first biopsy. A diagnosis of NLPHL arising in the cervix was conferred.

The remainder of the immunohistochemical studies revealed similar findings to those in the first biopsy. A diagnosis of NLPHL arising in the cervix was conferred. A positron emission tomography (PET)-CT (Fig. 1(b)) revealed abnormal metabolic activity within the cervical mass, left inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) and bilateral common and external iliac LNs. Baseline blood investigations were unremarkable. The patient was designated Stage IIEA based on the Ann Arbour staging system. The treatment plan was discussed by our multidisciplinary lymphoma team and treatment with radiation alone was elected. The patient underwent CT simulation. The gross tumour volume (GTV) was defined as the disease identified on CT and PET-CT. The first clinical target volume (CTV1) included the cervix, para-aortic, bilateral common iliac, external iliac and inguinal LNs. This was treated to 40Gy in 20 fractions using 15MV anterior and posterior photon fields, shielding normal structures when possible. The patient tolerated the treatment well and considerable response to RT was noted after 3weeks, following which she underwent another CT simulation. Residual disease was limited to the cervical remnant and this constituted the CTV2 which was treated to an additional 10Gy using 15 MV photons and a four-field box technique. Toward the end of the treatment, the patient developed grade 2 radiation dermatitis, grade 1 nausea and vomiting and grade 1 diarrhea. The patient was clinically evaluated 2months following the completion of RT when she was found to have recovered from radiation side effects. There was no evidence of residual disease but a 1.5cm necrotic ulcer in the vaginal vault consistent with the site of her previously large malignancy was observed. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis also indicated complete response to radiotherapy. Subsequent evaluation, 5months from RT, showed complete healing of the vaginal ulcer. The patient remains alive and in remission one and a half year since her diagnosis with no significant morbidity. "
334,S0028-3843(14)60369-8,Tuberculosis of the spine masquerading as a spine lymphoma. A case report and discussion of diagnostic and therapeutic traps," Case report A 59-year-old man, a very heavy smoker, began to complain of girdle-like thoraco-lumbar pain. He developed hyperthermia, loss of appetite and loss of body weight, and at 6 weeks from the onset of his symptoms he began to complain of leg weakness. Disability index on the Oswestry Scale was 98% (crippled). He was admitted to the neurosurgical division for investigation and treatment. His laboratory investigation revealed an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 90 mm after one hour. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a glucose level of 30 mg/dL, and increased protein concentration (5 g/L). Histological examination revealed a polymorphic image, i.e. large number of lymphocytes, single macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the involvement of the vertebra, the pedicles of T12 and the intervertebral disc between T12 and L1. There was also a large area of involvement of the surrounding soft tissues (Figs. 1 and 2  ). The oncologists diagnosed an isolated vertebral lymphoma with a very poor prognosis. The patient was put on complete bed rest and over the ensuing weeks received 6 chemotherapeutic interventions and two radiotherapy treatments in the Th 12/L1 area. The clinical condition of the patient showed a sudden and unexpected improvement and the weakness of his lower extremities disappeared. His girdle-like pain also disappeared and he began to walk. His ESR fell to 20 mm after one hour. A repeated lumbar puncture and examination of the CSF showed disappearance of the lymphocytes. New MRI showed a marked decrease of fluid in the disc and adjacent vertebral bodies. At the same time, there was an increase in the destruction of the pedicles and base of the lamina of T12 and L1. The decision was made to continue with the radiotherapy of T12 and L1. The condition of the patient deteriorated. His pain increased and he began to lose weight and he developed an allergic ring-like skin reaction over T12. A third MRI showed a pathological fracture of T12 and L1 with collapse of the vertebrae and the formation of a typical kyphosis with a marked increase in the amount of pus in the soft tissues. These findings suggested a revision of the diagnosis and the attending doctors began to consider tuberculosis as a distinct possibility (Fig. 3 ). At this point, the patient was transferred to the division of bone and joint tuberculosis of the orthopedic department. The diagnosis of tuberculosis of the spine with neurological compromise of the lower extremities was quite clear at this point. The new and appropriate treatment consisted of 10 weeks of complete bed rest and antimycobacterial drug therapy. Antimycobacterial drug therapy included: rifampicin (600 mg/daily for 12 months with ongoing control of liver function), hydrazide (300 mg daily for 12 months), pyrazinamide (1 tablet t.i.d. for 3 months with ongoing monitoring of liver function), and ethambutol (5 capsules daily for 6 months under ophthalmologist surveillance). Obviously, a definite diagnosis of tuberculosis of the spine can be risky, because a similar picture occurs in non-specific inflammation. Antimycobacterial drug therapy applied ex juvantibus and rapid improvement confirmed ongoing tuberculous infection. Within 4 weeks the patient's pain disappeared and his lower extremity function showed marked improvement. The patient was then given a Jewett brace and ambulated. A follow-up at 2 years revealed that he was pain-free and able to walk without limits. His disability score on the Oswestry scale was 16% (minimally disabled) and he scored 9 points on the Rolland-Morris scale. His skin rash had not retreated. An X-ray showed a spontaneous fusion of T12 and L1 (Fig. 4 ). "

In October 2011, a 69-year-old white man presented with 15% weight loss (22kg), mental confusion, nocturnal fever, difficulty in ambulation, limb weakness and general fatigue experienced over the previous 9 months. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly, palpable 3cm below the right costal margin, without lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.  2.1 Investigation The results of the complete blood count were normal apart from mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 13,340/?L). The results of liver function tests were aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 58U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 130U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT): 305U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 601U/L, total bilirubin (TB): 0.7mg/dL and albumin: 3.4g/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was found to be 2648U/L. Results of serologic tests for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and human T-lymphotropic virus-1 were negative. FAN and VDRL were negative. Tumor markers levels are described as follows: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA): 0.3ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19.9): 7.0U/mL, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): 4.58ng/mL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed a hypointense area on T1-weighted images sized of 13cm×9cm×11cm, and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1 a). There was no mediastinal lymphadenopathy or brain involvement on CT scan. Two ultrasonography-guided needle liver biopsies were found negative and the third one showed diffuse infiltration of large sized lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 ): positive CD45-LCA, positive CD20; positive Ki67 in 80% of atypical cells; CD99 positive; vimentin positive. CD3, CD15, CD30, ACT, CK, CRO, DES, HMB45, and S100 were all negative. The diagnosis of primary large cells non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma was made. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy examination showed no evidence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.   2.2 Treatment The patient received R-CHOP treatment (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab) in 8 cycles throughout 12 months. Two sessions of radiotherapy were also implemented.   2.3 Outcome and follow-up In this case report, the patient showed a good response to treatment with mild side effects. After 6 months, the lesion decreased in size to 7cm×5cm (Fig. 1b). After 24 months of follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic. However, imaging studies have shown the persistence of a small calcified lesion of 3cm×1.5cm (Fig. 1c). The patient has been regularly seen in an outpatient facility.  "
337,S1556-3707(12)00078-8,Metastatic non-Hodgkin lymphoma presenting as low back pain and radiculopathy: a case report," Case report A 46-year-old man was seeking chiropractic care for LBP on the right side, which radiated down to the midthigh and sometimes into the lower leg. No numbness, tingling, cramping, or burning sensations were reported. The pain had been present for 2 weeks and was getting worse. He reported that he was very stiff in the morning for about 10 to 15 minutes until he began moving. The pain was achy all day and scored as 6 to 7 of 10 on a numeric pain scale. The pain was aggravated by lifting heavy objects at work and transitioning from sitting to standing. The patient gave consent to have his personal health information published without divulging personal identifiers. Orthopedic and chiropractic examination procedures revealed restricted intersegmental motion with pain from L4 to S1 on all movements with a pain level of 6 to 7 of 10. Results of Straight Leg Raise, Braggard, Kemp, and Patrick FABERE tests were positive for LBP at a pain level of 7 to 8 of 10 with radiation to the right leg down to midthigh. Result of Valsalva test was positive with a pain level of 6 to 7 of 10. Results of muscle, sensory, and reflex testing were all normal. The patient reported that he was otherwise in good health. His vital signs were within normal limits; and there were no signs or history of weight loss, wasting, or other chronic, systemic disorder. The initial working diagnosis was sciatica with strain/sprain and muscle spasm. He was treated with chiropractic care consisting of spinal manipulation to improve spinal motion and reduce pain intermittently over 4 months. By the end of the 4-month period, the patient reported that the LBP was 2 of 10. During the fifth month, the patient presented with LBP that radiated into his right leg; but this time, the pain was of a higher intensity. He stated that this pain came on suddenly while straining during a bowel movement. His pain was worse in the morning (8/10) and remained achy all day. The pain interfered with his work, which required lifting heavy objects. The LBP was constant with no reported relieving factors. The leg pain was relieved by rest and lying down. No sphincter or bladder disturbances were reported. A reexamination found positive results in the Straight Leg Raise test, Well Leg Raise test, Braggard test, and Kemp test, all with radicular pain down the right leg. Result of Valsalva test was positive. Deep tendon reflexes were equal bilaterally. No muscle weakness was evident. An area of numbness was noted over the left and right hips, corresponding to the L1-L2 dermatomes. A working diagnosis of disk herniation was made, and the patient was referred for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lumbar spine. Magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed thecal sac and cauda equina compression at the L1 and L4 levels due to destruction and collapse of the L1 and L4 vertebrae with posterior extension of a soft tissue mass (Figs 1 and 2  ). There was destruction of the L1 and L4 anterior vertebral cortices with anterior extension of a soft tissue mass (Fig 3 ). In addition, suspicious high-signal lesions were noted in T12 and S2 on the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence (Fig 4 ), which was not readily appreciated on the T2-weighted image (Fig 2). The differential diagnoses included spinal metastasis of unknown origin, primary or metastatic lymphoma, multiple myeloma, tuberculosis/Pott disease, infection, and epidural abscess. The patient was referred for an immediate consultation with his medical physician with the preliminary diagnosis of metastatic bone lesions or primary bone lesions of unknown etiology. The patient underwent bone biopsy, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography scanning. The biopsy revealed small cell NHL. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography scanning showed metastasis in the lung and liver. Chemotherapy and radiation were administered for 4 days followed by chemotherapy for 6 months. The patient has been in remission for 18 months. "

No finger tremor or other symptoms related to Graves' disease were reported on the clinical findings. Ultrasonography revealed ahypoechoic area in the right upper lobe of thyroid and favored multinodular goiters initially, and fine-needle aspiration cytology showed lymphoma. Gallium-67 whole-body scintigraphy showed active gallium-avid lesions involving the anterior aspect of the neck, mediastinum, bilateral lung hilar regions, and lower portion of left chest. Bone marrow examination revealed nearly normal marrow with increased lymphocytes in focal areas; bone marrow involvement was suspected. After total thyroidectomy and neck lymph node dissection, results of histological examination, immunohistochemical analysis, and flow cytometric analysis confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (pathological stage IE) (Figs. 1A–1C). The patient received radiation therapy, a total dose of 4680 cGy to mediastinum and 5220 cGy to tumor bed, and chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone).

He had speech and breathing difficulties. Diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) was made according to standard histological and immunohistochemical examinations of the excised lymph nodes on 10th October 2010. He was planned for six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, oncovin (vincristine) and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy which included intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (IV, 750mg/m2), doxorubicin (IV, 50mg/m2), and oncovin (vincristine) (IV, 1.4mg) for 1day, and prednisone (oral, 100mg) for 5days for every 21days. Prior to the first cycle, the patient was given dexamethasone (IV, 8mg) every 8hours for rapid reduction of the neck mass. He tolerated the first cycle of chemotherapy infusions well on 1st November 2010 and was discharged for daily prophylactic granulocytes colony stimulating factor (GCSF) in the day care center. The patient had two episodes of mild and self-limiting diarrhea about a week after the first cycle of chemotherapy. This was thought to be associated with GCSF since the diarrhea ceased after the treatment was stopped. On 2nd December 2010, the following week after his second cycle chemotherapy, he became tired and was noted to be pale. The total white blood cells count was 32.2×109/L with increased absolute neutrophil and eosinophil counts of 30.05×109/L and 1.40×109/L, respectively. Serum from blood sample was tested for the presence of S. stercoralis-specific antibodies including IgG (Strong-96 ELISA, IVD, USA), IgG4, and IgE. The latter two were laboratory-based ELISAs using S. stercoralis larvae lysate. The serological results for anti-Strongyloides IgG and IgG4 antibodies were positive, but the IgE-ELISA was negative. Blood and stool samples were sent on 6th December 2010 for culture and microscopic examination. The blood culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae and was found to be sensitive for amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. Parasitological diagnosis was performed by microscopic examination of direct fecal smear, which showed one to three S. stercoralis larvae per low power field (10× magnification). This was subsequently confirmed by a strong positive result by real-time polymerase chain reaction using Strongyloides primers and probe based on a previous protocol from our group [12]. A low Ct value of 26.77 was obtained (positive Ct <40.0) which indicated presence of substantial amount of Strongyloides DNA in the sample. No investigation for the presence of Strongyloides larvae in other clinical specimens was made. The patient was treated with albendazole (oral, 400mg/day) for 3days and tazocin (IV, 4.5g every 6hours) for 5days. Unfortunately, despite the treatment, the patient succumbed following multiorgan failure on 9th December 2010. "

All patients in whom the diagnosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, was confirmed on histology and immunohistochemistry were included in this study and all histological slides labelled as midline granuloma were systematically reviewed. All information available in medical files, including epidemiological and clinical data results of complementary investigations and treatment modalities, was collected and analysed. The mean follow-up of this series was 13.6 months (range: 2–62 months). "
349,S0046-8177(16)30179-4,Double-hit follicular lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations: a study of 7 cases with a review of literature," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case selection The database of our institution was searched for cases of FL associated with MYC/8q24 rearrangement and IGH@BCL2/t(14;18)(q32;q21) from January 2006 to February 2016. The presence of translocations was confirmed by conventional cytogenetic and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Three cases had been reported in a previous study from our institution as a part of a larger study on DHL [18,19]. Each case was diagnosed and classified using the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [20,21]. The corresponding medical records were reviewed to obtain clinical data, including age, sex, sites of involvement, tumor stage at diagnosis, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, treatment regimens, response to therapy, and follow-up data. This study was approved by the internal review board of our institution.   2.2 Immunophenotyping Immunohistochemical studies were performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections either at the time of diagnosis or retrospectively for this study. After deparaffinization and dehydration of the sections in graded alcohols and xylene, endogenous peroxidase was blocked with hydrogen peroxide. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed using citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The panel of monoclonal antibodies used in this study included: CD3 (rabbit polyclonal), CD5 (clone 4C7), CD10 (clone 56C6), CD20 (clone L26), BCL2 (clone 124), BCL6 (clone PG-B6p), and Ki-67 (clone MIB-1) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and MYC (clone Y69; Ventana, Tucson, AZ).   2.3 Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis FISH was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections according to the manufacturer's protocols. FISH probes used in this study were all obtained from the same commercial source (Abbott Molecular, Downers Grove, IL) and included the following: LSI C-MYC dual-color, break-apart rearrangement probe; LSI IGH@BCL2 dual-color, dual-fusion translocation or LSI BCL2 dual-color, break-apart rearrangement probes; and LSI BCL6 dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe. A total of 200 interphase nuclei were analyzed for each probe. Most cases of low-grade FL were analyzed for MYC rearrangement by FISH at the outside institutions. Cases that were analyzed in our institution usually had a grade 3 component or a high Ki-67 rate.  "
351,S0303-8467(12)00274-0,Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the skull base: A case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 15-year-old boy presented to our department complaining of protrusion of the right eye for 1 month. His personal medical history was uneventful. A physical examination identified only a slight exophthalmos of the right eye without any other significant findings. Laboratory tests, including haematology and endocrinology, were normal. CT scans revealed a huge clivus lesion extending towards the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone, the right orbital apex and the nasal cavities with extensive bone destruction. MRI demonstrated a mass with iso-signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images and intense enhancement after gadolinium administration (Fig. 1 ). The preoperative diagnosis was an invasive meningioma. As the tumour had intruded into the sphenoidal sinus and destroyed the clivus bone, we chose a trans-sphenoidal tissue biopsy as the first diagnostic procedure. The intraoperative frozen pathology revealed a small-cell malignant tumour. The final pathology was consistent with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including positive LCA, CD45RO, CD20 and CD79a staining and negative CD3 staining by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 ). No other systemic manifestations of the disease were found through CT examinations of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and a bone marrow aspiration. Therefore, the final diagnosis was primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the skull base. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient's right-eye protrusion remained unchanged. The patient received 6 cycles of high-dose methotrexate (MTX, 3g/m2) systemic chemotherapy in our department. A dramatic recovery of the exophthalmos was observed just after the second treatment cycle. MRI investigations 2 months after completion of the chemotherapy treatment showed a considerable remission of the mass, with remarkable decompressions of the right eyeball and the brainstem (Fig. 3 ). Neither radiotherapy nor further chemotherapy, including cortisone administration, was received as adjuvant treatment. MRI performed 6 months later demonstrated that the lesion remained stable. At the time of publication, approximately 12 months after the final diagnosis, the patient had resumed his classes and a normal life. "
359,S1877-7821(13)00029-5,Occupational exposure to immunologically active agents and risk for lymphoma: The European Epilymph case–control study," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study design and participants The Epilymph study is a multicenter case–control study including populations from 6 European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland, France and Czech Republic). Newly diagnosed cases of lymphoid neoplasms and controls were recruited from 1998 to 2004 using a common core protocol and interview in all countries. The diagnosis of lymphoma was verified by histology and 99% of them were supplemented by immunohistochemistry test and flow cytometry. Cases were categorized according to the WHO Classification for Neoplastic Diseases of the Lymphoid Tissues [18]. Subjects with a diagnosis of uncertain malignant potential such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder or monoclonal gammapathies of undetermined significance were excluded. Controls were identified at same time as the diagnosis of the cases and were sampled from the general population based on census lists in Italy and Germany matched by age and sex. In the other 4 countries, controls were recruited from the same hospital as the cases and were frequency matched to cases by age, gender, and hospital. Individuals with organ transplantation, HIV or a diagnosis of a systemic infection were excluded by protocol [19,20]; for our study, controls hospitalized due to respiratory diseases were also excluded. We further excluded subjects who reported to have never worked. Finally, the study includes 2205 lymphoma cases and 2296 controls with complete information of the exposure and adjustment variables (Fig. 1 ). Informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance to guidelines from the institutional review boards of the participating institutes.   2.2 Questionnaire and occupational history Information was requested through a structured face-to-face interview. The same structured questionnaire was used and translated into the local language in each country. Questions collected information on socio-demographic factors, reproductive, familial and medical history including allergies and asthma, residence, tobacco, alcohol and drugs consumption, use of hair dyes, sunlight exposure and complete occupational history. Lifetime occupational history was recorded including all jobs held for at least one year including a job and industry description and start and end years.   2.3 Occupational exposure assessment Occupations were coded in each country using the 1968 International Labour Office International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-68) [21]. ISCO-68 uses a five-digit hierarchical system that classifies jobs into 1506 occupational titles and is published in English, French, and Spanish. Codes of all jobs for each participant were linked to an asthma-specific job exposure matrix (OAJEM) that had been adapted to the ISCO-68 coding system [15]. The OAJEM includes protein exposures such as latex, flour, biological enzymes and mites that are known to produce asthma through an IgE mediated mechanism [13]. In addition, the OAJEM also assigns exposure to other recognized occupational risk factors for asthma. Each matrix cell contains a yes or no indication of exposure, favouring specificity over sensitivity as jobs are classified as exposed only if the probability of exposure is expected to be high for a considerable number of subjects in that job. Seven of the protein-derived HMW included in the OAJEM are agents causing sensitization through an IgE-mediated mechanism. These agents are classified in a hierarchical scheme with some specific allergens nested in the larger groups: latex, flour, other plant antigens (derived from plants); rodents and livestock, fish and shellfish (derived from animals); arthropods or mites; and bioaerosols. These agents are known to produce asthma through an IgE mediated mechanism. The OAJEM also evaluates low molecular weight agents that include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds that have not been consistently associated with an IgE-mediated mechanism such as isocyanates, metal fumes and wood dusts, bioaerosols including moulds and endotoxins and four mixed environments that have been associated with asthma (metal working fluids, textile and agricultural settings). Finally, the OAJEM includes three wide groups of (mainly irritating) agents that may be considered low risk factors for (occupational) asthma. Estimates of exposure to asthma causing agents were derived for each job held by study subjects and individual indices of exposure were created by integration over the whole occupational history of each case and control. Exposed individuals were defined taking into account 5 years of lag for high molecular weight exposures; for cases, exposures occurring in the last 5 years before the diagnosis were not considered, for controls, the lag was based on the interview date. We calculated the duration of occupational exposure using the total time of exposure among jobs excluding the 5 years previous to the date of diagnosis/interview. A five-year exposure lag was applied under the assumption that very recent exposures cannot be the causes of the lymphoma.   2.4 Statistical analysis Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the risk of lymphoma in relation to ever exposure to high molecular weight agents. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all lymphomas and lymphoma subtypes were estimated adjusting for age (in quartiles), sex and study centre. Alternative analysis was done with further adjustment for potential confounders, we estimated the risk of lymphoma including educational level (as marker of socioeconomic status), smoking, and also other occupational exposures evaluated by the matrix (low risk exposures and other high risk exposures as low molecular weight, mixed exposures, bioaerosols, drugs, and irritants). Specific allergens exposure was evaluated for all lymphomas and B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. In order to assess the duration-response relationship, we evaluated cumulative years of exposure to high molecular weight agents during occupational history. Generalized additive models (GAM) were applied to exposed individuals to examine the linearity of the duration-response effect; since the relationship was non-linear, we analyzed duration of exposure using years of exposure dichotomized at the median (8 years) for exposed individuals. Several sensitivity analyses were done. To ensure that the estimates were not affected by excluding exposures occurred in the last 5 years, we performed an additional analysis excluding those individuals that had been exposed only in the 5 previous years to diagnosis or interview. We also estimated the risk of lymphoma without taking into account the 5 year lag assumption, and additionally we tested a ten-year exposure lag. For Hodgkin lymphoma, we randomized a 1:1 matched case–control and applied conditional logistic regression to asses the impact of the unequal distribution of age between Hodgkin lymphoma cases and controls; for this analysis, controls were matched to Hodgkin cases by centre, age and sex. To make sure that the risk estimates were robust and not dependent on a specific country, we evaluated the risk of lymphoma excluding the countries one by one. Furthermore, we tested the interaction between country and exposure to HMW agents through likelihood-ratio test and evaluated also the heterogeneity between country-specific estimates using I-squared measure [22]. As countries did not present heterogeneity, neither interaction between country and exposure was found, we present the results of the pooled analyses. Effect modification by asthma was assessed through a stratified analysis by asthma status and also using likelihood-ratio test comparing models with additive and interaction terms. The level of significance was set at 0.05 and all tests were two-sided. All analyses were performed using statistical package Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA).  "
361,S2213-0071(17)30083-7,A case of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma of lung presenting with progressive multiple nodules on chest computed tomography," 2 Case report A 71-year-old man visited our hospital for a second opinion on his worsening dyspnea, recurrent for more than 6 months. 6 months ago, he had started to present dyspnea on exertion, which eventually worsened; he was admitted at a tertiary hospital. At the hospital, pulmonary function test results were normal except for the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, at 22.4 mL/mmHg/min (29%). Chest CT showed diffuse GGOs in the both lungs and consolidation at the left lower lobe (Fig. 1 A). Echocardiography showed a mildly thickened left ventricle wall and moderate resting pulmonary hypertension (The maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity 3.6m/sec). Heart biopsy was done to rule out amyloidosis, which came out negative. Bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (BAL) procedure was carried out; the fluid cell count included a total of 640 white blood cells, 64% alveolar macrophages, 12% neutrophils, and 24% lymphocytes. Additionally BAL culture provided no definite finding, as no pathogens were detected, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nontuberculosis mycobacteria. Transbronchial lung biopsy was not performed because of hypoxemia during the examination. These results, supplemented by others, prompted his attending physician at that hospital to explain to the patient that he was diagnosed as having suspected cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Thus, the attending physician decided to treat him with 50 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone, as an empirical therapy. Initially, therapy was effective; however, upon gradual tapering of the steroid, recurrence of dyspnea on exertion occurred. Upon conducting a follow-up chest CT scan, newly developed multiple nodules were found to have been superimposed on GGOs in the both lungs (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, the patient visited our hospital for further evaluation and management of the worsening dyspnea. The patient had type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, a duodenal ulcer, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient stated that before the dyspnea occurred, he had smoked 15 cigarettes per day for 50 years, totally 37.5 pack years. His family history and alcohol history were nonspecific. His vital signs showed blood pressure of 110 mmHg over 70 mmHg, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and body temperature of 36.4 °C. His lung sounds were diffusely coarse in both sides. He had no cervical neck vein engorgement, organomegaly, or palpable mass. In laboratory examinations, he had a white blood cell count of 5990/mm3 of blood (neutrophil 80.9%), hemoglobin concentration of 11.8 g/dL, platelet count of 71,000/mm3, 306 mOsm/kg serum osmorality, 128 mEq/L sodium, 4.1 mEq/L potassium, 97 mEq/L chloride, 3.6 g/dL total protein, 2.1 g/dL albumin, 566 mg/dL glucose, 0.5 mg/dL total bilirubin, 28 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 1.4 mg/dL creatinine, 32 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase, 31 IU/L alanine transaminase, 1.9 mg/L c-reactive protein, and 1707 IU/L LDH. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.41, PaCO2 25 mmHg, PaO2 61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation level was 96% at receiving oxygen 3L/min via nasal prong. Upon review of sequential chest CT at the previous hospital (Fig. 1) and high LDH level, we decided to perform SLB through VATS. On hematoxylin and eosin staining, pulmonary interstitium was filled with several atypical lymphocytes in the capillaries (Fig. 2 ). Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells were positive for CD20 (Fig. 3 ) and negative for CD3, S-100, HMB45, Pan-CK, CEA and CD31. Finally he was diagnosed as IVLBCL of lung. We referred him to Seoul St. Mary's hospital. Before treatment, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was done as a baseline study. We found no abnormal 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lesion (Fig. 4 ). Thus, we could confirm him as IVLBCL of lung without any other organic involvement. He was treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy for six cycles. One month later, he came back to the outpatient clinic of the hematology of Seoul St. Mary's hospital after completion of the chemotherapy. He said that he could climb mountain just like a few years ago and had no dyspnea at all. His lung sounds were clear without crackles. In laboratory examinations, he had a white blood cell count of 15,770/mm3 of blood (neutrophil 81.0%), hemoglobin concentration of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 281,000/mm3, 26.0 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 1.24 mg/dL creatinine, and 726 IU/L LDH. In radiologic findings, the comparison of sequential chest CT images before and after R-CHOP treatment were also compatible with complete remission of IVLBCL (Fig. 5 ). He went back home looking forward to his next visit to the hospital. "
367,S1476-5586(16)00024-5,Complex Chromosomal Rearrangements in B-Cell Lymphoma: Evidence of Chromoanagenesis? A Case Report," Material and Methods  Case Report A 59-year-old Caucasian woman with history of hypothyroidism presented to the clinic with rapidly enlarging goiter causing significant dyspnea. She noticed swelling in the neck 2 months before presenting to the clinic. A computed tomographic scan showed extensive infiltration and enlargement of the thyroid gland with significant effect on the trachea, limited to 4.3 mm in width at the thoracic inlet. Thyroid biopsy showed sheets of large dysplastic B-cells, diagnostic of DLBCL. The neoplastic B-cells expressed CD10, BCL6, MUM1, and BCL2 and lacked expression of CD30, Cyclin D1, and EBER. Flow cytometric analysis also showed the clonal B-cells (45% of total cells) expressed CD19, CD20, and surface lambda light chain and lacked CD45. Background nodular follicular dendritic meshwork (CD21+) suggested that the DLBCL may have arisen from FL. Bone marrow biopsy was normal and unremarkable.   Chromosome Analysis Cytogenetic analysis was carried out on biopsy tissue. Culture initiation, maintenance, and harvest were done using standard methods [18]. Chromosomes were G-banded [19] and then analyzed using a Cytovision image analysis system (Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, CA).   Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) FISH was performed on the cultured biopsy specimen using directly labeled break-apart probe BCL6 (5’ labeled in spectrum orange and 3’ in spectrum green); dual-color, dual-fusion translocation probe IGH/BCL2 (IGH labeled in spectrum green and BCL2 in spectrum orange); and whole chromosome paint probes for chromosomes 7 (labeled in spectrum green), 14 (spectrum orange), and 12 (spectrum green) (Cytocell, Windsor, CT). The probes were hybridized to interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes using standard procedures, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and then analyzed using a Cytovision image analysis system (Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, CA). For interphase analysis, a minimum of 100 nuclei were scored, and for metaphase analysis, a minimum of 10 metaphases were scored.   Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Oligonucleotide Microarray Given the complex nature of the abnormalities observed, chromosome microarray studies were carried out using Affymetrix CytoScan HD microarray. The Affymetrix CytoScan HD Assay uses a high density combined CGH and SNP array platform, which assesses approximately 2,696,550 markers, including approximately 750,000 SNP markers. Each oligonucleotide is approximately 25 bp long. Intragenic probe spacing is approximately 1 probe every 880 bp, and intergenic probe spacing is approximately 1 probe every 1700 bp. To perform the assay, gDNA is digested with the Nsp1 restriction enzyme and digested DNA is then ligated to Nsp1 adapters. The ligation product is then amplified via polymerase chain reaction to produce amplicons in the 200- to 1100-bp range. The amplicons are then purified and digested with DNAse I to produce 25- to 125-bp fragments. The fragments are end-labeled with a modified biotinylated base, and the sample is then hybridized to the array. The array is washed and then stained with a streptavidin-coupled dye and a biotinylated antistreptavidin antibody. The array is then scanned with the GeneChip Scanner, and the signal intensity for each marker is assessed. Using the Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAs 3.0) software, the signal for the sample is then compared with a reference set, which is based on the average of more than 400 samples. Differences in signal between the sample and reference are expressed as a log2 ratio and represent relative intensity for each marker. A discrete copy number value is determined from the relative intensity data and is displayed. Genotype information for the SNP markers is visualized with the Allele Track [20].  "
368,S0046-8177(16)30099-5,Burkitt lymphoma presenting as a mass in the thyroid gland: a clinicopathologic study of 7 cases and review of the literature," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case selection and patient population We searched our hospital databases for patients diagnosed with aggressive B-cell lymphoma involving the thyroid gland between 2000 and 2015. A retrospective review of the clinical and laboratory data was performed in accordance with an institutional review board–approved protocol. Cases meeting 2008 World Health Organization criteria for a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma were included in this study [1]. Cases diagnosed as B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (gray zone lymphoma) and cases found to have rearrangement of the MYC gene associated with rearrangement of the BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene (“double hit” lymphoma) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or conventional cytogenetics were excluded. All patients were staged according to the Ann Arbor system using a combination of physical examination, computed tomography and/or positron-emission tomography scan, and bone marrow evaluation. A subset of patients (n=5) underwent lumbar puncture for evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Patients meeting criteria for Ann Arbor stage I or II were classified as having localized disease. Patients meeting criteria for Ann Arbor stage III or IV were classified as having disseminated disease. Treatment was based on clinical and staging information via institutional protocols. Median follow-up, calculated from date of initial diagnosis to date of death from any cause or date of last follow-up, was 33 months (range, 12-361 months).   2.2 Morphologic examination Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained tissue sections were reviewed in combination with Diff-Quik and Papanicolaou-stained fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears. H&E-stained core biopsy and clot sections, as well as Wright-Giemsa–stained bone marrow aspirate smears and touch imprints, were also reviewed.   2.3 Immunophenotypic analysis Immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry was performed on tissue, bone marrow, and/or FNA specimens using a FACScan instrument (Becton-Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as described previously [14]. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections; the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method; and an automated immunostainer (Ventana-Biotech, Tucson, AZ). The antibodies used were specific for CD10 and BCL-2 (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and CD20, BCL6, and Ki-67 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA was performed using Epstein-Barr Early RNA Probe Reagents (Ventana-Biotech) in 2 patients.   2.4 Cytogenetic analysis Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed to detect MYC rearrangement on diagnostic tissue samples using a Vysis LSI MYC dual-color break-apart probe, which hybridizes to band 8q24 (spectrum orange on the centromeric side and spectrum green on the telomeric side of the MYC gene breakpoint) (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL).   2.5 Literature review A search of the English literature was conducted to identify reported cases of Burkitt lymphoma primarily involving the thyroid gland. Because of the heterogeneity of terminology in the literature, the review was limited to relatively recent reports of cases diagnosed as Burkitt lymphoma and did not include cases described as “atypical,” “Burkitt-like,” or “double hit” lymphomas in the thyroid gland.

369,S0046-8177(11)00147-X,"In immunocompromised patients, Epstein-Barr virus lymphadenitis can mimic angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma morphologically, immunophenotypically, and genetically: a case report and review of the literature"," 2 Case report Clinical presentation: A 16-year-old African American male initially diagnosed at 18 months of age with nephrotic syndrome secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis presented with diffuse lymphadenopathy, which had been progressing over the past year. He had enjoyed a 4-year period of clinical remission of his nephrotic syndrome on tacrolimus therapy. There was preauricular, cervical, and marked inguinal lymph nodal enlargement. Physical examination revealed left posterior cervical nodes measuring 1.5 to 2.5 cm and circumscribed, nonerythematous, mildly tender, mobile bilateral inguinal nodes measuring 4 to 5 cm in greatest diameter. Chest roentgenogram showed hilar adenopathy. Laboratory studies for bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, and fungal organisms were all negative with the exception of EBV with real-time polymerase chain reaction positive for 37,905,000 copies EBV DNA/mL (normal, <10 copies/mL). Lymph node morphology: Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained sections of the right inguinal lymph node were examined microscopically. At scanning magnification, outlines of residual lymph node were appreciable beyond which expansive sheets of relatively monotonous-appearing clear cells with admixed vessels effaced the perinodal soft tissue (Fig. 1A). At higher magnification, residual germinal centers appeared “moth-eaten” (Fig. 1B), some to the point of depletion. Extensive sclerosis/fibrosis was seen admixed with numerous arborizing epithelioid venules, lined by plump endothelial cells (Fig. 1C). Surrounding the blood vessels were numerous cells with small dark nuclei with abundant pink or clear cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). Areas with large cells with vesicular nuclei and large nucleoli consistent with immunoblasts were also present (Fig. 1D). Immunophenotypic studies: A battery of immunohistochemical and special stains was performed using standard methods. Staining for CD20 showed numerous poorly defined residual follicles (Fig. 2D) as well as a population of large atypical cells resembling Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin cells, which were also positive for CD30 but negative for CD15 (data not shown). The small, clear-cell population was positive for CD3 (Fig. 2B), CD4 (Fig. 3A), CD5 (data not shown), and CD43 (data not shown). These cells were negative for CD10 (data not shown) and weakly positive for PD-1 (Fig. 3C). Approximately 10% of the cells were positive for Ki-67 (Fig. 3D). Concentrations of CD8-positive cytotoxic lymphocytes were identified (Fig. 3B) in immediate proximity to clusters of CD20-positive B cells shown by in situ hybridization to be EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) positive (Fig. 2C). Molecular studies: Molecular probe studies based on polymerase chain reaction methods were negative for a clonal B-cell population with primers for the immunoglobulin heavy chain region but positive for the detection of a clonal T-cell population with primers for the T-gamma gene (Fig. 4 ). Clinical outcome: Tacrolimus was discontinued, leading to a marked reduction in plasma viral load to 333,000 copies EBV DNA/mL at 1 month and 1,838,250 copies EBV DNA/mL at 2 months. Positron emission tomographic scan evaluation 2 months after discontinuation of immunosuppression disclosed low activity in lymph nodal areas. Over the ensuing several months, the patient received first corticosteroids followed by rituximab (two 375 mg/mL doses separated by a 2-week interval), once again achieving remission of his renal disease without further need for immunosuppression. There was complete resolution of lymphadenopathy with undetectable EBV viral loads with serial monitoring up to the time of submission of this article, 2 years after his initial presentation. He had required no further immunosuppressive therapy for control of his renal disease until the twenty-second month after biopsy when there was recurrence of glomerular dysfunction. "
371,S2152-2650(11)00054-1,Hepatitis C Reactivation in Patients Who Have Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Treated With Rituximab: A Case Report and Review of Literature," Discussion  Prevalence of HCV Infection In Patients Who Have Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma A population-based study from Italy reported that prevalence of HCV among the general population was 1.24% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23%-1.25%). A total of 65,127 HCV-infected people were studied over 4 years; drug users (35.1%, 95% CI 34.6%-35.7%) and dialysis patients (21.1%, 95% CI 20.2%-22.0%) had the highest incidence of HCV infection. 3  Increased prevalence of HCV infection (9% to 37%) has been observed in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 4,5  An International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium study consisted of 4,784 cases of NHL and 6,269 controls matched by age, gender, and study center. HCV infection was detected in 172 NHL cases (3.60%) and in 169 (2.70%) controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.40–2.25). HCV infection was associated with marginal zone lymphoma (OR 2.47, 95% CI, 1.44–4.23), DLBCL (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.68–2.99), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.14–5.79). Risk estimates were not increased for follicular lymphoma (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65–1.60). 6  In a meta-analysis by Libra et al, 18 Italian studies on prevalence of NHL and HCV infection were reviewed with 2736 patients; reporting prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in 19.7% NHL patients (range, 8.3% to 37.1%). 7   In particular, extranodal lymphomas have been associated with HCV infection. 8  Prevalence of HCV infection has been reported among 68% of primary splenic lymphoma and 66% of primary hepatic lymphoma. 9  In a retrospective analysis, 24 of 25 patients (96%) had a B-cell lymphoma, subtyped as DLBCL (18 cases), small lymphocytic (3 cases), follicular lymphoma (2 cases) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (1 case). A Korean study compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 32 HCV-positive DLBCL patients with those of 371 patients with HCV-negative DLBCL who had been sequentially registered during the same period in a single center. 10  A higher percentage of HCV-positive DLBCL cases were associated with being 60-years-old or older. However, these results differed from the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA) studies LNH 93 and LNH 98, 11  in which HCV infection prevalence was 0.5% (26 of 5,586 patients). HCV-positive DLBCL cases were more frequently transformed from low-grade lymphoma than other cases of DLBCL (32% versus 6%, P = .02). Extranodal/splenic involvement (46% versus 17%, P = .001) was also more common in HCV-positive patients. Although significant associations between HCV and NHL have been reported in numerous studies, the differences in the magnitude of these associations could be attributed to differences in geographical prevalence of HCV infection, differences in viral load, and differences in HCV genotype or other factors. 12-14     Is HCV Involved In Lymphomagenesis? The pathogenesis involved in HCV-related NHL remains unclear. The HCV genome is not integrated into the host genome, suggesting the possibility of other mechanisms for the malignant transformation of lymphoid cells. One hypothesis that chronic antigenic stimulation from HCV infection results in chronic stimulation of B cells producing a polyclonal expansion of these cells, which with the further occurrence of additional genetic changes, may give rise to monoclonal expansion resulting in NHL. 15  Given that HCV-related NHL arises after a long-lasting infection, chronology supports this hypothesis. In B cells, chronic HCV exposure may induce a t(14;18) translocation, leading to over-expression of the anti-apoptotic factor bcl-2 with monoclonal immunoglobulin H rearrangement. 16  A Japanese study indicated that peripheral blood B cells of chronic HCV patients were infected with HCV. Expression levels of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, associated with occurrence of B-NHL, were dramatically increased in the B cells compared with those of healthy subjects, suggesting a possible relationship between chronic HCV infection and B-cell lymphomagenesis. 17  Other possible mechanisms of B-cell proliferation secondary to HCV infection are alterations in the transcriptional regulation of genes such as p21, p53, and H.ras by the viral core and/ or NS35 proteins. 18,19     Role of Antiviral Therapy In the Management of HCV-Associated Lymphomas An Italian study provided evidence about the potential role of antiviral therapy in the management of patients with HCV-related low-grade B-cell NHL. Thirteen patients with low-grade B-NHL and co-infection with HCV underwent antiviral treatment with pegylated-interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin attaining an overall response rate of 74%. At a median follow-up of 14 months, among the 12 assessable patients, the overall response rate was 75% (7 complete remission [CR] and 2 partial response [PR]). 20  Of the 9 responders, 7 achieved disappearance of detectable viremia in serum. Overall response significantly correlated to decrease/disappearance of HCV viremia (P = .005). All the nonresponders had no virologic response. Another recent Italian study confirmed the previous observations that patients with low-grade, indolent B-NHL with HCV positivity could attain remission of lymphoma as well as reductions in HCV viremia when treated with PEG IFN and ribavirin. Among the 17 patients, 8 were randomized to IFN alpha-2b (IFN ?-2b) along with ribavirin and 9 patients were randomized to PEG IFN ?-2b along with ribavirin. Three CRs (37%) were observed in the IFN ?-2b group and six CRs (60%) were observed in the PEG IFN ?-2b group. Interestingly, all the patients who had CR had sustained virologic responses at the end of treatment at 48 weeks. 21   Although little is known regarding the management of hepatitis C during lymphoma therapy, reactivation of chronic HBV during chemotherapy for DLBCL and HBV prophylactic strategies have been extensively reported. 22  In a Chinese trial, HBV- seropositive patients with NHL undergoing chemotherapy were randomized to receive prophylactic or therapeutic lamivudine. For the patients in prophylactic-versus-therapeutic arms, HBV reactivation was 11.5% versus 56% (P ? .001), HBV-related hepatitis was 7.7% versus 48% (P ? .001), and severe hepatitis with alanine transaminase more than 10-fold upper limits of normal was 0% versus 36% (P ? .001), respectively. However, the role of HBV reactivation with rituximab was not assessed, as all the patients in the trial were treated with CHOP alone. 23   In a retrospective review of 456 patients who were administered rituximab at Henry Ford Hospital, 32 patients with positive HBV serology received rituximab alone (14) or with chemotherapy (18) for NHL (17), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (8), or other causes (7). One-third of the patients with positive HBV serology developed acute liver events when treated with rituximab. HBV serology screening was advised before rituximab treatment, although no strict criteria or recommendations exist. 24  Ziakas et al conducted a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of prophylactic lamivudine on the risk of HBV reactivation and HBV mortality in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)–positive lymphoma patients undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 25  They found that lamivudine prophylaxis was associated with a significant reduction in HBV reactivation (risk ratio [RR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.13-0.35) and a trend in reducing HBV-related mortality (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.19- 2.49). Furthermore, using decision tree modeling, they studied the long-term effects of anti-HBV prophylaxis when prolonged immunosuppression is needed. Extended 2-year rituximab maintenance in B-cell lymphomas was used as a paradigm of prolonged immunosuppression. They found that extended anti-HBV prophylaxis could improve overall survival rates by 2.4% in HBsAg-positive patients. Another decision analysis model by Saab et al compared the costs and clinical outcomes of using lamivudine prophylaxis versus initiating lamivudine only when clinically overt hepatitis occurred among hepatitis B carriers undergoing chemotherapy. 26  They found that lamivudine prophylaxis was effective in reducing both liver- and lymphoma-related deaths with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $33,514 per life year, and therefore considered optimal compared with starting lamivudine on evidence of overt hepatitis. For those patients who test positive for HBV, lamivudine prophylaxis is recommended during treatment. However, similar recommendations for HCV infection remain undefined. Whereas reactivation of HBV after chemotherapy has been well-documented, chemotherapy-induced HCV reactivation in DLBCL is relatively rarely reported. There are case reports in which lymphoma has regressed after antiviral treatment. 21,27-30  Currently, data are insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the effect of HCV viral load, reactivation, and treatment on the prognosis of lymphoma patients.   Do the Outcomes for HCV-Associated Lymphomas Differ From Other Lymphomas? In the study performed by De Renzo et al described above, 9  92% of the patients with primary hepatic lymphoma or primary splenic lymphoma were alive at a median follow-up of 79 months (Table 1), suggesting that these two entities are characterized by good prognosis. No toxic effects were observed from conventional chemotherapy despite the presence of chronic liver disease in the setting of chronic HCV infection including three patients with cirrhosis, all of whom had a Child-Pugh stage A disease. The authors concluded that HCV infection should not constitute a limitation to conventional chemotherapy. A Japanese study monitored serum HCV RNA in patients with HCV-infected CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma undergoing rituximab combination chemotherapy. Among 81 patients (42-DLBCL; 22-FL; 14-MALT; 3-mantle cell lymphoma), 6 (7.4%) were positive for HCV antibody, and 5 of those 6 patients had detectable HCV RNA before chemotherapy. None had received treatment for HCV infection. Three of five patients with HCV infection received the R-CHOP regimen; one of five received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and epirubicin; and one of five patients received R-CHO (rituximab was administered at 375 mg/m2 once a week for 8 weeks x eight cycles). Four of five patients achieved CR and one of five had a PR. Serum HCV RNA levels in five patients treated with rituximab combination chemotherapy showed a significant increase during chemotherapy. 31   A case of rituximab-induced HCV reactivation in DLBCL was reported from China. 32  A 68-year-old man with DLBCL, stage IIIA, with an IPI score of 3 was positive for HCV antibody with normal liver function tests and absence of liver cirrhosis. After the first cycle of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine, and prednisone (CNOP) was administered, no abnormal lab functions were identified, and the second cycle of CNOP was administered with rituximab. The patient had transaminitis and HCV RNA increased to 5.6 × 106/mL. Upon withholding further therapy, the patient's transaminitis resolved along with radiologic evidence of DLBCL in remission. HCV-RNA levels 6 months later was less than 100/mL. In another Japanese multicenter retrospective study, 553 DLBCL patients (131 HCV- positive) receiving RCHOP-like chemotherapy were analyzed. 33  HCV-RNA levels were evaluated at three different intervals: at baseline, 1 month post-treatment, and at 6 months post-treatment. HCV-RNA levels in the HCV-positive patients increased significantly during immunochemotherapy (P = .006, mean HCV-RNA 1001, 3187, and 1986 KIU/mL, respectively, during the three intervals), however, the criteria for discontinuing immunotherapy were not clearly specified. 33  There was a significant increase in HCV-RNA levels during immunochemotherapy at 1 month post-treatment with a trend towards decreasing levels at 6 months post-treatment. This suggests that immunochemotherapy potentially induces HCV reactivation and viral load decreases toward baseline after completion of immunochemotherapy. 33,34  The study reported that pretreatment transaminases were predictive of severe hepatic toxicity. In another retrospective study, the incidence of liver function impairment in HCV-infected patients who underwent chemotherapy to treat DLBCL was higher. 35  In this study, most patients completed their therapeutic courses without interruption because liver injuries were usually mild, from grade 1 to grade 2. One case of DLBCL (treated with bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, prednisone, and vincristine) with HCV and another case of Hodgkin lymphoma (treated with bleomycin, dacarbazine, doxorubicin, and vinblastine) with HCV were reported to develop severe hepatitis after conventional chemotherapy indicating that massive liver cell necrosis can arise in chronic carriers of HCV on withdrawal of chemotherapy or reduction of glucocorticoids, suggesting an immune-mediated mechanism of hepatocyte damage. 36   In the Korean study, nodal presentation was the only independent factor favorably influencing the event-free survival (EFS) in HCV-positive DLBCL (hazard ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.95, P = .012). Surprisingly, HCV-positive DLBCL patients had a superior CR and EFS (P = .02). 10  According to the authors, the superior survival outcome for HCV-positive DLBL may be secondary to transformation from low-grade NHL. In the GELA study, 11  HCV-positive patients had worse overall survival (P = .02) but no differences in EFS (P = .13). After matching for age and prognosis factors, at 2 years of follow-up, the overall survival was 56% (95% CI 33%-76%) among HCV-positive patients, versus 80% (95% CI 70% to 89%), and the EFS was 53% (95% CI 33%-72%) versus 74% (95% CI 64%-84%). The short-term hepatic toxicity of chemotherapy was greater among HCV-positive patients.  "
376,S1092-9134(16)30065-X,"Primary cardiac diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in immunocompetent patients: clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic, and genotypic features of 3 cases"," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study group We reviewed the files of the Department of Pathology, for cases of cardiac and/or pericardial (pericardium) lymphoma, diagnosed between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2015. In our study, the inclusion criterion was that the lymphomatous disease had to be confined to the heart and/or pericardium. Cases that involved the heart secondarily from other anatomic sites were excluded. We collected clinical, radiologic, and pathologic information from the medical records or by communication from treating physicians. This study was approved as being of minimal and no risk by the Institutional Domain Specific Review Board (reference number 2014/00 042). Informed consent was also obtained from the patients for publication of their clinical histories.   2.2 Histologic and immunohistochemical methods Four-micrometer-thick histologic sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histologic evaluation. Imunohistochemical studies were performed in the Department of Pathology laboratory using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. During antigen retrieval, tissue sections were immersed in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, as appropriate for each antibody. After the sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, antibodies against CD3 (rabbit polyclonal; Dako, Carpinteria, California), CD20 (clone L26; Dako), PAX5 (clone SP34; Ventana, Tucson, Arizona), CD79A (clone JCB117; Dako), CD5 (clone 4C7; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), CD10 (clone 56C6; Leica), BCL6 (clone LN22; Leica), MUM1 (clone MUM1p; Dako), BCL2 (clone 124; Dako), C-MYC (clone Y69; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), Cyclin D1 (clone SP4; Thermo Fisher, Carlsbad, California), Ki-67 (clone MIB-1; Dako), and CD30 (clone Ber-H2; Dako) were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) studies. These studies were performed using an automated immunostainer (Benchmark XT from Ventana/Roche) and a streptavidin-biotin peroxidase detection system. The cutoff scores for documentation of positive staining for some antibodies (markers) were as follows: 30% for CD10, 30% for BCL6, 60% for MUM1, 40% for CMYC, and 70% for BCL2.   2.3 In situ hybridization For detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–encoded RNA (EBER), in situ hybridization was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the Ventana ready-to-use kit as prescribed by the manufacturer.   2.4 Molecular fluorescence in situ hybridization studies For detection of MYC gene rearrangements, the Vysis LSI MYC Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using the Vysis paraffin pretreatment kit II system (Vysis, Downer's Grove, Illinois). For detection of BCL2 gene rearrangements, the Vysis LSI BCL2 Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using the Vysis paraffin pretreatment kit II system (Vysis).   2.5 Molecular polymerase chain reaction studies Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific probe and primer sets targeted at the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen region, ORF26E gene of human herpesvirus (HHV)-8, and IE1 protein (U90) region of HHV-6 was carried out on DNA extracted from the pericardial fluid and quantitated against standard curves.

380,S0090-4295(18)31001-X,Case of Delayed Ileal Conduit Necrosis Related to Infiltrative Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma," CASE The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of sacral spina bifida and up shunted hydrocephalus who underwent cystectomy and IC at the age of 2. She is otherwise healthy, although is an active smoker, and her conduit had been functioning well for many years. She presented to the urology clinic with new onset protrusion around her IC stoma and intermittent lower back pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained, which revealed bilateral nonobstructing kidney stones, a long tortuous conduit and a thick-walled edematous stoma above the fascia (Fig. 1 ). She subsequently underwent treatment for her 8 mm left renal stone with Electrohydraulic Shockwave Lithtripsy (ESWL) and returned to the urology clinic to re-evaluate the bulge around her stoma. At that time the stoma was healthy, with a surrounding nontender bulge. While it was not a true parastomal hernia, there appeared to be redundant bowel between the fascia and skin. She was counseled that she would likely require revision, but chose to delay surgery. One month later, she returned with increasing pain, induration, purple discoloration, and ulceration of the stoma. Endoscopy of the conduit was performed which revealed distal ischemic changes (gray-white mucosa), stenosis at the level of the fascia, and proximal healthy pink conduit mucosa. She was scheduled for elective repair, but returned to clinic several days later with an obvious necrotic stoma and severe abdominal pain. On examination at that time, the entire stoma was necrotic with sloughing tissue and a urinary-cutaneous fistula where the conduit was separating from the skin. She was admitted to the hospital for pain control and a bowel prep before taking her to operating room the following day. She underwent exploratory laparotomy and take down of her old IC stoma (Fig. 2 A) via a midline incision. We found a necrotic, friable stoma, and ischemic bowel wall above the fascia with surrounding purulent drainage. A 22 French Robnel catheter could not be passed proximally into the conduit due to a tight stricture. Once fully delineated, the conduit was spatulated along the antimesenteric border proximally, and 2 tight mid-conduit strictured areas were identified. Thus, the decision was made to resect the old IC and create a new one. Of note, during this dissection, several enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the small bowel mesentery and were assumed to be reactive. The new IC was fashioned from 20 cm of ileum in standard Bricker fashion and the stoma was placed on the left side, away from the previous infected stoma site on the right (Fig. 2B). The old stoma site fascia was closed primarily and the skin packed open. Postoperatively course was uneventful until the fourth postoperative day. She developed significant tachycardia, tachypnea, and green-tinged drainage from her Jackson-Pratt drain but no peritoneal signs. CT scan at that time was inconclusive, and she was then transferred to the ICU for resuscitation. She then underwent celiotomy for presumed bowel leak. Two perforated areas of small bowel were found: one 10 cm proximal to the ileal-ileal stapled functional end-end anastomosis, and the other just distal to the ligament of Treitz in the proximal jejunum. The prior ileal-ileal anastomosis was resected along with the perforation and a new end-end stapled anastomosis created. Similarly, the jejunal perforation was resected and a stapled anastomosis was performed. The abdomen was washed out and was left open with a temporary abdominal closure Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) system in place (AB-Thera, KCI, San Antonio, TX) as part of a planned damage-control management. She was then resuscitated in the ICU and remained on vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She was taken back to the operating room twice more; once for a washout and a second time for abdominal closure with a biologic collagen matrix. The wound and previous stoma site were left open and a wound VAC was placed. She improved clinically thereafter, was transferred to the floor and slowly advanced in diet. She was severely deconditioned from prolonged ICU stay and required extensive physical and occupational therapy. Pathology from the initial operation and the second bowel resection returned transmural diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the IC specimen as well as the 2 perforated bowel segments. Histologic sections contained multifocal, diffuse proliferation of lymphoid cells with transmural intestinal involvement associated with mucosal ulceration and serosal changes. Immunohistochemistry was positive for proto-oncogene (MYC) (30% subset weak), CD20, BCL2 (small subset weak), BCL6, MUM1, and Ki67 (proliferative index 80%) and was negative for CD3, CD10, CD21, and CD163 (Fig. 3 ). Restaging CT scan at 2 weeks postoperative noted enlarging retroperitoneal adenopathy and several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. Seventeen days after her last surgery, she was started fractionated RCE (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and rituximab). She tolerated her first cycle of chemotherapy well, and 3 months later was able to receive a second cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone. Unfortunately, her course over the next months was complicated by multiple issues including neutropenic sepsis, enterocutaneous fistula requiring prolonged Non Per Os (NPO) status and total parenteral nutrition, persistent abdominal abscesses requiring drain placement, and intravenous antibiotics, and poor wound healing requiring skin grafting. To date, the patient is alive, receiving palliative care with no further plans for additional chemotherapy. "
382,S0046-8177(16)30044-2,Two cases of histiocytic sarcoma with BCL2 translocations and occult or subsequent follicular lymphoma," 2 Case report  2.1 Case 1 We received a liver biopsy for consultation from a 77-year-old female with multiple liver lesions. A complete blood count revealed an isolated normocytic anemia (white cells: 4.6 K/?L, red blood cells: 3.17 × 106/?L, hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL, hematocrit: 26.3%, mean corpuscular volume: 82.9 fL, platelets: 172 K/?L). The biopsy contained a proliferation of cells with abundant, pale, eosinophilic, vacuolated cytoplasm and elongated nuclei with vesicular chromatin and irregular nuclear contours (Fig. 1A). Only scant, histologically unremarkable background liver was present. Immunohistochemical stains were performed and showed that the abnormal proliferation consisted of cells that expressed CD45, CD43, dim to moderate CD4, partial dim CD56, and lysozyme (Fig. 1B-E). Additional stains showed that the tumor was negative for CD68 and CD163, which are markers that are often used to suggest histiocytic differentiation. CD34, CD117, TdT, markers of immature hematolymphoid cells, were also negative. Additional immunostains for MPO, CD30, CD79a, CD20, CD3, CD1a, CD5, CD7, TCL1, CD8, CD123, CK7, CK20, and S100 were all negative. Based on the histologic and immunophenotypic features, the main differential diagnosis under consideration included myeloid sarcoma and histiocytic sarcoma. Concern for hematolymphoid malignancy prompted a bone marrow biopsy for staging purposes. As seen in Fig. 1F and G, the bone marrow core biopsy showed aggregates of neoplastic cells with features similar to those seen in the liver biopsy. While much of the cellularity of the bone marrow core biopsy consisted of the malignant histiocytic infiltrate, relatively preserved hematopoiesis was present focally. In contrast, the hemodilute bone marrow aspirate showed sparse, histologically unremarkable hematopoietic elements, without sampling of the pleomorphic histiocytic population. Flow cytometry performed on the bone marrow aspirate showed a CD10-, CD19-, and CD20-positive, k-monotypic B-cell population with a k light chain ratio of approximately 35:1. CD34+ progenitors were not increased, accounting for approximately 1.2% of total CD45+ events, and there was no abnormal blast or monocytic population. The unexpected finding of a light chain–restricted B-cell population by flow cytometry prompted us to re-examine the bone marrow biopsy. As shown in Fig. 1F, there were few small, loose aggregates of small lymphocytes associated with the larger malignant cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the small lymphocytes expressed the B cell markers CD20, PAX5, Oct2, and BOB1 and the germinal center markers CD10, BCL6, HGAL and LMO2, supporting the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. Interestingly, the large malignant cells expressed BCL6 and showed dim expression of HGAL, but were negative for B-lineage–specific markers Oct2, PAX5, and CD20. The abnormal pleomorphic cells were also negative for CD10 and LMO2. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on the hemodilute bone marrow aspirate material with the BCL2 separation probe (ZytoVision, D-27572 Bremerhaven, Germany), which identifies translocation-mediated rearrangement of the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18. Analysis of 200 nuclei demonstrated a variable 5?/3? BCL2 signal separation pattern in 18 (9%) nuclei, further supporting the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. We performed interphase FISH with a BCL2 separation probe on the liver biopsy, which showed no histologic or immunohistochemical evidence of follicular lymphoma. Analysis of 200 nuclei was positive for separation of 5? and 3? BCL2 signals in 176 (88%) of the nuclei. Previous studies have identified BCL2 gene translocations in histiocytic sarcoma [2–6], and this gene is not recurrently translocated in acute myeloid leukemias [7]. Based on the histologic, immunophenotypic, flow cytometric, and cytogenetic profile, the diagnosis for the liver biopsy was rendered as histiocytic sarcoma with a BCL2 gene translocation, and the subsequent bone marrow biopsy as histiocytic sarcoma associated with a minor component of low grade follicular lymphoma.   2.2 Case 2 We searched the pathology records at our institution for histiocytic sarcoma preceding a lymphoma diagnosis and found one additional case of histiocytic sarcoma that occurred in a patient who was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma 4 years following treatment for histiocytic sarcoma. We performed FISH and confirmed the presence of a BCL2 translocation in the original histiocytic sarcoma. This case was previously reported as part of a set of 23 cases of histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcomas, and was the only one in that series to harbor an IGH/BCL2 gene translocation [8]. At the time of the previous report, the patient had not yet received a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. Here we report the clinical follow-up of this case. The patient was a 57-year-old man who presented with an enlarging mass in the right flank muscles. A CT scan showed evidence of pulmonary metastases. A biopsy of the right flank mass was performed, and histologic sections showed sheets of discohesive malignant cells characterized by abundant, eosinophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei with occasional prominent single nucleoli (Fig. 2A and B). Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor expressed CD45RB, lysozyme, and CD163, with a subset of the cells expressing S100p (Fig. 2C and D). Interestingly, this case, as previously reported, was positive for the B-cell transcription factor Oct2, however it was negative for the B-cell marker CD20. As reported by Chen et al, the histiocytic sarcoma had a IGH/BCL2 fusion gene detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and targeted dual FISH analysis [8]. After the diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma, the patient was treated with 5 cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and prednisone and radiation therapy and achieved a complete response. Four years after the diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a soft tissue mass near the posterior iliac crest revealed an atypical CD10-positive B-cell proliferation concerning for a low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and four subsequent FNAs showed similar findings. Three years later a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, grade 1–2 of 3, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (comprising 60% of the lymphoma cells) was made on excisional biopsies of a right inguinal lymph node and a right pelvis/flank lesion. The patient was treated with 6 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, procarbazine, and prednisone and at the time of preparation of this manuscript, was on maintenance rituximab, with radiographic evidence of progressive disease. At the time of preparation of this manuscript (over 8 years of follow-up), the patient had had no biopsy-proven residual or recurrent histiocytic sarcoma.  "
383,S0915-6992(11)00065-3,Primary sublingual gland marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type: A case report," 2 Case report A 64-year-old man complaining of a painless swelling on the left side of the floor of the mouth was referred to our department. His medical history included chronic nephritis, osteoporosis, and retinal pigmentary degeneration. The patient's medications included revitalization type vitamin D3 medicine and sodium risedronate hydrate. His family history was unremarkable. Clinical examination showed a diffuse, firm, and painless swelling on the left side of the floor of the mouth (Fig. 1a). Routine blood tests, hematochemistry, and urine tests showed no abnormal findings. Computed tomography showed a low density area of about 24mm×22mm×11mm in size ranging from the floor of the mouth to the mylohyoid muscle (Fig. 1b). T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-delineated hypointense lesion on the left side of the floor of the mouth (Fig. 1c). Positron emission tomography combined with CT imaging using 18-flouro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) showed an isolated focus of severe uptake of FDG on the left side of the floor of the mouth corresponding to the sublingual gland (Fig. 1d). The standard uptake value for this lesion was 4.4. No other isolated foci were found in any other regions. We diagnosed the mass as a malignant tumor originating from the sublingual gland. The tumor was extirpated from the floor of the mouth with the sublingual grand. Histological examination revealed a diffuse proliferation of round, small to medium plasmacytoid cells and lymphoid cells under the mucosa (Fig. 2a). Dense atypical lymphoid cell infiltration with severe destruction of adjacent normal salivary glands was also revealed. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD20 (Fig. 2b) and CD79a (Fig. 2c). Ki-67 positive cells were primarily localized to scattered transformed large cells (Fig. 2d). On the basis of clinical and histological results, the tumor was diagnosed as a primary sublingual gland marginal zone B cell lymphoma of MALT type. Careful clinical follow up for 36 months after extirpation showed no recurrence, and the patient remained asymptomatic. "
384,S1687-1979(11)00011-6,Mantle cell lymphoma of the colon with massive splenomegaly: A case report," Case report A 77-year-old female initially presented to a local hospital in November 2005 with a history of left hypochondriac dragging sensation of 4months’ duration associated with low-grade fever. Examination at that time revealed moderate splenomegaly. Bone-marrow biopsy revealed poorly demarcated aggregates of atypical lymphocytes varying in size, and immunohistochemical studies showed positive CD20 and BCL-2. She received six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy. She however relapsed after a few months and again developed progressive splenomegaly. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed huge splenomegaly, measuring at least 30cm craniocaudal showing multiple wedge-shaped low-attenuation areas suggestive of a differential of multiple splenic infarcts versus lymphomatous infiltration. The huge spleen had displaced the small- and large-bowel loops to the contralateral side. It had also displaced the left kidney posteriorly. The liver and other viscera were normal. She underwent an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) and a colonoscopic examination, which revealed some nodularity at the pylorus (Fig. 1 ), and colonoscopy showed oedematous mucosa at the transverse colon, the descending colon and the caecum. No other abnormality was seen (Figs. 2 and 3  ). Biopsy revealed MCL. The patient underwent splenectomy in January 2008 because of the features of hypersplenism and fear of bleeding even with minor trauma. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections showed extensive involvement of white pulp and red pulp by monomorphic small atypical lymphocytes with an area of infarction. In addition, the sections also revealed lymph node involved by the same neoplastic process. Flow cytometry performed on the spleen demonstrated lymphoma cells positive for CD45, CD19,CD20, CD5, human leucocyte antigen- DR-1 (HLA-DR) and lambda restricted and negative for CD23. The patient received rituximab 375mgm?2 for four cycles. Bortezomib 1.3mgm?2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 and rituximab were used as maintenance. After a few months, she relapsed at the right side of the neck and presented with a right neck mass 4×5cm and a right tonsillar mass. She was given external beam radiotherapy; she received 50Gy in 25 fractions. She tolerated the treatment well without any unacceptable side effects. In December 2009, she presented with recurrent rectal bleeding of 2months’ duration. On examination, she was haemodynamically stable with mild hepatomegaly. On evaluation, she had a haemoglobin level of 11gmdl?1 and normal liver and renal function tests. Colonoscopy revealed multiple mass lesions at various sites in the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon and caecum as shown in Figs. 4–7    . There were no synchronous lesions seen on upper GI endoscopy. The colonic biopsy (Figs. 8–10   ) was suggestive of non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma consistent with MCL. "
389,S1571-4675(11)00037-X,Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma presented as panniculitis of breast in a male patient: A case report," 2 Case report A 33-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a history of growing palpable mass in left breast and axilla, which spread to right breast after one month. On physical examination, multiple tender reddish masses were palpable in both breast and left axilla. There were erythematous changes on the skin of each breast. Fine needle aspiration cytology at outside hospital showed that adipose tissue with several lymphocytes, suspected fat necrosis. Ultrasonogram (US) showed extensive hyperechoic lesions from dermis to entire subcutaneous fat layer with intervening low echoic lines in both breasts (Fig. 1A and B). The intervening low echoic lines looked like lymphatic dilatations, frequently seen in inflammatory breast cancer or breast edema. Due to extensive hyperechogenicity of fat layer, our impression was inflammatory disease including panniculitis or fat necrosis. Skin punch biopsy for left breast revealed nodular dense infiltration of atypical large lymphocytes in deep dermis and perivascular infiltration of large pleomorphic lymphocytes (Fig. 1C and D). Result of immunochemistry was positive for EBV in situ hybridization (ISH), CD3, CD56, CD30 and negative for CD20 (Fig. 1E). The final pathologic diagnosis was ENK/T-nasal type lymphoma. PET-CT showed multiple hypermetabolic malignant tissues in both glottic and supraglottic areas, both anterior chest walls, upper back areas and upper arms, lungs, and perirenal and cervical lymph nodes, suggesting lymphomatous involvement (Fig. 1F). Chest CT showed diffuse subcutaneous infiltration involving both breasts and upper back and multiple ill-defined nodular consolidations along bronchovascular bundles in both lungs, suggesting lymphoma involvement. After chemotherapy according to the SMILE scheme (dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, l-asparaginase and etoposide), the subcutaneous lesions markedly regressed in two months. "
390,S0363-5023(17)31873-7,A Rare Manifestation of Primary Bone Lymphoma: Solitary Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma of the Little Finger," Case Report A 77-year-old man noticed painless crepitation and instability in the right little finger and visited his family doctor with these complaints. X-ray examination revealed osteolysis and a pathological fracture of the proximal phalanx (Fig. 1 ). The patient was admitted to our department for further diagnostic evaluation. The clinical examination showed mild swelling of the little finger as well as distinct ulnar instability of the fifth metacarpophalangeal joint. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy and no palpable lymph nodes and auscultation of the lungs did not reveal pathological respiratory sounds. There was no personal or family history of lymphoma or autoimmune diseases and the only medical problem reported by the patient was arterial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hand revealed an infiltrating intraosseous mass with cortical destruction at the site of the fracture (Fig. 2 ). A bone biopsy was performed that demonstrated a nonepithelial tumor displaying high reactivity to CD-20, high proliferation rate, and expression of CD-10 and MUM1, consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization for BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were negative (Fig. 3 ). Staging, which included computed tomography (CT) abdomen, CT thorax, positron emission tomography-CT and bone marrow puncture, did not show systemic dissemination or nodal involvement. The laboratory values, including complete blood count, B2-microglobilin and lactate dehydrogenase, were within normal limits. Considering the instability of the little finger (Fig. 4 A), which was negatively affecting the function of the entire hand, a digital amputation was recommended and performed (Fig. 4B). The histological examination of the amputated finger confirmed the diagnosis based on the bone biopsy and showed complete excision of the tumor. The tumor board recommended no further therapy, and regular follow-up examinations were suggested. "
393,S0736-4679(18)30627-9,Recurrent Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Presenting with Pancoast Syndrome: A Rare Cause of Radicular Neck Pain in the Emergency Department," Discussion DLBCL is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma comprising about one-third of reported cases. Patients typically present with constitutional symptoms in addition to complaints related to the anatomic location of the tumor. In the case of our patient, this was Pancoast syndrome, a constellation of signs and symptoms relating to the extrinsic compression of the anatomical structures in the thoracic inlet at the pulmonary apex (1,2). If the syndrome is associated with a malignant mass, it is referred to as a Pancoast tumor. This was first described by Pancoast in 1924 in the setting of lung cancer (1,2). The majority of cases are caused by non–small cell carcinomas and far outweigh other presentations (2). Only a handful of case reports have detailed DLBCL as the etiology (3–9). Space occupation of the thoracic inlet initially results in shoulder or medial scapular pain, which is commonly misdiagnosed as cervical osteoarthritis or radiculopathy. As extrinsic compression of the brachial plexus roots progresses, patients exhibit progressive numbness, weakness, and paresthesias, most commonly in a C7–T2 dermatomal distribution. Physical examination is often notable for weakness in the intrinsic hand muscles, as demonstrated in our patient's presentation, and if severe and longstanding, atrophy of the interossei as well. Compression of the ascending paravertebral sympathetic chain presents as Horner's syndrome, its own constellation of physical signs, including ipsilateral ptosis and miosis, and more variably anhydrosis (1,2). The location of the tumor makes it difficult to visualize on plain radiography as osteolytic degeneration of the surrounding inferior cervical and superior thoracic vertebrae usually only occurs late in the course. Diagnosis often necessitates computed tomography and appropriate treatment requires accurate identification of the cause (1,2). "
395,S0899-9007(11)00241-3,Late onset malnutrition from esophageal and phrenic dysfunction after radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma: A case report," Case report A 39-year-old man was admitted for severe weight loss. His medical history was relevant for Hodgkin's lymphoma: at 20 y of age he was treated with chemotherapy and received 40 Gy of supraclavicular, cervical, and mediastinal radiotherapy. He was considered in sustained remission. In April 2008, the patient progressively complained of swallowing difficulties because of esophageal dysphagia. The dysphagia worsened progressively from intermittent complaints about solid food to continuous impairment, including drinking liquids. This led to a 20-kg weight loss (31% of initial weight) over 1 y. In April 2009, his weight was 44.9 kg (body mass index 14.4 kg/m2), confirming severe malnutrition. His resting heart rate was consistently higher than 90 beats/min. The examination showed muscle wasting and dyspnea at rest with the use of accessory respiratory muscles. Lung auscultation showed a bilateral decrease of vesicular sounds, suggesting hypoventilation. The physical examination was otherwise normal, without any palpable adenopathy and no sign of peripheral neuropathy. Biological tests showed an albumin level of 34 g/L (normal >40 g/L), a transthyretin level of 0.15 g/L (normal >0.2 g/L), and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 260 IU/L (normal <400 IU/L). The complete blood cell count was normal. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Body composition with dual x-ray absorptiometry (Hologic Discovery QDR Series 12.5 for Windows XP, Bedford, MA, USA) showed a body fat mass of 5.3 kg and a fat-free mass of 37.3 kg. Bone densitometry showed osteoporosis (T score ?2.6). A computed tomogram showed bilateral fibrosis of the lung apex, no perigastric or periesophageal infiltration, and no pancreatic tumor. Esophageal and gastric endoscopic examinations were normal. Esophageal manometry showed no contraction in the upper part of the esophagus and a toneless lower esophageal sphincter. The barium swallow showed an open cardia, a straight lower esophagus without luminal abnormality, and no peristaltic contraction. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Autonomic dysfunction was suggested by the presence of orthostatic hypotension and by the absence of variation between inspiratory and expiratory heart rates in response to deep breathing. Arterial blood gases had a pH of 7.4, an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 55 mmHg, and an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 75 mmHg. A spirometric examination showed a severe restrictive syndrome with a vital capacity of only 22% of expected values and decreases in maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures, which were 23% and 19% of expected values, respectively. A nocturnal respiratory polygram was normal. A diaphragmatic electroneuromyogram showed axonal neuropathy of the phrenic nerves. Nutritional support was initiated progressively (10 kcal · kg?1 · d?1 for 3 d and then slowly increased to 40 kcal · kg?1 · d?1 over 7 d) with a phosphate supplement to avoid the refeeding syndrome, with a nasogastric tube followed by percutaneous gastrostomy. Respiratory failure caused by diaphragmatic paralysis was treated with nocturnal positive nasal airway pressure. Although the patient's weight increased to more than 50 kg, his recovery was further impaired by an aspiration pneumonia that eventually required tracheotomy. Total parenteral nutrition with dual-chamber bags with vitamins and trace elements administered through an implanted subcutaneous infusion port at night time was then indicated. "
400,S1507-1367(15)00115-7,Toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with radiotherapy and phenytoin in a patient with non-Hodking's lymphoma: A case report," 2 Case Twenty-eight-year old woman was diagnosed with primary mediastinal diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by biopsy of mediastinal bulky mass in April 2012. Six courses of standard doses R-CHOP regimen (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristin, prednisone) were administered and completed in September 2012 with complete remission (CR). After 2 months from the last dose of chemotherapy, she was presented to emergency service with symptoms and signs of epilepsy. Levetiracetam treatment was started to control seizures. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple lesions in around the left and right lateral ventricles and temporal horn. Stereotaxic biopsy was performed from a mass in the left anterior frontal lob and DLBCL was identified. She was treated with standard dose of IDARAM (idarubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate) regimen. But, after first cycle of chemotherapy, tonic–clonic epileptic seizures were detected and phenytoin was added to levetiracetam to control the seizures. Although the seizures were controlled with phenytoin, bullous skin lesions first appeared at the scalp at the 3rd day of whole cranial radiotherapy and 12th day of phenytoin therapy and generalized to whole body (Figs. 1 and 2  ). She had edematous lips with necrotic mucous membranes and oral ulcerations. Dermatological examination revealed the diagnosis of TEN and skin shave biopsy from the right femoral was performed. Lymphocytic infiltration of the dermo-epidermal junction, cell necrosis in epidermis and bullous formation in subepidermis was identified from the biopsy. All medications were stopped and wet-patches were applied to the whole skin surface and local skin care with antibiotic and antifungal dressings. Due to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance, parenteral nutrition was given and electrolyte balance was obtained by appropriate treatment. She was managed with systemic antibiotics and methylprednisolone (the dose of 1mg/kg). After supportive care her condition worsened, she manifested septicemia and hemodynamic instability and died after 3 weeks on phenytoin. "
401,S0046-8177(18)30071-6,Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8–associated extracavitary primary effusion lymphoma presenting as multiple lymphomatous polyposis," 2 Case presentation A 49-year-old African American man was admitted for ongoing vague abdominal pain and 20-lb weight loss within a month. He was found to have severe anemia and required frequent blood transfusion. Review of outside medical record revealed a positive HIV status, which was initially detected in 2015 with very low viral load, and no treatment was given since then. No known history of HIV-related opportunistic infection or neoplastic lesions was identified currently. The family history was unremarkable. Laboratory studies at admission showed severe anemia (hemoglobin 5.4 g/dL), normal white blood cell count (5.7 × 109/L) but with marked lymphopenia with CD4 count of 54, and borderline level of platelets (144 × 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated to 464. An abdominal/pelvic computed tomographic scan was performed which showed focal colonic wall thickening at the splenic flexure, consistent with severe colitis clinically. No significant systemic lymphadenopathy or body cavity effusion was noted by physical examination. No hepatosplenomegaly was identified. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were subsequently performed which showed 5 duodenal polyps and innumerable (>100) colonic polyps (too many to count). No discrete nodules or frank masses were identified. Multiple polyp biopsies from the duodenum to the rectum were submitted for pathologic evaluation. Fresh biopsy materials were also sent for adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutational testing, and the genetic counseling was scheduled for polyposis syndrome evaluation. Additional imaging studies demonstrated mild dural enhancement and very mild cervical/axillary lymphadenopathy. No significant body cavity effusion was detected and no evidence of Kaposi sarcoma was identified. Subsequent body fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells. No evidence of lymphomatous involvement was identified in 3 [3] consecutive bone marrow biopsies at presentation and at fellow-up 6 and 10 months later, respectively. The patient was treated with 6 cycles of dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubincin regimen, which was well tolerated. Repeated GI biopsies performed 2, 6, and 10 months after the initial diagnosis showed persistent disease even with tumor extension to the stomach presenting as distinctive gastric polyps. Despite persistent disease in his GI tract, the overall clinical course of the patient was relatively stable, well maintained with lenalidomide (REVLIMID) and other supportive measures one year after his initial diagnosis.

408,S2213-0071(17)30266-6,"Endobronchial ultrasound convex probe for lymphoma, sarcoidosis, lung cancer and other thoracic entities. A case series"," 2 Material and methods EBUS guided tissue material undergone by three-steps procedure. First step is the infiltration of visible tissues that can be selected by a niddle surgical forchep. This material is treated like histological specimen and followed by graduated over-night dehydration and then embedded in paraffin. Three micron tissue sections were taken for histological examination after Haematoxylin/Eosin (H/E) stained. The second step is the centrifugation of the rest material that provides a viscous deposit, full of small tissue fragments, that can be selected by a pipette and create a cell block. This material is also treated like a tissue one, followed by overnight dehydration and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections can be taken for histological examination. The third step is, the treatment of the rest complete liquid material, as a cytological material. This is centrifugated in a cytostatic centrifuge and the precipitate is coated on positive charged slides and stained by “Papanikolaou” (PAP) stain. More unstained slides can by prepared for cytochemical evaluation. The material that result by the two first steps, is a histological material, that can provide numerous sections for histological and immunohistochemical procedures. It is also suitable for molecular tests due to the adequate amount of DNA that can be extracted of the paraffin embedded tissues. All the biopsies were performed with a 22G Mediglobe needle (Fig. 1 ). In our case series we used a Pentax Convex-Probe-Endobronchial Ultrasound (Fig. 2 ). "
410,S2152-2650(11)00609-4,Complete Response to EPOCH in a Patient With HIV and Extracavitary Primary Effusion Lymphoma Involving the Colon: A Case Report and Review of Literature," Introduction Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare malignancy that accounts for < 5% of HIV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It usually presents as a lymphomatous growth in liquid phase within various body cavities such as the pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal spaces. 1  Although extracavitary tumors can occur in PEL, they do so rarely but may be histologically indistinguishable from PEL. 2-5  PEL is also defined by the expression of Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (also known as human herpesvirus 8 [HHV8]) in the tumor cells, except in the rare context of other immunosuppressed states. More than 70% of cases occur with concurrent Epstein-Barr virus infection. 6,7  Although the optimal treatment for PEL has not yet been defined, patients in most cases are treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin [hydroxydaunorubicin], vincristine [Oncovin], and prednisone) chemotherapy together with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Despite this, durable responses are rarely seen and survival is short, with median survivals around 4-6 months. 8  Herein, we present a case of extracavitary PEL in a newly diagnosed HIV-positive (HIV+) patient.

414,S1558-7673(11)00106-6,Primary Lymphoma of the Kidney: Case Report and Review of Literature," Introduction Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has progressively increased to 150% compared with the past century. 1  The evolution of this disease shows a variation of incidences and a significant increase in patients older than the normal bimodal pattern in which the age group most affected is the young adult, predominantly male, population. The incidence of cases of renal involvement in NHL has been reported as between 2.7% and 6%. 2  Compared with a secondary involvement, primary renal lymphoma is exceptional and represents about 1% of the all renal tumors. 3   The existence of a primary lymphatic renal disease (PRL) has been discussed, because the kidney does not contain lymphatic tissue and it is unclear how the disease may develop. Our hypothesis is the following: the presence of lymphatic tissue lymphatic vessels of the hilum or capsule or intensive recall of the B lymphocytes in the parenchyma in response to a persistent inflammation. There are approximately 100 cases described in the medical literature. 4  The term PRL is then applied to a renal localization in the absence of clinical manifestations of lymphatic disease in other organs and may also be defined as a NHL that starts. We present the case came to our observation and review of the literature. "
417,S1878-8750(18)31060-X,Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Presenting as Growing Intracerebral Hemorrhage," Case Report  History and Examination An 80-year-old, right-handed man presented with a 7-day history of mild dysarthria and was admitted to a local hospital. He had previously received treatment for hypertension. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a round, high-density mass surrounded by vasogenic edema in the left frontal lobe (Figure 1A ). Although the patient was placed on antihypertensive therapy for suspected subacute subcortical hemorrhage, neurologic symptoms gradually worsened. CT after 2 weeks revealed that the high-density lesion and surrounding edema had enlarged compared with the previous images (Figure 1B). From the radiologic findings, the presence of a brain tumor was suspected and the patient was referred to our department for further examination 14 days after the original admission to the local hospital. On admission, neurologic examination revealed motor aphasia and left hemiparesis. No history of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency was elicited. Routine blood testing including serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, sialyl Le(x) antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, and neuron specific enolase, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis yielded normal results. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis yielded negative results. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a mass lesion comprising hemorrhages of different phases in the left frontal lobe, with significant surrounding vasogenic edema. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) demonstrated a mass lesion with heterogeneous enhancement in the left frontal lobe; a small, round, enhancing lesion at the right centrum semiovale; and a lesion with cortical laminar enhancement in the left parietal lobe. A hemorrhagic lesion, as inferred from MRI, was located in the subcortical region of the left inferior portion of the precentral gyrus and the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Figure 2 ).   Operation The patient underwent craniotomy under general anesthesia. Under examination through a surgical microscope, the inferior precentral sulcus divided the inferior frontal gyrus from the precentral gyrus, which was dissected. The bottom of the sulcus was incised using a navigation system to avoid cortical injury. Gross total removal of the hemorrhagic lesion accompanied by rich blood vessels was performed without cortical injury. No new neurologic deficits were observed postoperatively.   Histopathologic Examination Histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen demonstrated CD20-positive diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Figure 3A ). Tumor cell cytoplasm and membrane stained positively for anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody (C-1, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in nearly all neoplastic cells (Figure 3B).   Postoperative Course Chemotherapy with high-dose intravenous methotrexate and leucovorin rescue achieved gradual improvement of neurologic symptoms. The tumor resolved on MRI and had not recurred as of 7 months postoperatively.  "
418,S2152-2650(11)00019-X,Regression of Hodgkin Lymphoma After Discontinuation of a Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitor for Crohn's Disease: A Case Report and Review of the Literature," Discussion A 54-year-old woman with a history of CD was diagnosed with nodular sclerosing HL incidentally after cervical lympadenopathy was identified during parathyroidectomy for surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism. An excisional lymph node biopsy confirmed Reed-Sternberg cells, which were positive for CD30 and CD15 and negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, and cyclin D1. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr–encoded RNA (EBER) produced positive results. Staging evaluation by computed tomography (CT) imaging at diagnosis confirmed stage IIIA disease. She received 3 cycles of the Stanford V regimen 6  and achieved a complete remission with this therapy. Her diagnosis of CD was made 16 years before her presentation with HL. She had undergone multiple previous bowel resections and was receiving chronic steroid therapy and azathioprine at the time of her HL diagnosis. She was started on adalimumab approximately 1 year after completing chemotherapy for her HL. Ten months after adalimumab was initiated, she was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. CT imaging performed for evaluation of these symptoms showed intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy as well as multiple hypodense lesions in the liver and spleen (Figure 1A,B). A liver biopsy was performed and confirmed evidence of recurrent nodular sclerosing HL (Figure 2 ). Morphologic and immunophenotypic features of the liver biopsy were similar to the findings from the initial diagnostic lymph node biopsy, with the exception of negative results on EBER immunostaining. She was offered salvage chemotherapy, but she opted against additional chemotherapy and a referral was made for home hospice services. At that time she was discharged on prednisone alone for control of her gastrointestinal symptoms. She saw her primary care physician 3 months after hospital discharge and described gradual overall improvement. CT imaging was repeated at that time, and revealed resolution of the previously seen liver and spleen lesions and the multiple regions of abdominal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C,D). She was rehospitalized 2 months later with recurrent abdominal pain and fever, which were attributed to cholecystitis based on inflammatory gallbladder changes on ultrasonographic imaging. She underwent open cholecystectomy and liver biopsy. Intraoperatively she was noted to have a probable abscess near the hilum of the liver, and a percutaneous drain was placed. An intraoperative liver biopsy showed evidence of residual HL; however, none of the imaging studies obtained at that time showed evidence of gross residual disease. Her postoperative course was complicated by a retroperitoneal hematoma, and her condition deteriorated over the subsequent days. She ultimately died 20 days postoperatively. "

423,S2212-5558(16)30009-6,A case of amyloid deposition in salivary glands with malignant lymphoma," 2 Case report The patient was a 69-year-old woman. She initially consulted our department in February 2011 with a chief complaint of swelling of bilateral submandibular glands (Fig. 1 ) and dry mouth. Swelling of bilateral submandibular glands had been observed since about 2007, and follow-up was being carried out by a family doctor. Since no change was subsequently observed in the swelling, and oral dryness started to develop, she was referred to our department by the Department of Internal Medicine at our hospital, where she had been undergoing treatment. The patient had a history of malignant lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma) in the left lung, for which she had undergone two courses of CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), in addition to radiotherapy, at 48 years of age. Malignant lymphoma was discovered by the presence of hilar lymphadenopathy, left upper lobe resection was performed for diagnosis, and the diagnosis was confirmed. Information about the details of treatment and the excised specimen at the time of initial presentation did not remain in the hospital and could not be verified. She developed a pleural effusion, malignant lymphoma recurrence was confirmed, and eight courses of CHOP therapy were administered at 58 years of age. The patient was then clinically diagnosed with complete response. She was then followed in our department. In September 2010, a tumor mass shadow was seen in the right lung, and a tissue biopsy was performed. In addition, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and herpes zoster were observed in the sacral region at the time of treatment. There was no family history of note. The patient had a moderate physique with good nutritional status, with no emergence of malignant lymphoma B symptoms. A localized, movable hard elastic mass was observed in bilateral submandibular and parotid glands. Oral dryness and atrophy of the lingual papilla were observed, but a sublingual caruncle and outflow of saliva from the openings of bilateral parotid glands were not seen. Low-signal regions were present in bilateral submandibular and parotid glands on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 2A, B), no abnormalities in renal or liver function were apparent from blood testing, and there were no increases in antibody levels (Table 1 ). Dry mouth was prominently observed using a gum test, which yielded 3.0ml of saliva in 10min. The differential diagnoses included Sjögren syndrome, Mikulicz disease, and submandibular gland neoplasm. The patient was undergoing follow-up for malignant lymphoma in the Department of Internal Medicine at our hospital, and a biopsy was planned in the Department of Thoracic Surgery of our hospital for the purpose of closely investigating a mass shadow in the right lung on follow-up computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 3 ). Biopsy of the submandibular gland was performed in our department. The extracted submandibular gland showed elastic, hard induration (Fig. 4 ). Amyloid deposition with accompanying lymphocytic infiltration was present on histopathological examination of the submandibular gland (Fig. 5 ), staining orange-red on Congo Red staining (Fig. 6 ), with green-colored birefringence observed under polarizing microscopy. Relapse of lymphoma and a diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma were obtained from the mass in the right lung, with amyloid deposition also observed in the lymphoma cells (Fig. 7 ). Regarding the lungs, follow-up was carried out by chest CT due to the low malignancy of the lymphoma, while symptomatic treatment by oral care was continued in our department for oral dryness. "
426,S0936-6555(13)00200-8,Is There a Role for Radiotherapy in the Primary Management of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma? A Single-centre Case Series," Materials and Methods All patients who had undergone surgical intervention for a central nervous system lymphoma for the 10 year period between January 2001 and December 2010 were identified using the reporting database of the Department of Neuropathology. Cases were excluded if they were transferred to another centre for treatment postoperatively, if they had systemic lymphoma at staging or if they developed systemic lymphoma within 6 months of diagnosis. In all cases included in this review, the original pathology sections were retrieved and assessed by two independent pathologists to confirm the diagnosis. Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and the statistical program R 2.15.2, run on Windows, were used for data analysis; survival curves were generated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Case notes and electronic systems were reviewed retrospectively to ascertain details of each case. Information gathered included performance status at presentation, presenting symptoms and any associated risk factors. In addition, detail on routine staging investigations was recorded, namely magnetic resonance imaging brain and spine, fundoscopy, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, computed tomography to rule out systemic lymphoma and bone marrow examination. Although some centres also recommend testicular ultrasound, this was not our standard practise. Therapeutic data collected included the surgical procedure carried out, the subsequent intended treatment and any deviation from this. Overall survival was calculated from the date of initial surgical intervention to the date of death, or censored at the time of data collection (5 October 2011). Any neurological deficit attested to in clinic letters during the follow-up period was recorded. "

433,S0272-6386(10)01146-7,The Spectrum of Kidney Involvement in Lymphoma: A Case Report and Review of the Literature," Case Report  Clinical History and Initial Laboratory Data A 76-year-old man was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of kidney failure. Two months prior, he had developed progressive swelling of the extremities, abdomen, and scrotum. Laboratory testing showed a serum creatinine level of 4.6 mg/dL (406.6 ?mol/L) and nephrotic-range proteinuria. A faint immunoglobulin G ? monoclonal M spike was noted on serum protein electrophoresis, and a small quantity of free ? light chains was found on urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with 4%-5% plasma cells. Minimal change disease was diagnosed empirically, and treatment with methylprednisolone, 250 mg/d, was started. The patient's kidney function continued to decline, and he was transferred for further workup. The patient had a 10-year history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Serum creatinine level had been 1.3 mg/dL (114.9 ?mol/L) 3 months before admission. He recently had stopped smoking. He was retired and lived with his wife in northern Massachusetts. Family history was negative for kidney disease or malignancy. He denied recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation was 95% on 3 L of oxygen. Examination was notable for expiratory wheezes and decreased bibasilar breath sounds. Cardiac examination findings were unremarkable. Ascites was present, and his scrotum was markedly swollen. He had pitting edema (3+) to the presacrum symmetrically. There were no palpable lymph nodes. Initial laboratory data showed the following values: serum sodium, 139 mEq/L; potassium, 4.8 mEq/L; chloride, 103 mEq/L; bicarbonate, 25 mEq/L; urea nitrogen, 92 mg/dL (32.8 mmol/L); creatinine, 5.0 mg/dL (442 ?mol/L); calcium, 7.0 mg/dL; and albumin, 2.6 g/dL. Proteinuria was quantified at protein excretion of 19.5 g/d. Urine microscopic examination of a catheterized specimen was significant for numerous nondysmorphic red blood cells and frequent pigmented granular casts. Serum leukocyte count was 7,500/?L (7.5 × 109/L), with normal differential. Hemoglobin level was 9.8 g/dL (98 g/L), and platelet count was 95 × 103/?L (95 × 109/L). A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed a variably cellular marrow, with approximately 15% lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates. On ultrasound, both kidneys appeared enlarged, but structurally normal, measuring 14.2 and 14.5 cm in length. A computed tomography–guided kidney biopsy was performed.   Kidney Biopsy The kidney biopsy specimen showed evidence of widespread acute and chronic changes. Severe glomerular visceral epithelial cell injury with diffuse foot-process effacement was seen on electron microscopy (Fig 1), suggesting minimal change disease. Basement membrane thickness was normal, and electron-dense deposits were absent. Evidence of acute tubular distension and epithelial lining attenuation consistent with acute tubular necrosis also was present. There was prominent focal infiltration of the kidney parenchyma and subcapsular tissue with small monomorphic lymphocytes, especially near arterioles (Fig 2). Although a small sample size precluded further characterization of the infiltrate, the lack of prominent nucleoli and mitotic figures was most consistent with low-grade lymphoma. Chronic changes also were observed: global glomerulosclerosis was seen in approximately 40% of glomeruli (14 total in the sample; Fig 3). There also was moderately severe arterial and arteriolar sclerosis, compatible with chronic vascular disease. Immunofluorescence microscopy results were negative (not shown).   Diagnosis Minimal change disease concurrent with lymphoplasmacytic invasion of the renal parenchyma.   Clinical Follow-up Treatment with rituximab, dexamethasone, and bortozemib was initiated. The patient responded rapidly: proteinuria decreased to protein excretion of 9.4 g/d, and creatinine level improved to 1.2 mg/dL (203.3 ?mol/L) on discharge 1 week later. Subsequently, he underwent 2 additional rounds of chemotherapy. Ten months after diagnosis, the lymphoma remains in remission. Serum creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL (106.1 ?mol/L), and he has urinary protein excretion of 1.3 g/d.  "
441,S0915-6992(10)00059-2,Burkitt's lymphoma in a patient presenting with inferior alveolar nerve hypoesthesia in the absence of a regional tumor: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 16-year-old man presented with mental hypoesthesia and occlusal pain. The patient had been slightly feverish with symptoms suggestive of left-sided mental nerve paralysis since October 2007. He examined and antibiotics were administered at offices of pediatrics and otorhinolaryngology, with no improvement. He was referred to us on November 5, 2007, from the otorhinolaryngology department of our hospital because of bilateral spread of the paralysis. Systemic examination indicated as follows: body temperature, 37.1°C; moderate physique; favorable nutritional status. Extraoral findings demonstrated bilaterally symmetrical facial contour; a palpable 5mm in diameter and mobile lymph node in the left submandibular region which was non-tender to palpation, and hypoesthesia of the skin in the mental region bilaterally. Intraoral examination showed no abnormal findings in the oral mucosa, gingiva, or teeth on inspection (Fig. 1 ), hypoesthesia of the labial gingiva between the mental foramina and of the labial mucosa, degree-3 vertical mobility of the mandibular molar teeth bilateral and maxillary molar tooth on the left side, and a periodontal pocket size of 3mm or less. There were no signs of periodontitis. In the electrical dental pulp vitality test with Denttest™ TB09 (Medinale/Switzerland), none of the mandibular teeth other than the right lateral incisor, left central incisor and second molar showed vital reaction; as for the maxillary teeth, some showed vital reaction while others showed no vital reaction. Thus, it was impossible to detect the localized reaction with these data. Family history is non-contributory.  2.1 Present illness Dental and panoramic radiographic examinations revealed slight loss or thinning of lamina dura and destruction of alveolar crestal bone in molar and premolar region of the mandible (Fig. 2 ). The CT images showed bilateral symmetry of the jaw and absence of bone destruction of either the maxilla or the mandible. T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images also indicated no abnormality in the signal intensity of the bone marrow. These three image findings did not corresponded to osteomyelitis or malignant tumor of the jaw which was suspected at first from the clinical symptoms. Serum CRP and LDH levels were elevated (7.39mg/dl and 613IU/L, respectively) and the LDH-2 and -3 isozymes were predominant in laboratory findings. After examinations described above, a preliminary diagnosis of malignancy of a hematopoietic organ was suspected. We immediately referred the patient to the department of hematology. Since there were no serious systemic symptoms such as high fever, weight loss or night sweats at the time of examination at the department, the clinical course was observed. However, the patient revealed loss of appetite and malaise probably associated with the low-grade fever ranging from 37 to 38°C, and headache. Moreover, the patient also had difficulty in gait, perhaps because of the continuous pain in the four extremities and back. He was admitted to our department on an emergency basis on November 19, i.e., 14 days after the initial examination at our department. A repeat laboratory study revealed that the serum CRP and LDH levels were increased even further to 17.39mg/dl and 1027IU/L, respectively, and that the serum level of soluble IL-2 receptor, an indicator of cell proliferation in malignant tumors of hematopoietic organs, was also elevated (2510U/ml). As a part of more detailed evaluation, 59mTc scintigraphy and 67Ga scintigraphy were performed, and the results still showed the absence of any abnormal accumulation in the maxilla and mandible. However, 99mTc scintigram indicated accumulation in the proximal left humerus, and 67Ga scintigram revealed abnormal accumulation in the systemic bone marrow and kidneys (Fig. 3 ). Based on these findings, malignant lymphoma was strongly suspected, and the patient was examined again at the department of hematology. Immediately upon arrival at the latter, an ilium bone marrow puncture was performed. Examination of the bone marrow aspirate revealed moderate to slightly large-sized heterotypic lymphocytes with a high N/C ratio in 56.6%; the nucleoreticulum was coarse and rough, nucleoli were distinct, and the cytoplasm was strongly basic. Small vacuoles were present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 ). Immunological examination revealed negative staining for CD3, BCL-2 and EBER ISH and immunopositivity for CD10, CD20 and CD79a. The positivity ratio for MIB-1 was also approximately 100% (Fig. 5 ). Based on these findings and observations, the patient was diagnosed as case of Burkitt's lymphoma, clinical stage IV B. On November 24, the patient was transferred to the department of hematology and received four cycles of the following two types of combined therapy including rituximab [R] given alternately; R-hyper CVAD (R, cyclophosphamide [CPA], vincristine [VCR], doxorubicin [DXR] and dexamethasone [DEXA]) and R-HDMTX/Ara-C (R, methotrexate [MTX], and cytarabine [Ara-C]). In regard to the latter treatment, each patient received an intrathecal injection of MTX and Ara-C on days 3 and 9, with the aim of preventing infiltration of the central nervous system. One year after chemotherapy, intraoral examination revealed, as at the time of the initial examination, normal gingival condition on inspection. After one course of chemotherapy, the mobility of the teeth improved to the normal range. Dental and panoramic X-rays showed normal lamina dura and alveolar crestal ridge (Fig. 6 ). The mental hypoesthesia on the right side resolved completely, while that on the left side mental hypoesthesia showed partial improvement. Electrical pulp reaction testing revealed complete resolution of the vital reaction of the maxillary teeth, with the mandibular teeth, excluding the anterior teeth and the left molar tooth, showing a tendency toward improvement. The lymphadenopathy of the anterior mediastinal lymph nodes, revealed by the chest CT obtained before chemotherapy, subsided completely. Repeated bone marrow aspiration revealed reduction in the number of heterotypic lymphocytes, and at present, there is still no evidence of recurrence for 2 years and 1 month after the treatment.  "
445,S0344-0338(10)00181-0,Concomitant adenocarcinoma and colonic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a patient with ulcerative colitis: A case report and molecular analysis," Clinical history The patient was a 64-year-old female. She was found to have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at the age of 50. She was given no drugs, because her symptoms caused by RA were mild. She was also diagnosed as having UC at the age of 52 years. Owing to the diagnosis of UC, she had been given prednisolone (10mg/day) for 12 years, resulting in relief of the symptoms. The patient had increased anemia, and had suffered from bloody diarrhea for 3 months. She was referred to our hospital for detailed investigation of anemia and bloody diarrhea. At the time of administration, her red blood cells and hemoglobin were slightly decreased (RBC: 378×104/mm3, Hb: 9.7g/dl), but other examinations of peripheral blood and bone marrow revealed no abnormality. Markers for cancer or lymphoma were as follows: CEA, 1.3mg/ml; CA19-9, 18U/ml; sIL2R, 1140/ml. A chest X-ray, computer tomography, and ultrasonography revealed no abdominal masses, lymphadenopathy, or hepato-splenomegaly. Colonoscopic examination showed 2 lesions protruding into the sigmoid colon and multiple lesions protruding into the cecum, as well as into the ascending and transverse colon. These lesions were biopsied, and an existence of adenocarcinomas and lymphoma in the colon was suspected. One month after the colonoscopy, she was operated on for total colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis. Postoperatively, she underwent combination chemotherapy. Both tumors did not recur during the following 6 years. "
449,S0022-510X(16)30542-1,An autopsy case of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma with subcortical U-fiber sparing and unique lymphocyte markers," 2 Case report A 65-year-old man, who worked as a security guard, developed abnormal behaviors such as forgetting his work day, having a car accident, and fainting in a bathroom from the beginning of January 2014. He vomited repeatedly and admitted to the local hospital on the 38th day of illness. From the 43rd day, he received physical restraints due to repeated intentions to pull out his ileus tube, and then developed progressive consciousness impairment from the 45th day. A brain MRI was performed on the 57th day, which showed multiple T2 of high intensity white matter (WM) lesions in the cerebellum, deep WM, and subcortical WM (Fig. 1A, left column). Some lesions presented strong signals in diffusion weighted images (Fig. 1A, right column). On the 66th day, a neurologist was consulted, and he was transferred to our hospital immediately. On admission to our hospital, he was in a stupor (Japan coma scale II-30 and Glasgow coma scale E2V1M3) and presented unstable breathing with hiccups but no skin rash. His vital signs presented a body temperature of 37.0°C, and normal blood pressure (BP 101/68mmHg) with a regular rhythm (64/min). His lung and heart sounds were normal. An arterial blood gas test revealed mild hypoxemia with a slight respiratory alkalosis (pH7.44, PaO2 86.3mmHg, PaCO2 36.3mmHg, HCO3? 24.6mEq/l, AaDO2 18). A brain MRI on admission showed expanding T2 high lesions in the cerebellum, thalamus, deep WM and subcortical WM (Fig. 1B, the first column) with a strong signal in the diffusion-weighted images (Fig. 1B, the second column), partially restricted diffusion in ADC map images (Fig. 1B, an arrowhead in the third column), and microbleeds in the T2* weighted images (Fig. 1B, an arrow in the rightmost column). No lesions showed gadolinium (Gd) enhancement. Laboratory data revealed a moderate increase of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 78/111mm), mild increases of CRP (1.1mg/dl) and liver enzymes (AST 68IU/l, ALT 69IU/l, ALP 349IU/l, LDH 324IU/l), a moderate decrease of albumin (2.7mg/dl), normal electrolyte and thyroid hormone levels, a mild increase of serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R, 952U/ml; normal value, 122–496U/ml), and negative anti-HIV antibody. No tumor markers were elevated such as CEA, CA19-9, and NSE. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a normal cell count (2/?l, 100% monocytes) without any malignant cells, an increase in protein (100mg/dl), normal glucose (61mg/dl), and mild increases of the IgG index (0.65) and ?2-microgloblin (3.45mg/l; normal value 0.9–2.0mg/l). Chest and abdominal X-rays showed mild bronchopneumonia. A whole body computed tomography (CT) showed no evident ileus and lymphadenopathy. Since the patient presented irregular breathing, a tracheal tube was intubated on the night of his admission. Differential diagnostic candidates for acute progressive diffuse leukoencephalopathy without Gd enhancement are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), CNS lymphoma, intravascular lymphoma (IVL), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and primary angiitis of CNS. Upon admission to our hospital, the patient's general condition was too severe to permit a brain biopsy. He was tentatively treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy (1000mg/day for 3days). After this steroid treatment, his respiratory status improved slightly and he was withdrawn from mechanical ventilation. The second mPSL pulse therapy began from the 8th hospital day, but his general condition did not improve further. A brain MRI performed on the 13th hospital day showed a lesion progression (Fig. 1C). His respiratory status worsened again on the 18th hospital day, and he died after respiratory failure on the next day. An autopsy was performed 5h after his death. "
454,S2451-9936(17)30118-4,Isolated orbital mass as the primary presentation of a triple-hit lymphoma transformed from a systemic follicular lymphoma," 2 Discussion Double- and triple-hit lymphomas are high-grade B-cell lymphomas harboring MYC rearrangement and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. 3  These lymphomas often show morphologic features overlapping between DLBCL and BL. 3  They are highly aggressive and refractory to chemotherapy. 5  ,  6  Triple-hit lymphomas are rare, and may occur de novo or transform from low-grade lymphomas, most commonly follicular lymphoma. In a study of 11 patients with triple-hit lymphoma, 4 patients (36%) had a history or concurrent follicular lymphoma, and 5 patients (45%) died within a year. Involvement of extranodal sites included bone marrow, spleen, tonsil, bladder and testicle, and no orbital involvement was reported. 6   We report a patient with unusual clinical presentations of a triple-hit lymphoma transformed from systemic FL. The transformation presented as an isolated orbital mass after 9-year remission of FL, and the patient had no B symptoms or significantly elevated LDH to cause clinical suspicion of transformation. Subsequent work-up demonstrated only focal uptake in lymph nodes on PET-CT, and bone marrow staging showed <5% involvement by a low-grade FL. It is important to perform FISH analysis on large B-cell lymphoma as double- or triple-hit lymphomas require more aggressive chemotherapy. Additionally, discordant histology occurs in up to 50% of DLBCL between bone marrow and extramedullary sites, most commonly characterized by low-grade FL in the bone marrow but DLBCL in the extramedullary sites, as exemplified in this case. Therefore, extramedullary tissue biopsy is important in assessment of lymphoma, particularly for possible progression or transformation of low-grade lymphoma. DLBCL is typically treated by R-CHOP chemotherapy. However, double- or triple-hit lymphomas are highly aggressive, and no standard treatment has been established. Our patient was treated with R-ICE and R-GD followed by a two-year maintenance on rituximab. She was in remission for three years but died of cardiac failure. In conclusion, we presented an unusual case of transformation of FL to a high-grade, triple-hit B-cell lymphoma that presented as an isolated orbital mass without systemic symptoms, significant lymphadenopathy or concordant large cell lymphoma in the bone marrow. Biopsy of the orbital mass served as the initial recognition of the triple-hit lymphoma transformed from the FL after 9 years in remission. Early recognition of these high-grade B-cell lymphomas is important for prompt treatment. Although these patients are often refractory to current chemotherapy, rapidly emerging immunotherapeutic approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T-cell therapy), may become an effective therapeutic option for patients with high grade B-cell lymphoma.

Clinical information on four cases was obtained from electronic consultation records and from the London Regional Cancer Centre Program. One referred case was submitted without clinical data.   2.2 Laboratory studies All sections of primary and relapsed material were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), and Congo red stain. Selected slides of each case were stained with a battery of immunohistochemical stains. CD3, CD5, CD10, CD20, CD23, CD43, Bcl2, Bcl6, kappa, lambda and cyclinD1 immunostains (supplied by DAKO Denmark) were variably applied in each case. Antibody titers and antigen retrieval methods were based on the manufacture manual. All antibodies were polyclonal, with the exception of kappa, lambda and CD3 (monoclonal antibodies). Flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter FC500, 5 colour, CXP software) was available on 4 of the 5 cases and cytogenetic studies (chromosomal karyotype) were available on case #3.

473,S2210-2612(16)30404-7,A Case Series of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and burkitt lymphoma presenting with peritoneal lymphomatosis," 2 Presentation of case  Case #1: A 29-year-old male presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain localized in the upper abdomen, weight loss of 10–15 pounds within the three weeks of presentation, and increased sweating particularly in the evenings, which were all preceded by diplopia. Vitals were within normal physiological limits except for an O2 saturation of 92%. Abdominal examination showed epigastric tenderness with moderated abdominal distension and occasional high-pitched bowel sounds. Decreased inward gaze of the left eye along with miosis was noted. The remainder of the physical exam was normal along with laboratory values except for a white blood cell count of 12,800/mm3 and a platelet count of 582,000/mm3. CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed irregular thickening of the gastric wall with involvement of the body and antrum, an exophytic mass at the gastric fundus, and extensive nodularity on the omentum. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed an ulcerative tumor at the distal stomach. Subsequent biopsy undertaken showed high-grade malignant B-cell NHL ? DLBCL or Burkitt lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry staining showed: pankeratin-, CD20+, CD10+, MUM1+, BCL6+, BCL2-, CD3+, CD5+, EBER ISH-, and Ki67 near 100%. Laparoscopy with biopsy conducted verified c-MYC translocation confirming Burkitt lymphoma. Other procedures included a CT guided bone marrow biopsy and X-Ray (XR) guided spinal tap that were negative for malignancy, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and a whole body PET scan showed no abnormalities.  Case # 2: A 46-year-old male presented with abdominal pain localized in his left lower quadrant (LLQ) of ten days duration and weight loss of 100 pounds for the past nine months. On examination the patient was in mild distress with mild tenderness on the LLQ and dyspnea at times. Laboratory examination was within normal limits. CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was suggestive for diffuse peritoneal involvement with subsequent CT guided core needle biopsy confirming DLBC—germinal type. Immunohistochemistry staining showed: GCET1+, FOXP1+, CD10+, CD20+, BCL6+, BCL2-, CD3- pankeratin-, MUM1-, and EBER ISH-. A CT guided thoracentesis was conducted for dyspnea due to pleural effusion. The cytology showed few atypical cells and reactive mesothelial cells.  Case # 3: A 67-year-old female presented with severe abdominal pain localized in the LLQ, bloating, distension, flank pain, unintentional weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Physical exam showed diffuse tenderness in the LLQ, a fluid thrill/shifting dullness, and palpable irregular nodularities localized in the LLQ. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed diffuse omental and mesenteric carcinomatosis with metastatic implants extending into the posterior mediastinum via diaphragmatic hiatus, and an irregular satellite mass of 7.9cm. A CT guided core biopsy showed malignancy consistent with DLBCL ? germinal type. Subsequent XR spinal tap with cerebrospinal fluid cytology times two showed no evidence of malignancy. All three patients were started on Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy, the standard of care for DLBCL. Methotrexate and Cytarabine administration was interspersed throughout these cycles. In the end, the patient in case two and three received a total of eight cycles of treatment. In case one, the patient received an initial single treatment dose of R-CHOP therapy. After confirmation of Burkitt lymphoma, the patient was switched to Rituximab ? hyperfractionated Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Doxorubicin, and Dexamethasone with alternating Methotrexate and Cytarabine (R-HCVAD/MA). A total of 4 cycles was administered for this patient. During treatment, patients encountered mild side effects from the drugs such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Abdominal symptoms in all three cases subsided, no resistance to the chemotherapeutic regimen was reported, and no other major side effects were noted. All patients completed treatment with documentation of complete regression of disease along with improvement of quality of life. "
474,S1043-4666(12)00669-2,Pretreatment circulating serum cytokines associated with follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A clinic-based case-control study," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study population Participants in the studies provided written informed consent. The studies were reviewed and approved by the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Iowa. FL and DLBCL case patients were from the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic SPORE Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). Briefly, newly diagnosed lymphoma patients were prospectively enrolled into the MER and the diagnosis was confirmed by the study hematopathologist (WRM) in all cases [22]. Patients selected for this analysis were diagnosed with FL or DLBCL from 2002 to 2008 and had a pre-treatment serum sample available. Controls were obtained from an ongoing case-control study of lymphoma [21]. Controls were selected from patients visiting the Mayo Clinic Department of Medicine for a pre-scheduled general medical examination, and eligibility requirements were age 18years or older and a resident of Minnesota, Iowa or Wisconsin, and no prior history of lymphoma, leukemia or HIV infection. Controls were frequency matched to the Mayo cases by 5-year age group, gender, and distance from Rochester, Minnesota. All controls were enrolled over the same timeframe as the cases.   2.2 Serum cytokine assay Serum cytokines were measured from pre-treatment blood draws using a multiplex ELISA (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) as previously described [20]. Thirty cytokines, including pro-inflammatory, Th1 and Th2 associated cytokines, were analyzed using the Luminex-100 system Version 1.7 (Luminex, Austin, TX). The following cytokines were tested – EGF (epidermal growth factor), eotaxin, FGF-2 (basic fibroblast growth factor), GM-CSF (granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor), G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor), HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), IFN (interferon alpha), IFN (interferon gamma), IL-2 (interleukin-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-12p40, sIL-2R (interleukin-2 receptor), IL-1RA (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist), IL-1 (interleukin-1 beta), MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1), IP-10 (inducible protein 10/CXCL10), MIG (monokine induced by interferon?/CXCL9), MIP-1 (CCL3), MIP-1b (CCL4), RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted/CCL5), TNF (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Data were acquired using STar Station software (Applied Cytometry, Dinnington, Sheffield, UK) and analysis was performed using the MasterPlex QT 1.0 system (MiraiBio, Alameda, CA). Samples were randomly assigned to plates, stratified by case (DLBCL and FL) and control status, so that each plate was mixture of cases and controls. Each cytokine was examined graphically for batch effects by plate; control distributions were consistent across plates for cytokines with distributions above the limit of detection, therefore no batch adjustment was made during the analyses. Inter-assay variation was assessed by inclusion of an internal control serum on all assay plates; the CV for the internal control log2 cytokine values across plates ranged from 0.3% (RANTES) to 12.2% (IL-6).   2.3 Statistical analysis We used unconditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association of serum cytokine concentrations with risk of FL or DLBCL, adjusting for age and sex. Serums with undetectable cytokines were assigned a value of the limit of detection divided by (LOD/2). Cytokine levels were modeled as ordinal variables corresponding to the tertile cut points among the controls, with the lowest group serving as the reference. However, if fewer than 2/3 of the control levels were above the LOD, then samples falling below LOD were the referent group and the median cut point was used for the remaining samples with detectable levels. We calculated a one-degree of freedom trend test, using the original scoring of the cytokine grouping, and statistical significance was declared for p <0.05. We used polytomous logistic regression to assess heterogeneity between FL and DLBCL, and calculated a one-degree of freedom Wald test to assess heterogeneity in the trend tests between DLBCL and FL; statistical significance was declared for q-values <0.05 to account for multiple testing. All analyses were performed using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). To assess cytokines simultaneously, we used principal components analysis (PCA). PCA was performed on the combined FL and control samples and repeated on the combined DLBCL and control samples, agnostic to case or control status for both datasets. The top principal components were then examined graphically to explore patterns between cases and controls. We additionally calculated q-values to account for multiple testing. JMP v9.0.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to create correlation graphs.  "
476,S0190-9622(16)00011-6,Cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL): A comparative clinical feature and survival outcome analysis of 52 cases according to primary tumor site,"Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is the proliferation of predominantly large lymphoid cells with a strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 and a characteristic growth pattern. Three entities of ALCL have been identified: primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)+ ALCL, primary systemic ALK? ALCL, and primary cutaneous ALCL. Primary systemic ALCL accounts for 2% to 3% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and primary cutaneous ALCL accounts for approximately 9% of cutaneous lymphomas. 1-7  Primary cutaneous ALCL is frequently negative for ALK, with rare cases displaying ALK positivity. Although ALK expression in the skin indicates systemic disease, some well-documented ALK+ primary cutaneous ALCL cases have been reported. 8  The prognosis of primary cutaneous ALCL is excellent, with a reported 5-year survival ranging from 85% to 100%. 9-11  "
479,S1878-8750(15)01722-2,Neuroinflammation Preceding and Accompanying Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma: Case Study and Literature Review," Case Description  History and Initial Pathologic Examination A 44-year-old woman presented in May 2012 initially with right hand numbness for 3 months. Her past medical history included hypertension and laser eye surgery. In July 2012, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without contrast following computed tomography (CT), disclosed several subcortical white matter (WM) signal abnormalities in the left frontoparietal lobe, left temporal lobe, trigone of the left lateral ventricle, and a large focus of signal abnormality in the right cerebellum. Neurologic examination in August 2012 revealed minimal neurologic abnormalities, mainly slight weakness of the finger extensors and right arm hyperreflexia. Repeat MRI with contrast in August 2012 exhibited a slight increase in size of the left frontal lesion with nodular enhancement, unchanged appearance of the left periventricular lesion, and less prominence of the right cerebellar lesion (Figure 1A  and B). In October 2012, cerebrospinal fluid electrophoresis showed no oligoclonal pattern. She pursued a course of alternative therapy. It was noted that she was well until May 2014, when she developed vertigo and gait ataxia. She was then hospitalized for 2 weeks. Neurologic examination revealed unsteady tandem gait. MRI demonstrated multiple lesions including a T2-hyperintense lesion (2.5 × 1.5 cm, with irregular enhancement) in the cerebellar vermis extending to the margins of the fourth ventricle, a contrast-enhancing focus (1.8 × 0.7 cm, but smaller than that seen on MRI in August 2012) in the left paracentral gyrus, and a T2-hyperintense focus (with minimal enhancement) in the right frontal lobe (Figure 1C and D). Flow cytometry indicated no phenotypic abnormality in the lymphoid subsets; cytology was negative for malignant cells. Given the radiologic suspicion of neoplasm, she underwent a suboccipital craniotomy. Microscopic examination of the submitted cerebellar tissue showed active inflammation with marked loss of both Luxol fast blue staining for myelin and neurofilament protein immunostaining for axons, as well as abundant infiltration of inflammatory cells including frequent CD68+ macrophages/microglia and CD3+ T cells, but infrequent CD20+ B cells (Figure 1E–J). There were also frequent CD4+ T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, with marked decrease in CD4/CD8+ cell ratio (<1 largely). Head CT scans on postoperative days 1, 4, and 46 showed a partial resection of the cerebellar lesion and decreased sizes of the supratentorial lesions. She continued to pursue alternative therapies such as acupuncture and ginger, in addition to taking meclizine and heparin, with gradual improvement. At the time of discharge in June 2014, she had no neurologic deficits. In October 2014, she presented again with a 3-week history of vertigo, headache, nausea, and vomiting. She became amnestic with increasing somnolence and decreased mobility. Neurologic examination revealed 10/30 of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, as well as ataxia of her right arm and leg. Cerebrospinal fluid examination exhibited 11 white blood cells (WBC) and 3.13 g/L of protein (normal: 0.15?0.45 g/L), with no oligoclonal banding; repeat cytology showed increased numbers of inflammatory cells but no evidence of malignancy. MRI displayed many new enhancing lesions including a 1.3-cm nodule medially in the left thalamus and a 1.2-cm nodule in the posterior superior left thalamus, with dramatic surrounding edema and modest hydrocephalus but no new contrast-enhancing lesion in the cerebellum (Figure 1K and L). She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by prednisone. Her ataxia improved, and MoCA performance was increased to 21/30. She received regular prednisone and methotrexate treatment. In December 2014, she was hospitalized again because of a worsening productive cough for 2 weeks. She received intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by prednisone and mycophenolate. She had symptomatic improvement, but in January 2015, she developed worsening gait, upper motor neuron findings in the right hand, worsening dysmetria, and recurrent decreased level of consciousness. Her course was further complicated by seizures that were treated by antiepileptic drugs and obstructive hydrocephalus that was treated with a right occipital ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. MRI disclosed increased lesions within the hypothalamic, medial temporal, and anterior frontal regions bilaterally, as well as new lesions in the left caudate head and left medial temporal lobe, along with increased right-to-left shift. Following cranial CT disclosed extensive intraventricular hemorrhage and moderate dilation of the lateral ventricles. Repeat CT a week later showed slightly decreased size of intraventricular hemorrhage and less ventricular dilation. The last MRI in February 2015 showed evolving parenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhage, extensive abnormal parenchymal signals with contrast enhancement mostly within the thalamus, lentiform nuclei, and hypothalamus bilaterally but no new contrast-enhancing lesion in the cerebellum (Figure 1M and N). Repeated rounds of various investigations following her second presentation in October 2014 did not reveal other CNS or systemic infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. Despite the extensive immunosuppressive therapy, she continued to worsen and became persistently comatose. She received palliative care and died in February 2015.   Postmortem Examination A general autopsy revealed patchy bronchopneumonia of the right lower lobe but no evidence of systemic malignancy or inflammatory process. The brain weighed 1191 grams. Its gross abnormalities included evidence of the surgical interventions, intraventricular blood clots, and multiple small foci of hemorrhage (Figure 2A ), as well as multifocal dark-tan discoloration preferentially within the left frontal lobes, left temporal lobe, bilateral basal ganglia, thalamus, and subthalamus (Figure 2A and C). Microscopic examination disclosed 2 major distinct pathologic processes. One was the aggregation of atypical lymphoid cells in many brain regions including most areas of the cerebellum (other than the previous resection site), brainstem at multiple levels, bilateral basal ganglia, thalami and hypothalami, cingulate gyri with extension into the corpus callosum, left hippocampus, and medial temporal, left frontal, right frontal, and right occipital lobes. The atypical lymphoid cells were large and discohesive, with pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli, and diffusely immunoreactive for CD20 (Figure 2B). MIB-1 proliferation index was markedly high and focally up to 80%. Epstein-Barr-virus immunostaining was negative. The other process was active inflammation identified in a few brain regions including the previous cerebellar resection site and right optic tract. Isolated infiltrating, atypical CD20+ B cells were found identified in the other cerebellar regions, distinct from the previous resection site (Figure 2D and E), but almost absent in the right optic tract focus (Figure 2F–J). These inflammatory foci were pathologically similar to those of the previous resection, with large loss of both Luxol fast blue staining and neurofilament protein immunostaining, suggestive of a predominantly destructive process (Figure 2F–J).

482,S2352-5126(18)30010-9,A case of genital pyoderma gangrenosum successfully treated with cyclosporine without relapse of established follicular lymphoma,"A 64-year-old woman with stage IV follicular B-cell lymphoma in stable partial remission after 8 cycles of chemotherapy (including rituximab), had painful vulvo-vaginal and perianal erosions. These rapidly progressed to frank ulceration with extensive destruction of vulvar architecture. She had severe vulvar pain without additional systemic or gastrointestinal symptoms and raised inflammatory markers. Empirical treatment for candidal, bacterial, and herpetic infection had no benefit. Repeated cultures of swabs and skin biopsies were negative for viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal causes of ulceration; syphilis serology was negative. Computed tomography found stable lymphoma in partial remission, intact anal sphincter with no fistula formation, and no new malignancy. Examination under anaesthesia confirmed rectal and urethral integrity despite extensive deep ulceration of the vulva and perianal skin (Fig 1 ). The differential diagnosis at this point was wide but included aphthous ulceration, autoimmune blistering disease (especially in the setting of hematologic malignancy), and PG. Skin biopsies found nonspecific epidermal ulceration with abscess formation but without evidence of vasculitis, malignancy, or lymphoma. An inflammatory infiltrate extended into the subcutaneous adipose tissue comprising neutrophils, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and few eosinophils (Figs 2 and 3  ). The adjacent epidermis showed prominent irregular acanthosis with spongiosis and acute inflammation, but papillary dermal edema was not seen. There was no granuloma formation. Viral cytopathic changes or fungal elements were not seen, and a PAS stain was negative for fungi. Deeper levels found no additional features. There was no evidence of malignancy, polarizable foreign material was not seen, there was no evidence of koilocytosis, and special stains for micro-organisms were all negative. Immunohistochemistry findings for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 were also negative. The case was further discussed at the dermatopathology multidisciplinary meeting, and it was felt that the most likely diagnosis, given the clinical picture, histology, microbiology, and immunohistochemistry was PG. Genital PG was diagnosed, assumed secondary to her lymphoma. After discussion with hematology colleagues, it was established that her lymphoma would require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to effect cure and would carry significant risk. Anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy for her PG was considered; however, because of uncertainty regarding potential effect on tumor biology, consensus opinion was that a better risk/benefit profile would be obtained by treating her PG with cyclosporine and corticosteroids and monitoring her lymphoma for relapse. Our patient responded rapidly to therapy with prednisolone, 0.6 mg/kg/d, cyclosporine, 3 mg/kg/d, and minocycline, 100 mg/d. By week 7 she was fully healed with scarring (Fig 4 ). Prednisolone was successfully tapered to 7.5 mg/d over 18 weeks. However, subsequent attempts at tapering cyclosporine to less than 1 mg/kg/d resulted in relapses, characterized by copious nonoffensive sterile discharge and superficial erosions, which responded each time to increased cyclosporine dose. Her lymphoma remains stable on serial imaging over 30 months with no further recurrence of PG on relatively low-maintenance-dose cyclosporine (1 mg/kg/d). Complications during therapy included mild adrenal suppression, pulmonary embolism, and mild (stable) renal impairment. The long-term impact of cyclosporine on her lymphoma prognosis is uncertain, and she is undergoing close follow-up by the hematology service. With close clinical surveillance, radiologically and serologically, she has remained well and symptom free without progression of her follicular lymphoma."
483,S0959-8049(15)01135-1,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with MYC gene rearrangements Current perspective on treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with MYC gene rearrangements; case series and review of the literature," 2 Review of literature  2.1 DLBCL, B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable (BCL-U), normal MYC function and MYC aberrations DLBCL comprises about 35% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and is the most common lymphoma subtype. BCL-U (with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma) is a new entity in the World Health Organisation classification of 2008 and comprises about 5% of NHL. Current treatment of patients with DLBCL and BCL-U consists of six cycles of R-CHOP followed by two administrations of rituximab or eight cycles of R-CHOP [6–8]. With this treatment, the prognosis varies depending on the clinical IPI score, ranging from a 3 year OS of 59% for patients with a high IPI score, to 91% for patients with IPI score 0 or 1 [2]. However, within every IPI subgroup there is still considerable variation in prognosis, reflecting underlying biological differences. Staudt et al. used gene expression profiling to define two molecular subtypes of DLBCL based on the cell of origin (COO) of the lymphoma: the activated B-cell (ABC subtype) and the germinal centre B-cell (GCB subtype) [9]. Patients with GCB subtype have a better prognosis with CHOP and R-CHOP treatment than patients with ABC subtype (OS at 2 years 80% versus 40% and OS at 3 year 85% versus 69%, respectively [10,11]). Furthermore, in recent years numerous studies have shown that the presence of a rearrangement of the MYC gene results in an inferior prognosis following treatment with R-CHOP [3,12,13]. Under normal conditions MYC acts as an early response gene: activation of many membrane receptor complexes result in activation of the MYC gene. The transcribed MYC protein forms a heterodimer with MYC-associated factor X, and binds to the promoter region of his target genes, regulating the transcription of 10–15% of genes, involved in diverse functions, such as cell proliferation, cell growth and DNA replication. Also apoptosis and micro-RNAs are regulated by MYC [14,15]. Interestingly, MYC does not bind to promoters of silent genes. Therefore, activation of MYC only stimulates the already active program in a cell. This may explain why the effects of high MYC expression are diverse in different cell types.  MYC gene rearrangements as determined by FISH, may lead to upregulation of the MYC gene and subsequently high MYC protein expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, upregulation of the MYC protein can also be the result of other processes (like mutations or post-transcriptional changes).   2.2 Clinical outcome of DLBCL patients with MYC aberrations Chromosomal rearrangements involving the MYC gene (MYC+ lymphoma) are reported in 10% (4–16%) of DLBCL cases and in 30–50 % of BCL-U cases [5]. Of these, 33% have a single MYC rearrangement (SH) but in 67% of cases other rearrangements are also involved: the BCL2 and/or the BCL6 gene (DH or TH lymphoma) [16]. Morphologically, immunophenotypically, and clinically, there are no unique features that will identify MYC+ lymphoma. The prognosis of these patients is significantly worse when compared to the MYC–patients (OS at 2 years 35% for MYC+ versus 61% for MYC– patients) [3]. Moreover, also after salvage therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (preceded by R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, carboplatin) or R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabin, cisplatin)), outcome of relapsed and refractory MYC+ patients remains poor with an OS of only 29% after 4 years versus 62% for MYC– patients [12]. High MYC protein expression is found in 30% of newly diagnosed DLBCL patients and is also correlated to a dismal prognosis on R-CHOP therapy [13,17,18]. High MYC and BLC2 protein expression is correlated to a similar dismal prognosis in both ABC and GCB subtype DLBCL, suggesting that MYC and BCL2 protein co-expression represent a better predictor of prognosis than COO [19]. Recently, a meta-analysis of 24 eligible studies enrolling 4662 patients was published. For DLBCL patients with MYC rearrangements, the combined Hazard Ratio (HR) was 2.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.89–2.61) for OS and 2.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.81–2.90) for event-free survival (EFS), compared to patients without MYC rearrangements [4]. For patients with high MYC protein expression the HR were 2.13 (1.55–2.91) for OS and 2.21 (1.36–3.61) for EFS, clearly indicating that both MYC FISH rearrangement as well as high MYC protein expression are both correlated to a dismal prognosis on R-CHOP therapy [4]. First line intensified treatment (including up-front autologous stem cell transplantation), seems to prolong EFS, but relapses do often occur and improved OS has not been achieved [20,21].  "
485,S1092-9134(09)00032-X,Mantle cell lymphoma as a rare cause of intussusception: a report of 2 cases," 2 Case descriptions  2.1 Case 1 A 38-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of enlarging bilateral neck masses, weight loss, fatigue, and several weeks of drenching night sweats. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed diffuse lymphadenopathy. An inguinal lymph node biopsy was carried out at an outside institution, and a diagnosis of MCL was made on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. The diagnosis was confirmed by a fine needle aspiration biopsy that included surface marker analysis by laser scanning cytometry. The cells showed bright expression of surface ? light chain, CD20 and FMC7, and coexpressed CD19 and CD5. They were negative for CD23 and CD10. An identical immunophenotype was shown by flow cytometry analysis of a bone marrow aspiration biopsy. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis carried out on isolated cells showed a signal pattern consistent with a t(11;14)(q13;q32) (Fig. 1 ). Combination chemotherapy was begun with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). During the second course of the treatment cycle, the patient presented to the emergency department with severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain. No evidence of obstruction or perforation was found, and the pain resolved spontaneously. During the third cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed a recurrence of the right lower quadrant pain, this time of intermittent, cramping quality and variable intensity. A planned restaging CT scan carried out after the third chemotherapy cycle showed a long segment of ileocolic intussusception with a 2.0-cm pathologic lead point. The lead point was interpreted to be consistent with a lipoma. The intussusception did not resolve spontaneously, and the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy.   2.2 Case 2 A 71-year-old woman presented with masses in the right breast and right postauricular soft tissue. Six years earlier, she had been diagnosed with stage IV follicular lymphoma, for which she underwent treatment with 8 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy, with a good response. Three years before presentation, she developed a left postauricular soft tissue recurrence that was treated by radiotherapy alone. Her current disease proved to be unresponsive to treatment with rituximab, and therefore, reevaluation of the disease process was initiated. Fine needle aspiration of the breast mass revealed a monotonous population of intermediate-sized lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear contours. Flow cytometry analysis showed a monoclonal B-cell population with the marker profile surface immunoglobulin ?+, CD19+, CD20+, CD5+, FMC7+, CD10?, CD11c?, and CD23?. Immunoperoxidase analysis carried out on a glass slide showed positive nuclear staining of the tumor cells for cyclin D1. These findings were considered to be consistent with MCL. One month after presentation, the patient developed abdominal pain, vomiting, and rectal bleeding. A CT scan showed an ileocolic intussusception with a 5.2 × 4.8-cm lead point. The radiographic appearance was interpreted to be consistent with either a leiomyoma or lymphoma. Colonoscopic examination revealed a large mass in the cecum, which was considered to be highly suspicious for a carcinoma, and smaller, raised, smooth-surfaced lesions in the transverse colon, at the splenic flexure, and in the sigmoid colon. All of these lesions underwent biopsy, and all showed MCL. The intussusception failed to resolve spontaneously, and the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy.  "
487,S2213-0071(15)30054-X,A case of primary pulmonary NK/T cell lymphoma presenting as pneumonia," 2 Case report A 46-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with chief complaints of 10 days history of intermittent febrile sense and cough. He had scanty sputum. On review of the system, he denied weight loss and night sweat. He had no past medical history, but had a 20-pack-year smoking history, however he had stopped smoking five years ago. On admission, his vital signs included blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, pulse rate 74 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and body temperature 38.6 °C. On physical examination, his face had an acutely ill-looking appearance. No palpable lymph nodes were detected on the neck and supraclavicular area. Also, no throat injection and no specific lesion were detected on oropharyngeal cavity. On chest auscultation, crackles without wheezing were detected on the left lower lung (LLL) field, but paranasal sinus Water's view was no active lesion. Laboratory findings showed white blood cell count 5600/mm3, hemoglobin 13.0 g/dl, platelet count 206,000/mm3, aspartate aminotransferase 167 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 176 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, and CRP 1.66 mg/dL. Chest radiography showed LLL consolidation, particularly retrocardiac space (Fig. 1 ). He was initially treated with ceftriaxone (1 g bid intravenously), but, despite receiving empirical antibiotic treatment, he showed persistent cough and febrile senseduring one-week treatment. The attending physician considered pneumonia treatment failure, thus antibiotics were changed to piperacillin/tazobactam (4.5 g tid) and levofloxacin (500 mg qd) intravenously with no further studies for one week. Despite change in antibiotic treatment, he showed aggravated dyspnea. Laboratory findings at that time showed white blood cell counts 2900/mm3, hemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, platelet count 146,000/mm3, aspartate aminotransferase 211 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 118 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, total protein 3.0 g/dL, albumin 1.9 g/dL, and serum LDH 1050 IU/L. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air showed pH of 7.471, PCO2 of 29.1 mmHg, PO2 of 59.7 mmHg,       HCO  3   ?    of 20.7 mmol/L, and SaO2 of 92.8%. He underwent chest computed tomography (CT), which showed consolidation at LLL and dominant left pleural effusion (Fig. 2 ). Sputum studies revealed three consecutive negative results for acid-fast staining and non-specific cytology. Results of pleural fluid analysis showed a slightly red color, specific gravity 1.010, pH 7.5, no white blood cells were found, red blood cell count 2650/mm3, pleural total protein 2.5 g/dL, LDH level 1900 IU/L, and adenosine deaminase 80.2 U/L. For proper diagnosis, he was referred to a pulmonologist and bronchoscopic examination was performed. Bronchoscopic findings showed reddish mucosal nodular lesions with edematous mucosa on superior segmental bronchus of the left lower lobe (Fig. 3 ). On microscopic findings, the mucosa showed infiltration of medium-sized cells with irregular nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, and many apoptotic bodies. Angiocentric growth pattern and coagulative necrosis were also observed (Fig. 4 A). On immunohistochemical staining, the atypical cells were positive for CD3, CD30, CD56, MUM-1, and granzyme B but negative for cytokeratin, CD10, CD20, bcl-2, bcl-6, and ALK (Fig. 4B–D). In in situ hybridization for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) encoded RNA (EBER), most atypical cells were labeled (Fig. 4E). These findings were consistent with NK/T cell lymphoma. There was no evidence of lymphoma involvement in the extrapulmonary site, thus, he was diagnosed as primary pulmonary extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma. He showed rapid deterioration and was transferred to another hospital after final diagnosis. Unfortunately, he died shortly thereafter. "
488,S2212-5558(15)00118-0,Primary Burkitt-like lymphoma of the orbit diagnosed using ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy: A case study," 2 Case report A 73-year-old Caucasian female with medical history of hypertension, epilepsy and peripheral neuropathy was admitted to the Emergency Department at University College Hospital, London, with orbital pain, deterioration of vision, nausea and vomiting. General examination of the head and neck revealed right proptosis, reduced visual acuity and impaired visual fields. There were no other focal neurological signs. Observation of the patient's vital signs revealed elevated blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates with 99% oxygen saturation on air. The patient remained apyrexic with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15/15. Haematological investigations revealed increase in inflammatory markers, while biochemical investigations were within normal range. Virology screening was negative. A CT (computed tomography) of the head and neck was sought almost immediately and confirmed the presence of a right retro-bulbar mass (Fig. 1A). The initial working diagnosis included lymphoma, tumour metastasis, optic nerve glioma and meningioma. To confirm the diagnosis, an ultrasound-guided 16-gauge core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed under general anaesthesia using a lateral orbital approach (Fig. 1B and C). The procedure was carried out by an experienced head and neck radiologist and two tissue samples, each measuring 3mm in diameter, were obtained. The procedure was uncomplicated. Results from histological, immunohistochemical and genetic analyses of the two specimens are given in Table 1 . Immunohistochemistry images are shown in Fig. 2 . Despite ambiguity of immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic results, the patient was treated for Burkitt's lymphoma with the R-CODOX-M regimen (Rituximab, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Cytarabine, Doxorubicin and Methotrexate). The treatment was well tolerated by the patient and the initial results showed satisfactory resolution of the retro-bulbar mass and dissipation of marrow infiltrate. After two rounds of treatment, the patient developed a chemotherapy-induced encephalopathy and she was immediately placed on a less intensive regimen (R-CHOP with intrathecal cytarabine) of which she received 3 courses. The patient remained symptom-free for 8 months. "

His PET scan showed the lymphoma was confined to the prostate and bladder. He was subsequently treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP and achieved a complete response. Two years post treatment he presented with pancytopenia and splenomegaly and was found to have disease relapse on bone marrow biopsy. There was extensive bone marrow involvement showing collections of intermediate to large lymphocytes within dilated sinusoids. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the collections to be CD20+ with Ki67 index 50–60%. Flow cytometry showed a monoclonal population of large B-cells with CD5+, CD10– phenotype, which is often associated with a higher prevalence of marrow involvement and lower frequency of neurological abnormalities."
491,S1572-1000(09)00166-5,Lacrimal gland mantle lymphoma treated with photodynamic therapy: Overview and report of a case," Case report A 59-year-old Caucasian female attended the UCLH Head and Neck Centre with nine years history of quiescent lacrimal gland MCL that has been progressively increasing in size over the previous few months; this had caused reduction in the visual acuity, diplopia, proptosis and limitation/restriction of extraocular movements; as well as causing facial disfigurement. The tumour was initially diagnosed as a primary orbital lymphoma of the lacrimal glands; then this was discussed at a specialized multidisciplinary meeting. The patient opted for no treatment and declined all the options available as she felt that the potential adverse effects outweigh the benefits. Examination revealed right supraorbital swelling with multiple lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions. The tumour was staged as IIAE (using the Ann-Arbor staging system), referring to the involvement of more than one group within either the upper half or lower half of the body, with the absence of systemic symptoms and local extra-nodal involvement (lacrimal gland). On palpation, the tumour was firm, well circumscribed measuring approximately 2.5cm×3cm, 3cm×4cm and 4.5cm×5cm at the supraorbital, submandibular and axillary regions, respectively. Ultrasonic examination revealed a well-circumscribed, non-homogeneous hypoechoic area of the lacrimal gland as the main cause for visual problems. The patient signed an informed consent and agreed to have photodynamic therapy to the lacrimal gland and the cervical and axillary lymph nodes. mTHPC, with a dose of 0.15mg/kg, was used as the photosensitizing agent 4 days prior to tissue illumination with 652nm diode laser. Intra-operatively, spinal needles were fed into the tumour under US-guidance. Optical fibres were, then, inserted through the needles and allowed to protrude by 2–3mm to deliver maximum light therapy. As the diameter of necrosis post-PDT does not exceed 1cm, the needles were pulled back 1cm at a time to allow treatment of the thick tumour (i.e. in lymph nodes). The total energy delivered per port was 20J/cm2 (Figs. 1 and 2  ). The cold photochemical reaction results from interaction between the drug (mTHPC), oxygen in tumour tissue and the light from the diode laser. This reaction lasts for few hours and results in apoptosis or direct tumour cell death associated with vascular shut down. In the immediate post-PDT phase, light exposure was implemented at an incremental rate of 100lux/day. Pain control was mainly through standard analgesics (i.e. paracetamol and NSAIDs). At 3 months review, the patient reported resolution of all visual symptoms and softening of the treated areas. Further assessment took place at 6-month-follow-up revealed reduction in the size of the supraorbital swelling and the treated cervical and axillary lymph nodes (Figs. 3 and 4  ). To date (14 months post-PDT), there has been no increase in the size of the tumour areas and the patient is still considering the offer of another round of PDT. "

496,S2468-6441(18)30001-X,Pericardial Involvement with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma: A Rare Case of Constrictive Pericarditis," Case Presentation A 57-year-old man presented to an outside hospital with a 2-month history of intermittent fevers, night sweats, and chest pain with radiation to the back that was worsened by lying supine and deep breathing. History was notable for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with frequent oral steroid use. One month prior, his family physician prescribed levofloxacin 500 mg/d and oral prednisone 20 mg/d for similar symptoms. Other regular medications included inhaled albuterol 90 ?g as needed, fluticasone 50 ?g nasal spray daily, aspirin 81 mg/d, and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/d. On physical examination, there was no evidence of volume overload, and heart sounds were normal with no pericardial friction rub. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The patient's laboratory investigations were significant for a leukocytosis of 28 × 103 cells/?L, with an elevated absolute lymphocyte count of 14 × 103/?L. On review of his prior blood work, his leukocyte count was noted to be intermittently elevated over 5 years preceding presentation but had been thought to be secondary to intermittent steroid use for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. The platelet count was 242 × 109/L, and hemoglobin was 12.1 g/dL, with normocytic normochromic red cell indices. Troponin was undetectable, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was within normal limits. Electrocardiography revealed tachycardia with no ST-segment changes. A computed tomographic imaging study of the chest was done to assess for pulmonary embolism. This study was negative for pulmonary embolism but revealed thickening of the pericardium (with a small pericardial effusion) and multiple anterior mediastinal and precarinal lymph nodes, all <8 mm in size (Figures 1 A–1C). The patient was started on aspirin 325 mg three times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for possible acute pericarditis. Within 1 week, the patient presented to our institution with ongoing symptoms of pain and shortness of breath despite aspirin and colchicine use. Echocardiography showed evidence of a thickened pericardium and signs of pericardial constrictive physiology. Two-dimensional imaging revealed a diastolic septal bounce and respirophasic variation of the interventricular septum (Videos 1 and 2). Continuous-wave Doppler across the mitral and tricuspid valves revealed an early-to-late diastolic mitral inflow (E/A) ratio of 1.8, a short deceleration time of 96 msec, and significant flow variation across the mitral (41%) and tricuspid (97%) valves with respiration (Figures 2 A and 2B). There was also annulus reversus with a septal mitral annular tissue velocity of 13 cm/sec compared with 10 cm/sec of the lateral mitral annulus (Figures 2C and 2D) and prominent expiratory diastolic flow reversal on continuous-wave Doppler of the hepatic veins (Figure 2E). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal septal motion and pericardial tethering, especially along the basal to mid right ventricular free wall (Video 3). Prominent respirophasic septal shift of the interventricular septum was seen (Video 4). Late gadolinium enhancement showed mild delayed pericardial enhancement adjacent to the right ventricular free wall and anteriorly (Figure 3 ). Overall findings were consistent with constrictive pericarditis with mild active inflammation. Given the patient's unexplained elevated leukocyte count, peripheral blood flow cytometry was done. This revealed B cells that displayed an abnormal immunophenotype diagnostic of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder consistent with CLL/SLL with an unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain gene status. The patient continued to have symptoms despite the aspirin and colchicine. Prednisone 20 mg/d and azathioprine 100 mg/ were added with little benefit. Given the lack of response to immunosuppressive therapy, the patient was referred for radical pericardiectomy 3 months following his initial presentation. The patient did well following radical pericardiectomy with improved breathing and exercise tolerance. The pathology lab received multiple segments of tissue measuring in aggregate 20.5 × 14.9 × 5.0 cm. The outer surface demonstrated adipose tissue and hemorrhage. The inner surface was smooth with areas of minute hemorrhage. The wall ranged in thickness from 0.1-0.8 cm. Sectioning revealed a fibrotic and calcified cut surface. No areas of nodularity or necrosis were identified. The gross characteristics of the specimen did not differ from the typical pericardial appearance of chronic constrictive pericarditis. Final histopathology revealed chronic pericarditis with fibrosis and involvement by B-cell CLL/SLL (Figure 4 ). Adjacent lymph nodes and adipose tissue also demonstrated involvement with B-cell CLL/SLL. breathing and exercise tolerance. Final pathology revealed chronic pericarditis with fibrosis and involvement by B-cell SLL/CLL (Figure 4). Adjacent lymph nodes and adipose tissue also demonstrated involvement with B-cell CLL/SLL. Chemotherapy was discussed with bendamustine and rituximab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, or ibrutinib, which the patient initially declined before subsequently agreeing to start bendamustine and rituximab therapy. He remains free of symptoms now >1 year postoperatively. "
497,S0145-2126(12)00349-9,Infectious diseases and risk of leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: A case-control study," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study subjects A population based case-control study was carried out in Savona Province (Northern Italy), with the main purpose of estimating the risk of leukemia and NHL in a population environmentally and occupationally exposed to potentially carcinogenic compounds. Results from the analysis of the main end-points will be published elsewhere, while the present paper is focused on the association between the risk of both malignancies and previous exposure to infectious agents. Both cases and controls were selected among the residents in Savona Province, which included 210,294 inhabitants at the 2001 Italian National census (data available at: http://www.regione.liguria.it/statist/censimenti/popolazione/2001/classe_eta.xls). Leukemia incidence cases were identified through Liguria Region hospital medical records among those subjects with a new diagnosis of leukemia between 2002 and 2005, based on the ICD9 code 204.0–208.9. Furthermore, malignancies of the hematopoietic system of uncertain behavior (ICD9 code 238.4 and 238.7) were also included in the study. Cases with a diagnosis of NHL between 2003 and 2005 were identified from the same source on the basis of the ICD9 codes (200.0–200.9 and 202.0–202.9). For the purposes of this article, clinical documentation of each interviewed case was revised according to the WHO classification [13] by a trained epidemiologist of Liguria Cancer Registry. To be eligible for this study cases had to be aged 20 years or more at the time of diagnosis and resident for at least five years in the same district of Savona Province. Controls were selected by a random sampling from the population health registry, adopting a frequency matching by sex and age (±5 years) with an approximately 1:1 sampling ratio. The same eligibility criteria used for cases selection were adopted for the controls, who had also to be unaffected by leukemia or lymphoma at the time of recruitment (April 15, 2004).   2.2 Interview and questionnaire Both cases and controls were firstly contacted by mail, in order to illustrate the aim of the study, and further asked by telephone to make an appointment with an interviewer. Family doctors were asked to contact those subjects whose telephone number was not traced. Interviews were made by trained personnel using the same procedure for cases and controls and took place between April 2005 and February 2009. Interviewers were not aware of the case-control status. In order to reduce the risk of recall bias, in the present investigation data from interviews addressed to relatives (31%) were excluded from the analyses, because most infections were likely to have occurred during childhood. Interviews were made either face-to-face (68%) or by telephone (32%), lasted on average about 80min and were preferably made at home (48%) or arranged in an office of the Savona Local Health Centre 2 (48%). Only 3 persons were interviewed during their hospitalization. Detailed information on residential history, educational level, lifestyle habit (tobacco and alcohol consumption, hair dye use, and leisure activities), drug use, occupational exposures, previous diseases, diagnostic and therapeutic radiations, and family medical history were obtained by a structured questionnaire. The following communicable diseases were considered: typical infections during childhood (measles, rubella, chickenpox, mumps, pertussis, and scarlet fever), typhus and paratyphus, herpes zoster, herpes simplex (both labialis and genitalis), tuberculosis, malaria, infectious mononucleosis, and other diseases specified by the subject. The age at the onset of each disease was also recorded and any infection occurred within five years before the inclusion into the study was excluded from the analyses.   2.3 Statistical analysis Mean and standard deviations (SD) were used to describe continuous variables, while frequencies were employed for qualitative ones. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression [14] was applied to estimate the association between each considered malignancy and the previous onset of infectious diseases, using the whole group of controls for both comparisons. Odds ratios (ORs) and their related 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by adjusting for the following putative confounders: gender, age, smoking habit, educational level, exposure to radiation, pesticides or aromatic hydrocarbons. In more details, age was included into the model as a continuous variable, using both a linear and a quadratic term, while education was categorized into three levels (low: illiterate or primary school; intermediate: middle school; high: high school or university degree). Binary indicators were used to describe the exposure to tobacco smoking (ever vs. never smokers) and to pesticides, hydrocarbons and radiations (present vs. absent). Professional exposure to pesticides or hydrocarbons was assessed using the ISTAT-ATECO codes [15] and a subject was considered as exposed if he/she performed a job in an exposed category for at least five years during his/her life. Finally, radiations exposure included professional, therapeutic and diagnostic ones and, among these latter, only heavy radiations were taken into consideration (computerized axial tomography, scintigraphy and radioscopy). Childhood diseases were analyzed separately and also grouped together using a binary variable to indicate the presence or the absence of at least one disease. The lifetime number of infections was also investigated. Finally, the place of residence during childhood, which could have been associated with a different incidence of infections, was also considered, analyzing the following variables: geographic area (Northern, Central and Southern Italy, and foreign countries), urbanization degree (rural, semi-rural, semi-urban and urban), according to the Italian Central Statistical Institute classification system [16], and having lived in a rural house or farm. Because most rural areas were located in Southern Italy, all these variables were included in the regression models. Statistical analyses were performed by the package Stata (version 11.1, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  "
501,S1755-0017(09)00093-1,Diffuse pulmonary infiltration by anaplastic lymphoma kinase negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma: A case report and literature review," 2 Discussion ALCL is CD30+T-cell or null-cell NHL, which consists of primary (systemic and cutaneous ALCLs) and secondary (anaplastic transformation from another lymphoma) forms. The primary systemic ALCL accounts for 10–15% of NHL cases in children and adolescents, whereas only 3% in adults. 1  ALCL is found to be associated with the t(2;5) translocation, which results in the expression of ALK protein. 2  50–60% of primary systemic ALCLs express ALK protein. ALCL occurs preferentially in the sinusoids of lymph nodes, but can also be found in extranodal sites. In a large study, lung involvement happened in only 11% of ALCL. 3  The extranodal involvement in ALK-negative ALCL is even rare. With regards to pulmonary involvement of ALCL, two patterns, the primary (very rare) and secondary pulmonary ALCL have been described. Primary pulmonary ALCL is defined as clonal lymphoid proliferation affecting one or both lungs (parenchyma and/or bronchi) in a patient with no detectable extrapulmonary involvement at diagnosis or during the subsequent 3 months. 4  More often than not, lung is a site of secondary involvement in systemic ALCL. In some cases, the primary or secondary pulmonary ALCL is almost indistinguishable in view of the potential involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes. To the best of our knowledge, only 22 cases of primary pulmonary ALCL have been reported, including 4 children and 18 adults without prominent gender preponderance. 4–9  Radiographic features include endobronchial or intracheal mass (9/22), nodules or mass (3/22), pleural effusion (3/22), consolidation (1/22), cavitations (1/22) and cystic lesions (1/22). (Detailed description of chest radiography in 7 cases is unavailable.) Among 8 cases that had ALK staining, 3 cases are ALK-negative ALCL. There are few radiographic studies on secondary pulmonary ALCL. Case series about diffuse lung involvement of systemic ALCL were reported. Close reported a case with ALCL pulmonary involvement mimicking miliary tuberculosis. 10  Postmortem examination revealed extensive involvement of the heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, bone marrow and lymph nodes. 15 cases of ALCL with leukemic phase were reported by now and among them, 9 cases have diffuse lung involvement and 4 cases have pleural effusion. 11,12  In two pediatric ALCL cases, diffuse lung infiltrates, mediastinal adenopathy and hemophagocytosis were presented. 13  The outcomes of all these cases were poor. A large study has concluded that ALK-positive ALCL had a far better 5-year overall survival rate (70%) than that of ALK-negative one (49%), ALK is therefore regarded as an important prognostic indicator. 14  Interestingly, all the above reports with diffuse lung involvement are ALK-positive, indicating that diffuse lung infiltration is also one of unfavorable prognostic factors. In summary, we present a rare case of ALK-negative ALCL with fever, diffuse pulmonary nodules and rapid progression to respiratory failure. Timely biopsy is crucial for diagnosis and appropriate management. Although the patient might respond to chemotherapy at some point, in general, diffuse pulmonary involvement heralded unfavorable outcome. "
504,S2152-2650(11)70091-X,Lymphoma and Immunosuppression: A Report of a Case Associated With Efalizumab Therapy," Case Report A 55-year-old black male on weekly efalizumab therapy for 2 years to treat generalized psoriasis presented with a 4-week history of fatigue, back pain, and weight loss of 11 kg. There was no history of fever, night sweats, headache, or seizures. His past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and psoriasis. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, metformin, and pioglitazone. His physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a mild anemia with hematocrit of 27% (normal, 41%-53%), white blood cell count of 3.80 × 103/?L (normal, 4-11 × 103/?L) and normal platelet count. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 1292 U/L (normal, 100-190 U/L) and other serum chemistries were unremarkable. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse abnormal bone density suggestive of malignancy. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed scattered lucencies within the thoracic vertebrae, ribs, and sternum along with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and slight splenomegaly. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT confirmed extensive hypermetabolic activity throughout the bony skeleton. A bone marrow biopsy showed 95% necrotic tumor and numerous crushed CD20 and CD45-positive B cells on immunoperoxidase stains consistent with a B-cell lymphoma. Efalizumab was discontinued and the LDH levels decreased to 203 U/L over a 3-week period. A repeat bone marrow biopsy revealed that the necrosis had reduced by 50% with only 1% viable monoclonal B cells. A third marrow biopsy was performed 2 weeks later when the patient's hematocrit had increased to 31% and white blood cell count had normalized. This biopsy revealed a diffuse infiltrate of medium to large immature cells with no residual tumor necrosis. Immunoperoxidase staining of these cells exhibited CD20 and weak CD10 positivity with about 50% Ki-67 (MIB-1) positivity, findings consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Flow cytometry on the aspirate was negative for monoclonal B cells. Cells were negative for Epstein Barr virus (EBV)–encoded RNA-1 (EBER). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was negative for t(8;14), t(11;14), and t(14;18), and cytogenetics were normal with G banding using trypsin and giemsa. His LDH level began to increase with persistent disease on PET scan and treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) was initiated. After 6 cycles of R-CHOP, repeat bone marrow biopsy showed no residual lymphoma with negative staining for CD79a and CD20. Flow cytometry confirmed no evidence of a hematolymphoid malignancy. Three months after treatment, PET scan had normalized consistent with a complete remission. "
510,S2213-0489(15)30020-0,Four hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma cases of Japanese patients," 2 Case presentation The clinical and laboratory features of these 4 cases are summarized in  Table 1 (cases 1–4). None of the patients had previous illness that was related to immunodeficiency, immunosuppression or an abnormal immunological status. All of the patients had B symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenias at diagnosis, resulting in a high or high-intermediate International Prognostic Index (IPI). Case 1 was a 74-year-old female. A liver biopsy demonstrated the infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphoma cells in the sinusoids and portal area, and these cells were CD3(+), CD4(?), CD5(?), CD8(?), CD56(+), TIA-1(+), granzyme B(?) and Epstein–Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization(?) ( Fig. 1). The patient had a CR by treatment with 6 cycles of CHOP, and has remained alive for more than 12 months after achieving a CR. Case 2 was a 64-year-old male. A liver biopsy demonstrated the infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphoma cells in the sinusoids and portal area, and these cells were CD3(+), CD4(?), CD5(?), CD8(+), CD56(+), TIA-1(+), granzyme B(+) and EBER(?). He was treated with 6 cycles of THP-COP (pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) to achieve a PR for 10 months. Combination chemotherapy with 2 cycles of CHASE (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, etoposide and dexamethasone) was administered after the disease progression, however, the tumor cells infiltrated the central nervous system. He ultimately died 37 months after the diagnosis. Case 3 was a 59-year-old male. A bone marrow clot demonstrated hypercellular bone marrow with medium- to large-sized lymphoma cells that were CD3(+), CD4(?), CD5(?), CD8(?) and EBER(?). He was initially treated with 2 cycles of CHOP followed by 2 cycles of ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone and cytarabine), resulting in a PR. An autologous stem cell transplantation preceded by a preparative regimen MCEC (ranimustine, carboplatin, etoposide and cytarabine) provided a CR. He relapsed 3 months post-transplant and died 11 months after the diagnosis. Case 4 was a 23-year-old male. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hypercellular bone marrow with medium- to large-sized lymphoma cells that were CD3(+), CD4(?), CD5(?), CD8(?), CD56(?), TIA-1(+), granzyme B(?) and EBER(?), as previously reported [5]. He was treated with 1 cycle of CHOP followed by 3 cycles of IVAC (ifosfamide, etoposide and cytarabine), resulting in a PR. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an unrelated donor preceded by a preparative regimen composed of etoposide, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation provided a CR. He relapsed 3 months post-transplant and died 19 months after the diagnosis. "

He had been treated for premature ventricular contraction. Serological test results showed mild increased EBV capsid antigen and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibody titer. Tests for HIV, HBV, and HCV were negative. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) revealed pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 1A). Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion (800mL) was removed by pericardiocentesis, and 700mL of pericardial fluid was removed over 3 days via the indwelling drain. Pleural effusion disappeared without treatment after the drainage of pericardial effusion. There was no evidence of lymphoma involvement in the lymph nodes or bone marrow. The disease phenotype and infection mechanism were immunohistochemically investigated by the cellblock prepared from 800mL of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. Because pericardial effusion collection had not recurred after one instance of pericardiocentesis, the patient was observed for the condition after pericardiocentesis. Bilateral fluid in the thoracic cavity also disappeared. He has shown good improvement in condition for 24 months without chemotherapy (Fig. 1B). "

At the same time, he showed weight loss of 5kg and a fever of 38–39°C. At a clinic visit at our hospital, the size of the tumor was 1cm. His tumor grew rapidly over the next 2 months, and on admission, the tumor measured 10cm×7cm in diameter and was ulcerated (Fig. 1 ). There was neither lymphadenopathy nor organomegaly. Laboratory examination showed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.9g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 119,000/?L, and elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (202IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (266IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (701IU/L), ferritin (5350ng/mL), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (3730U/mL). Serological tests for virus infection including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, were negative. Whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed a FDG-avid cutaneous lesion in the right axilla. Bone marrow examination revealed CD68-positive macrophages distributed diffusely throughout the bone marrow. Erythrocytes and platelets were noted within the cytoplasm of the macrophages (Fig. 2 ). Skin biopsy demonstrated non-epidermotropic infiltrates with cohesive sheets of large tumor cells (Fig. 3A). The tumor cells were large, multinucleated, pleomorphic, anaplastic cells with large, round, irregularly shaped nuclei and abundant chromatin. They showed high mitotic activity (Fig. 3B). Upon immunohistochemical staining, the proliferating cells were phenotypically characterized to be CD4?, CD8+, CD30+ (Fig. 3C), CD56?, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK?) (Fig. 3D), TIA-1+ (Fig. 3E), and granzyme B+ (Fig. 3F). Flow cytometric analysis of the cells in the skin biopsy specimen revealed that the major cell population was CD2+, CD3?, CD4?, CD5?, CD8+, CD20?, CD25+, CD56?, and CD30+. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having C-ALCL. The patient was found to have stage IEA disease and low risk according to the international prognostic index. The patient was treated with irradiation (total 46Gy). He achieved a complete response (CR) and has been disease-free for 5 months. "

526,S2213-5766(17)30361-5,Appendiceal and ovarian Burkitt's lymphoma presenting as acute appendicitis," 2 Case report The patient is a 13 year old girl that presented to the emergency department with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The patient was well until the day before when she developed abdominal pain and subjective fever. The pain was constant, non-radiating, and worsened with walking. The pain was associated with nausea and non-bilious emesis without diarrhea or constipation. On presentation, she was afebrile with mild tachypnea; all other vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed an alert patient with a soft and non-distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness to palpation, particularly localized to right lower quadrant. Laboratory results revealed a leukocytosis to 15.1 × 103/mcL with 93% neutrophils and elevated C-Reactive Protein to 2.0 mg/dL. All other laboratory values were within normal limits. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound showed findings consistent with acute appendicitis and a non-visualized left ovary with a complex left adnexal mass measuring 8.0 × 6.0 × 7.0 cm and small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. A CT scan was subsequently performed which demonstrated a 6.8 × 2.4 × 2.7 cm tubular, dilated, fluid-filled, blind ending structure arising from the cecum with surrounding inflammatory changes indicative of appendicitis as well as a solid and cystic indeterminate left ovarian mass (Fig. 1 A and B). Given the CT findings, tumor markers were sent and the patient was initially treated with IV antibiotics. Normal AFP and quantitative ?hCG levels were obtained, and the patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy and ovarian sparing surgery with possible oophorectomy. Operative findings revealed a distended, thickened appendix with adhesions to the omentum and an enlarged left ovary with no cyst wall capsule (Fig. 2 A and B). Due to the normal ovarian tumor markers and finding of what was thought to be fat on the ultrasound of the ovarian mass, the initial suspicion was for a dermoid cyst that could be resected in an ovarian sparing fashion. However, since no cyst was identified, an intra-operative biopsy of the ovary was submitted to pathology for frozen section. This revealed a small round blue cell tumor. Thus, a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed to obtain adequate tissue for pathology and to prevent any spillage of tumor following the family's consent. The macroscopic pathology exhibited an enlarged, dilated appendix measuring 13.8 cm in length and ranging in diameter from 0.8 cm at the appendiceal base to 3.7 cm at the appendiceal tip. The dilated portion was completely replaced by a pale pink and glistening fleshy cut surface. Evaluation of the left fallopian tube and ovary revealed the fimbriated end of the tube to be unremarkable with an adjacent 0.6 cm paratubal cyst. The enlarged ovary measured 6.9 × 5.8 × 4.7 cm and was almost entirely replaced by a pale pink-gray fleshy cut surface with focal areas of congestion (Fig. 3 A and B). Microscopic examination of the specimens supported a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma involving the entire appendiceal circumference and ovary as well as the fallopian tube. Tumor cells were positive for CD20 (a B-cell marker which is positive for the neoplastic cells), CD10, BCL-2 (is typically negative in Burkitts lymphoma but positive in this case indicating the presence of an additional BCL2 breakpoint consistent with a high-grade B-cell lymphoma), c-Myc (indicates a high grade B cell lymphoma), BCL-6 (germinal center marker positive in Burkitt lymphoma) and PAX-5 with a Ki-67 proliferation index of virtually 100% (indicating a high proliferation index which is typical for Burkitt lymphoma) (Fig. 4 ). Karyotyping from the ovarian mass was normal for t(8; 14). After the pathology was finalized, the patient underwent port placement with bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and lumbar puncture. Bone marrow aspirates and core biopsies were negative for malignancy. A subsequent PET/CT of the abdomen revealed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy at the periaortic, iliac, and pelvic regions as well as a right side pelvic mass along the pelvic wall. Staging for her B-cell lymphoma was at low risk group B which is equivalent to stage III. The patient is being treated with chemotherapy, using Children's Oncology Group Study - ANHL1131 standard arm comprised of the COPADM regimen (Cyclophosphamide, Oncovin, Prednisolone, Adriamycin, and Methotrexate without Rituximab).

543,S0046-8177(09)00111-7,Primary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the gallbladder: report of a case harboring API2/MALT1 gene fusion," 2 Case report A 75-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with a few days' history of right upper abdominal pain and fever. Physical examination revealed pronounced tenderness over the right hypochondrium. No lymphadenopathy was noted. Routine laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count but increased neutrophilia and an inflammatory syndrome. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated thickening of the gallbladder wall and several stones. Escherichia coli was detected in blood cultures. Antimicrobial therapy was administered, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on the next day after the admission. The resected gallbladder, received open, measured 6.5 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter and contained no visible gallstones. Grossly (Fig. 1A), the bottom and the distal portion of the wall were circumferentially thickened (up to 1 cm) and firm over more than 4 cm. The overlying mucosa had a trabeculated and granular appearance, and the serosa was congestive. The cystic duct had a normal diameter and contained no stone. No cystic lymph node was identified. Histologic examination (Fig. 1B-E) revealed a diffuse and vaguely nodular dense lymphoid infiltrate, extending from the mucosa down to the serosa and surrounding reactive lymphoid follicles. Mucosal folds were preserved although widened and shortened. The infiltrate comprised mainly small monotonous-looking lymphoid cells, harboring slightly irregular nuclei with mottled chromatin and surrounded by a moderately abundant clear cytoplasm. Scattered blasts were identified. There was no obvious plasmacytic differentiation. Some of the rarefied epithelial crypts exhibited lymphoepithelial lesions. The gallbladder wall adjacent to the tumor showed features of slight chronic cholecystitis. Special stains failed to reveal any microorganism. The resection margin at the cystic canal was free of lymphomatous infiltration. By immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2A-F), the lymphoid infiltrate was diffusely positive for CD20, with monotypic IgM ? staining. The lymphoma cells were negative for IgD, CD5, CD43, CD10, and BCL6, and positive for BCL2. CD21 immunostaining disclosed remnants of follicular dendritic cell networks, associated with reactive follicles. Ki-67 was expressed in less than 5% of lymphoid cells outside the germinal centers. The presence of lymphoepithelial lesions in the epithelium was highlighted by cytokeratin staining. Some small dispersed T lymphocytes were positive for CD3, CD5, and CD43. Immunostaining for BCL10 produced a moderate nuclear staining in most lymphoma cells. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis performed on paraffin sections with MALT1 split signal DNA probe (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) demonstrated 39% of isolated signals, consistent with MALT1 gene rearrangement (cutoff, 10%). IGH/MALT1 fusion probe (Fig. 2G) confirmed MALT1 gene rearrangement, showing 3 isolated orange signals in more than 50% of nuclei examined; however, IGH gene was not rearranged (2 green signals per nucleus), and there was no evidence of IGH/MALT1 fusion signals. Finally, a t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation was demonstrated with the API2/MALT1 fusion probe (Fig. 2H), which showed 2 fusion signals in more than 50% of the nuclei. The staging procedure comprised upper and lower digestive tract endoscopy with biopsies (from gastric corpus, gastric antrum, duodenum, ileum, and colon), upper airways examination, chest and abdomen computed tomography scans, positron emission tomography scan, and bone marrow biopsy. A small focus of lymphoid infiltrate was found in the duodenal mucosa, composed of CD20-positive small B cells, with nuclear positivity for BCL10 and ? light chain restriction. A seminested polymerase chain reaction–based assay [14] showed the same monoclonal rearrangement of the IGH locus in the gallbladder and in the duodenum. Biopsies from all other gastrointestinal sites were devoid of any suspicious lymphoid infiltrate. The bone marrow biopsy and aspirate showed no evidence of lymphoma. Hence, we considered the small duodenal infiltrate as reflecting minimal lymphoma extension in the proximity of the primary tumor site and appraised this gallbladder lymphoma as a stage IE disease. The patient was treated intermittently with chlorambucil and is free of recurrence 16 months after diagnosis. "
544,S2352-5126(18)30134-6,"Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, presenting with generalized ulcerated plaques and hypereosinophilia"," Case report A woman in her 50s with no significant medical history presented with a 6-month history of an itchy rash and gradually enlarging sores of her scalp, trunk, and extremities. She was treated for contact dermatitis with prednisone and topical steroids without resolution. She denied weight loss, night sweats, or fevers. She reported a 25-year history of occupational exposure to ammonium nitrate fertilizer and recounted being detained at airport security because of detection on her skin. Examination revealed the skin findings described in Fig 1  and a pink plaque of the bulbar conjunctiva of the left eye. Initial laboratory values, of blood drawn while on prednisone, showed a white blood cell count of 9,700 cells/?L with 17% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 1,649 cells/?L), which increased to 39,000 cells/?L with 56% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 21,840 cells/?L) off of prednisone. Flow cytometry on peripheral blood found no evidence of an aberrant myeloid or lymphoid population, but a clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was detected. Serum lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 308. A computed tomography scan of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis found a 3-cm nodular consolidation in the left lower lobe of the lung (Fig 1). There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy found hypocellular marrow (20%) with trilineage hematopoiesis and eosinophilia. Flow cytometry of marrow was negative for an aberrant lymphoid or myeloid population. A clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was detected, matching the clone identified in the peripheral blood. Several skin biopsies over the course of 4 months were reported as eosinophilic spongiosis, with negative direct immunofluorescence. Wound cultures grew abundant Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Biopsies of a plaque on the trunk and a scalp mass found an atypical T-cell infiltrate described in Fig 2 . Flow cytometry on the scalp mass (Fig 3 ) found an aberrant T-cell population with the following immunophenotype: CD2–, CD3+, CD4–, CD5–, CD7–, CD8–, CD16–, CD56–, CD10dim, and ?? T-cell receptor negative. Flow cytometry on a transbronchial lung biopsy found a matching aberrant T-cell population. An extensive workup for eosinophilia found normal B12, tryptase, IgA, IgE, IgM, and IgG subclasses. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. No FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion, PCM1-JAK2 fusion, PDGFRB rearrangement at 5q33.2, KIT Asp816Val mutation, or BCR/ABL translocation was detected. The patient's karyotype was normal. An infectious workup was negative for antibodies to HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus-1, Strongyloides, and Coccidioides. Histoplasma and Blastomyces antigens were not detected. The serum interleukin-5 level was 24 pg/mL (normal value is 5 pg/mL or less). PTCL-NOS was diagnosed, and, in coordination with the oncology department, the patient was given 400 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 25 mg/m2 doxorubicin, and 1 mg vincristine on day 1 and 40 mg/m2 prednisone on days 1 through 5 (mini-CHOP), followed by skin radiation. She improved, with resolution of her peripheral eosinophilia, decreased pruritus, and regression of some skin lesions. Unfortunately, she died of sepsis within 2 months of her diagnosis. "

One month ago, the patient presented paresthesias and numbness of the right lower extremity. This particularly involved the lower buttock, posterior thigh and the posterior calf and knee. He had increasing symptoms, with pain radiating from the posterior thigh to the foot. In the following days, he developed rapidly progressive right lower extremity weakness. He was then admitted to our hospital. Physical examination revealed marked swelling in his right posterior thigh. A lump can be touched without activity. On neurological examination, mental status and cranial nerves were normal. Upper extremity and left lower extremity strength was normal. Right lower extremity strength was markedly reduced. The patient has no any immunodeficiency disease. Electromyogram (EMG) was performed. The right thigh muscles examined showed a small quantity motor unit, ventricular fibrillation and positive sharp wave. Nerve conduction studies revealed reduction in amplitude of motor nerve action potential of the right common peroneal and sciatic nerve, slowed conduction velocity of the above two nerves and absent right tibial motor nerve. Reduced amplitude of right sensory nerve action potential and slowed conduction velocity were found existed in peroneal nerve. The right tibial sensory nerve was absent. All these findings indicated that the right lower extremity existed nerve origin impairment. Emission computed tomography (ECT) was conducted in the following day. After intravenous injection 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (99mTC-MDP), the whole body bone scanning showed increased radioactive uptake of the right lower extremity soft tissue. However, there were no abnormal radioactive uptakes such as collection, sparseness or defect in the other regions of the whole body. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed the olden calcification in the left upper lobe of the lung. There were no other positive findings in the lung field and the mediastinum. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormality in the liver, gall, pancreas, spleen and kidney. Bone marrow biopsy was also negative finding. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained with a 1.5T MR scanner (Sonata, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). A solitary fusiform lesion along the right sciatic nerve was revealed, from the inferior margion of the ectogluteus to popliteal area. The lesion showed hyperintense on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1 ) and isointense to muscles on T1-weighted images (Fig. 2 ). On the axial images, the lesion located among the biceps femoris, semimembranous and semitendinous. In the central of the lesion, sciatic nerve can be found. In addition, there were hyperintense in the muscles adjacent to the lesion on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images which indicated infiltration (Fig. 3 ). Enhanced T1-weighted images revealed a well-defined, strongly enhanced lesion with a small portion of necrosis (Figs. 4 and 5  ). The preoperative diagnosis was neurogenic tumor based on the MRI findings. Intraoperative gross examination found that the tumor diffusely expanded the sciatic nerve, and extending surrounding muscles. The tumor originated from the sciatic nerve and presented fish appearance. Nerve fibrous degeneration was found. The final histological examination showed small, round-cell tumor cells which extensively infiltrated in the endoneurium or perineurium of the nerve fibers (Figs. 6 and 7  ). In the immunohistochemical study, the neoplastic cells showed clear positivity with reagents raised to leukocyte common antigen, and the cells were positive with CD20, CD79a and CD10. The tumor cells showed increased Ki67 expression (Ki67>60%). Thus, the tumor was diagnosed as a diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. At last, the tumor was resected with the sciatic nerve and complementary chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and vincristine was then carried out. No radiation therapy was performed on the patient. "
556,S0046-8177(09)00208-1,Primary follicular lymphoma of the extrahepatic bile duct mimicking a hilar cholangiocarcinoma: case report and review of the literature," 2 Case presentation A 53-year-old Asian woman was referred to our department after a two week history of abdominal pain, bloating, and dysphagia. Ultrasound examination showed diffuse gallbladder thickening with echogenic streaks within the wall and markedly heterogeneous liver with a nodular dome suggestive of chronic liver disease. The bile duct wall was also thickened (3 mm) and had a diameter of 1 cm (mild dilation). Liver function tests revealed elevations of alkaline phosphatase (247 IU/L), alanine transferase (165 IU/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (48 IU/L), whereas bilirubin was in the reference range. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed that revealed a neoplasm measuring 6 × 8 cm at the porta hepatis extending to the right lobe of the liver, with infiltration into extrahepatic fat at the porta hepatis. The common hepatic duct (CHD) was obstructed causing mild to moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation and narrowing or occlusion of the right portal vein. No lymphadenopathy was seen and the liver did not have a cirrhotic appearance. The tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen, alphafetoprotein, CA-125, and CA 19-9 were normal. These findings were suggestive of an infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma, although hepatocellular carcinoma was also considered in the differential diagnosis. Based on the above, the patient was referred for an endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. The tumor was more clearly imaged at the region where it surrounded the CHD. A deeply hypoechoic thickening of the duct wall was identified, beginning 1 to 2 cm above the head of the pancreas and progressing into a 3- to 4-cm deeply hypoechoic mass surrounding the CHD near but not involving the portal vein and the hepatic artery. The remaining bulk of the mass was located further upstream around the right hepatic duct and right lobe of the liver and could not be imaged by endoscopic ultrasound through the duodenal bulb. A small amount of peritumoral/perihepatic ascites was also detected, as was one small peritumoral lymph node. The fine needle aspiration was suspicious for a neoplasm. However, only a few small clusters of atypical columnar epithelial cells and a few small-sized lymphocytes were identified. These findings precluded a specific diagnosis, but a well-differentiated carcinoma could not be ruled out. The aspiration of ascitic fluid could not identify any malignant cells. The sample consisted mainly of blood with reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and clusters of cells of possible glandular or gastrointestinal luminal origin. The patient was scheduled to be operated with a diagnosis of Klatskin tumor. After exploration of the abdominal cavity, extensive tumor infiltration of the hilum, right and left main hepatic ducts, and the right lobe of liver was noted. The liver was normal with a well formed left lateral segment, which was estimated to be 600 g. Intraoperative ultrasound examination was used to identify the tumor margins and possible large vein and intrahepatic infiltration. The tumor was noted to involve a hepatic vein to segment 6, near the anterior wall of the vena cava. The main portal vein and right portal vein were also infiltrated by the tumor. Thus, an extended right hepatectomy, including removal of the caudate lobe, was performed. The left hepatic duct was dissected to get a clear margin of the infiltrating tumor and parenchymal transection was performed after a 10-minute ischemic preconditioning and a total clamp time of 40 minutes, using the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator and cautery to limit blood loss. An end-to-end anastomosis between the main trunk of the portal vein and the left portal vein was performed as was a Roux-en-Y bilioenteric anastomosis for biliary drainage of segments 2 and 3 of the liver. On gross examination, a firm white tan mass measuring 7.5 × 5.0 cm was seen involving segments VI and VII and the common bile duct. Multiple sections from the common bile duct showed a markedly thickened bile duct wall due to a dense, predominantly nodular lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis (Fig. 1A). Sections from the hilar area as well as from the region of the left and right hepatic ducts showed similar histologic features (Fig. 1B, C). The infiltrating lymphocytes comprised a mixture of small cells with angulated nuclei, fine chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm (centrocyte-like cells) and large cells with large vesicular nuclei, multiple small nucleoli, and moderate amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm (centroblast-like cells) (Fig. 1D). The mean centroblast count was >15 per high-power field. A minor component of a diffuse pattern of infiltration was seen (30%), with foci of fine reticular fibrosis seen in these areas (Fig. 1B). The morphologic findings were consistent with a high-grade or follicular large cell lymphoma (grade 3A) arising in the wall of the bile duct. Immunohistochemical stains of the bile duct sections confirmed the histologic impression. The neoplastic lymphocytes had the following phenotype: CD20+, BCL6+, CD10?, MUM1?, CD5?, BCL2?, CD45+, and CD43? (Fig. 1E-I). Numerous infiltrating, small-sized reactive T cells (CD3+, CD5+) were also seen with a predominance of CD4+ T cells. A stain for CD21 highlighted expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks that had rounded contours (Fig. 1F). A stain for Ki-67 showed a markedly elevated proliferation index within the follicles (80%); overall, however, it was lower (30%). In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNAs was negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement demonstrated a clonal product. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses using break-apart probes for the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH), BCL2, BCL6, and MALT1 showed no translocations of any of these genes. The morphologic and phenotypic features, in conjunction with localization of the lymphoma to the biliary tree (no involvement of the portal lymph nodes and negative staging bone marrow biopsy), indicated a primary follicular lymphoma of the bile duct. The patient received postoperative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone in conjunction with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituxan (CHOP-R regimen). The patient is alive and well without evidence of disease more than 40 months after completion of chemotherapy. "

560,S2213-0896(15)00008-0,Recurrence of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive adenocarcinoma after 17 years: Case report," 2 Presentation of case A 58-year-old male ex-smoker of Chinese ethnicity underwent a left upper lobectomy in 1995 for a stage 1A (T1N0M0) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) – adenocarcinoma subtype. He did not receive any adjuvant treatment. Subsequently he was followed annually, and although remaining asymptomatic, chest X-ray changes in 2012 mandated investigation. CT chest, CT head and PET scan demonstrated pleural and mediastinal lymphadenoapthy, but no evidence of extra-thoracic spread. His stage at relapse was TxN2M1a. A pleural core biopsy confirmed malignancy consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 and CK7 positive; CK20, WT-1 and Calretinin negative ( Fig. 1)). Cells had cytoplasmic mucicarmine positive mucin vacuoles imparting signet ring appearance. Immunohistochemistry performed for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein, demonstrated diffuse and strong immunoreactivity in tumor cells but tissue was insufficient to confirm ALK gene-rearrangement by Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis or to perform EGFR mutation status. Due to the absence of a radiologically identifiable new lung primary, the 1995 NSCLC specimen was retrieved. Interestingly, the pleura and the lobectomy specimens were identical. The resection specimen showed diffuse and strong (3+) ALK immunoreactivity. It was confirmed by FISH assay using a split probe ( Fig. 2). The patient subsequently commenced crizotinib, which has been well tolerated, apart from intermittent grade 1 diarrhea, blurry vision and fatigue. A restaging CT chest after 4 months has demonstrated a significant partial response to therapy ( Fig. 3). Two years elapsed since starting crizotinib and he is doing well with stable disease. "
561,S1756-2317(09)00067-X,Synchronous adenocarcinoma and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the colon: a case report," Case report This 77-year-old woman clinically presented with tiredness and leg pains, but no gastrointestinal tract symptoms. The past medical history included a hysterectomy for benign disease, a cholecystectomy and ischaemic heart disease. She was found to have iron-deficiency anaemia, for which she was investigated further. An upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was normal. Colonoscopy showed a tumour in the hepatic flexure, which was proven to be an adenocarcinoma on biopsy. For this, she underwent a right hemicolectomy. Macroscopically, the hemicolectomy specimen showed a polypoid tumour in the ascending colon, measuring 35 mm in maximum dimension. Histologically, this was a moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma arising against a background of a villous adenoma. The tumour invaded into, but not beyond, the muscularis propria (pT2). Fourteen lymph nodes were recovered from the specimen, none of which contained metastatic carcinoma. In addition, however, the bowel wall showed a rather subtle, nodular infiltrate of relatively monotonous small lymphoid cells, which were present within the submucosa, muscularis propria and pericolic fat surrounding the carcinoma (Figures 1–4    ). The lymphoid cells did not infiltrate the mucosa and no lympho-epithelial lesions were identified. The regional nodes, although not very enlarged, showed partial effacement of the architecture, with infiltration by similar lymphoid cells. These cells were small-sized lymphocytes, similar to those seen in the bowel wall, which had round to oval nuclei, with clumped chromatin and small, but distinct, eosinophilic nucleoli. The cytoplasmic rim was narrow and relatively darkly stained. There was no plasmacytoid or monocytoid differentiation and blasts were very scanty. The cells occupied and replaced pre-existing follicles, imparting a prominent nodular growth pattern (Figures 5–7   ). Immunohistochemically, these small lymphoid cells were CD20 positive and showed kappa light chain restriction; CD3, CD5, CD10, CD21, CD23, CD138, IgD, IgM, p53, bcl-6 and cyclin D1 were negative (Figure 8 ). CD3 and CD5 stains demonstrated background T lymphocytes, while a few residual follicular centres were highlighted by CD21 and CD23, which stained the follicular dendritic cell meshwork. The proliferative fraction was less than 5%. The overall features were those of a marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. The patient received no adjuvant treatment for the carcinoma. She was referred to a haematologist for management of the lymphoma. Her blood counts and bone marrow were normal and she was clinically asymptomatic. A CT scan showed no mediastinal, retroperitoneal or pelvic lymphadenopathy nor any focal intra-abdominal lesion or splenomegaly. Therefore no further treatment was offered and she is alive and well at the time of writing this report. "
562,S2352-5878(15)00038-8,The non-specific symptoms of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma resulting in delayed diagnosis: A case-based review," Case report A 42-year-old woman underwent bilateral cosmetic breast augmentation with McGhan silicone implants in 2004. The patient had an uneventful postoperative period without any complications until 2011, when she presented with a 2-month history of spontaneous enlargement and tenderness of the left breast. There was no history of trauma and no systemic symptoms at presentation. On examination, the left breast was not tender but was slightly bigger than the right breast. There was no sign of capsular contracture and no palpable lymphadenopathy. The findings of routine blood investigations were normal. Breast ultrasonography and mammography revealed a localized collection of liquid beyond the implant suggestive of implant leakage. Therefore, the patient underwent bilateral implant removal. However, both implants were intact, and on the left side, approximately 1 L of serous fluid was drained. Cultures were negative for bacterial growth. Excision of the fibrous capsule around the implants (capsulectomy) was not performed, because during that period, BIA-ALCL was not suspected because of the non-specific symptoms. The implants were not replaced. During the following years, the patient developed a firm distinct mass in the left breast. In 2015, mammography and ultrasonography revealed a possible fibrous capsular structure with seroma in the left breast. The patient underwent left-sided capsulectomy with excision of a firm capsular structure containing a seroma (Figure. 1 ). On histopathological analysis, ALCL, which was ALK negative, was found confined within the fibrous capsule surrounding the implant. A PET-CT scan was performed and demonstrated no abnormality or signs of systemic disease. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of lymphoma involvement, and the findings of blood investigations were normal. The patient has remained clinically well postoperatively without any B symptoms. She is currently receiving three series of cytotoxic CHOP chemotherapy and radiation therapy under the care of hematologists. "

566,S1930-0433(18)30078-5,Diffuse-primary-B-cell lymphoma of the cranial vault presenting as stroke," Case presentation A 74-year-old woman came to our emergency room for acute aphasia, left limb weakness, and an acute confusional state. Her family members spoke of an episode of a syncopal episode 3 months earlier. The neurologic examination showed a mild left-sided hemiparesis (Muscle scale grades MRC 4/5). A cerebral computed tomography (CT) revealed a subcortical hypodense area in the temporal lobe (Fig. 1A ), which was interpreted as a subacute phase of ischemia. A bone window view showed, on the right parietal diploic space, a focal area of sclerosis and a mild bulging scalp, which were deemed less relevant (Fig. 1B). Therefore, an anticoagulant oral therapy (aspirin 300 mg/d) was commenced. However, the patient's confusional state continued to worsen and clinicians requested a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 48 hours later. The morphologic sequences highlighted in the right parietal-temporal diploe a more extensively altered signal, which resulted hypointense on both T2 and T1 sequences (Fig. 2A and B ). A correlated dural-based hysointense mass on T1 and T2 (Fig. 2A) was also observed, with restricted diffusion and was surrounded by a hyperintense edema (Fig. 2C). Additionally, the near scalp showed restricted diffusion with low apparent diffusion coefficient (mean apparent diffusion coefficient value 0.784?×?10?3?mm2/s) (Fig. 2D). The study was completed by gadolinium-based contrast agent administration and the same areas were enhanced homogeneously (Fig. 3A ). An indistinguishable border from the meninges to the brain cortex was also described (Fig. 3C), with right parietal sulci leptomeningeal involvement (Fig. 3B and D). The initial diagnosis was a primary extracranic tumor with intracranic extension. The patient was initially treated with methylprednisolone (1000 mg/d intravenously) and levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily). An accurate workup showed a normal white blood cell counts (6.78?×?109/L), with 62% neutrophils, lymphocytes 26%, and a normal platelet counts. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, mean cell volume, and other laboratory values, including electrolytes, creatinine, and liver enzymes, were in the normal range. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value was 154 U/L, also normal. The patient tested negative for HIV virus and the thorax-abdominal CT showed no other primary tumoral localizations. However, when a craniectomy with both scalp bone and intracranial tumor excisions were carried out, a grayish white tumor with a soft consistency was found (Fig. 4A ). The parenchymal infiltration and the involvement of right temporal muscle were confirmed. The histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a diffuse-primary-B-cell lymphoma (Fig. 4B and C) with immunohistochemistry CD20+, CD10+/?, PAX5+, BCL6+, BCL2+/? and Cyclin D1?, MUM1?, CD23?, and high cell proliferation index (Ki67?>?60%) (Fig. 4D). A bone marrow biopsy from the posterior iliac crest resulted negative for lymphoma. The patient was then given a chemotherapy regimen consisting of 4 cycles of R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) every 3 weeks. After 6 months of therapy, the patient showed no signs of systemic dissemination. "

572,S0145-2126(08)00476-1,Renal intravascular large B-cell lymphoma with early diagnosis by renal biopsy: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 52-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of edema of his lower extremities and mild renal dysfunction. A superficial lymph node was not palpated. Laboratory examination showed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 104,000/?l, creatinine level of 2.98mg/dl, urea nitrogen level of 45mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 577IU/l, ferritin level of 728ng/ml, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level of 8110U/ml. Urinary beta 2 microglobulin excretion was increased (7710mEq/l). Computed tomography (CT) revealed markedly enlarged bilateral kidneys but no lymphadenopathy. To investigate the origin of renal dysfunction, we performed a renal biopsy. Histopathological examination of the renal biopsy specimens showed that the glomerular capillary lumens were filled with large, atypical mononuclear cells (Fig. 1a). In the interstitium, a large amount of mononuclear cell infiltration was seen. Upon immunohistochemical staining, the proliferating cells were phenotypically characterized to be CD3?, CD20+ (Fig. 1b), CD5?, CD10?, BCL2+ (Fig. 1c), BCL6+ (Fig. 1d), and MUM-1+. The MIB-1 (anti-Ki-67) index was estimated to be approximately 50%. Flow cytometric analysis of the cells in the renal biopsy specimen revealed that the major cell population was CD3?, CD4?, CD5?, CD8?, CD10?, CD19+, CD20+, and CD56?. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having IVLBCL [non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) type]. Peripheral and bone marrow smears, and bone marrow biopsy revealed no lymphoma cells. Systemic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed no abnormal uptake of FDG. The patient was treated with 8 cycles of rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy (R-CHOP). He achieved CR, has been progression-free for 26 months, and is currently alive. "
575,S0190-9622(08)02465-1,Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma expressing FOXP3: A case report supporting the existence of malignancies of regulatory T cells," Case report In May 2005, a 72-year-old man was referred to the center for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of cutaneous lymphomas of our department because of the presence of a 3-month history of multiple erythematous patches associated with few papulonodular and blistering lesions located on the lower extremities and on the trunk (Fig 1 , A and B). His medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension. Histologic examination was consistent with an epidermotropic pleomorphic medium-/large-cell CTCL (primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified) according to the WHO-EORTC classification. 1  Immunohistochemical studies (see Table I  for the antibody reagent used) on frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue using a commercially available kit (cod.K5005 Dako REAL, Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) demonstrated that the neoplastic cells had an ?/? T-helper phenotype (CD3+, CD4+, ?F1+, T-cell receptor [TCR]-?1–, CD56–); most of the neoplastic cells were proliferating (mindbomb homolog 1 [MIB]-1+) and expressed the CD30 antigen. TCR-? gene rearrangement analysis of a biopsy specimen from lesional skin, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique as previously described, 9  showed a monoclonal gene rearrangement. Staging studies excluded extracutaneous involvement by the lymphoma. Considering the CD30 expression, the patient was initially treated with oral methotrexate (10 mg/wk) for 2 months with a good clinical response. However, based on the occurrence of new ulcerated nodules in the gluteal region that had proved to be resistant to methotrexate, therapy with oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg/d) was started, inducing only partial regression of the above skin lesions within a 6-month period. The patient was then given oral acitretin (25 mg/d) in combination with two cycles of narrowband ultraviolet B (18 treatments/cycle for a total of 36 treatments) that, after 3 months, failed to elicit satisfactory clinical improvement. In the following months, multiple papulonodular skin lesions partially confluent into ulcerated plaques developed over both extremities, particularly legs and thighs. In May 2007, oral bexarotene (300 mg/d) was introduced, leading to resolution of some nodules within 2 months; however, crops of similar lesions progressively appeared on other body sites (Fig 1, C). Chlorambucil (6 mg) on alternate days was added, but the cutaneous picture rapidly worsened and persistent fever (39°C) occurred, requiring the patient's hospitalization and repeated staging in January 2008. On admission, the clinical presentation consisted of disseminated nodules, tumors, and plaques, most of which had an ulcerated, hemorrhagic surface resembling pyoderma gangrenosum, with blistering and exudative features (Fig 1, D). There was mild enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes. Routine laboratory tests including complete blood cell count, lymphoid subsets, glucose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, protein electrophoresis, liver and renal function tests, and urinalysis demonstrated, in addition to the known hyperglycemia, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (84 mm/h; normal 1-20) and moderate anemia (hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL; normal range: 12-16). Serum ?2-microglobulin was also elevated (3.6 mg/mL, normal range: 0.6-2.6). Serological tests for Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus suggested previous infection, whereas serology for hepatitis B and C viruses and human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8 produced negative findings. Serology for human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1/2, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercially available kit, also gave negative results. Furthermore, PCR analysis for human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1/2 genes on DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as previously reported, 10  revealed negative findings. Histology from a recent nodule showed a massive infiltrate of atypical medium/large pleomorphic lymphocytes with a discrete number of blastic lymphoid cells throughout the entire dermis, with diffuse infiltration of the epidermis, consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified (Fig 2 , A and B). Specimens for electron microscopy were fixed for 4 hours in Karnovsky solution (paraformaldehyde and glutaraldheide mixture) and then in ice-cold phosphate-buffered osmic acid for 3 hours, and finally dehydrated in alcohol and embedded in epoxy resin. The tissue was sectioned, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with an electron microscope (CM10, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The ultrastructural analysis showed a dense infiltrate of atypical neoplastic cells, macrophages, and plasmacytes. Neoplastic cells showed an irregularly shaped plasma membrane, with pseudopodia and an abundant cytoplasm in which several elongated/fused mitochondria, lysosomes, coated vesicles, and a well-developed Golgi apparatus were evident. The morphology of the nuclei ranged from cleaved to clearly cerebriform showing a Sézary-like cytomorphology (Fig 2, C and D). The immunohistochemical findings are reported in Table II . It is of interest that almost all the neoplastic cells, which were CD3+ (Fig 3 , A and C), CD4+, CD25+ T lymphocytes, strongly expressed the FOXP3 antigen (Fig 3, B and D). TCR-? gene rearrangement by PCR on DNA extracted from cutaneous lesions confirmed the monoclonal nature of the disease, whereas it was negative on DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow. Cytogenetic analysis from lesional skin failed to disclose any chromosomal abnormality. PCR and nested PCR analysis for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-2, 11  HHV-8, 12  and panherpes virus 13  genes on DNA extracted from lesional skin yielded negative results. The TCR-? gene rearrangement was analyzed by PCR, as described above, 9  on DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, revealing a polyclonal pattern. Bone-marrow aspirate and biopsy failed to disclose pathological findings. Encephalic and thoracoabdominal computed tomographic scans ruled out both systemic disease and infectious infiltrates. In contrast, repeated blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Corynebacterium striatum; S aureus also was isolated from lesional skin cultures. Systemic antibiotic therapy was administered with intravenous teicoplanin (400 mg/d), leading to resolution of the fever within 2 weeks. Based on the refractory clinical behavior of the disorder, treatment with the human anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) zanolimumab was initiated. Zanolimumab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 980 mg weekly. This drug was well tolerated, but, after 13 infusions, failed to induce a significant improvement. In June 2008, the patient was then treated with 5 cycles of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide-hydroxy daunorubicin-oncovincristine, and prednisone) in association with bexarotene at the dose of 525 mg daily inducing a slowly progressive regression of most nodules and plaques. Currently, the patient is receiving only bexarotene (400 mg/d), with the appearance of no new lesions. "
577,S2212-4268(17)30205-1,Widely disseminated sporadic Burkitt lymphoma initially presented as oral manifestations in a 6-year-old boy," 2 Case report A 6-year-old boy visited for an evaluation of hypermobility of the maxillary right first molar. The boy’s past medical history was non-specific, and he had no history of progressive systemic symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, or fever. Intraoral examination revealed painless gingival and mucosal swelling in both posterior maxillas and mandibles. Furthermore, the right mandibular first molar was tilted lingually. A periapical radiograph (Fig. 1 A) showed severe alveolar bone resorption around the maxillary right first molar, with uncompleted root development. A panoramic (Fig. 1B) view showed loss of the lamina dura around all four first molars. Enlarged follicular spaces were also observed in both mandibular second premolars. Cone-beam computed tomography (CT) images (Fig. 1C and D) showed large tumorous lesions occupying both maxillary sinuses, causing partial resorption of the sinus wall. Histopathologic findings of the buccal mucosa of the upper right first molar showed sheets of monomorphic lymphoid cells and intervening phagocytic cells, imparting a “starry-sky appearance”. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD10, CD20, and MUM1, which are specific to B-cell lymphocytes and late stages of B-cell differentiation. Ki-67 staining was positive in more than 95% of the cells, revealing high proliferative activity. Overall, histopathology results supported the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. The patient was immediately referred to the Hematology-Oncology Department for definitive care. Subsequent abdominal CT, bone scan, and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT (Fig. 2 ) revealed multiple lesions involving the right abdominal cavity, pancreas, multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and left gastric, splenic and portocaval areas as well as multiple bone lesions. Bone marrow involvement was also observed. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV Burkitt lymphoma. The patient was treated with several courses of intensive chemotherapy, and has been in remission for 20 months. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, it was granted an exemption in writing by the institutional review board (IRB) of Pusan National University Dental Hospital (IRB No. PNUDH-2017-13). "
587,S1092-9134(08)00135-4,Primary lymphomas of the breast: a report on 5 cases studied in a period of 5 years at the Hospital General de México," 2 Material and methods This is a retrospective and descriptive study of 5 cases of primary breast lymphomas in female patients studied in a period of 5 years (2002-2007) (Figs. 1-5     ). We reviewed the clinical records of every one of these patients and assessed the following clinical variables: age, affected breast(s), clinical characteristics, presence or absence of nodal involvement, and biopsy of the bone marrow in search of systemic lymphatic-proliferative disease. We collected the hematoxylin-eosin (H-E)–stained slides and the immunoreactions of the performed biopsies from the surgical pathology files. From the obtained biopsy specimens, the tissue was fixed in 10% formaldehyde; 4-?m–thick sections were made and stained with H-E, Schiff periodic acid, and Giemsa for each case. Bone marrow biopsies were decalcified, fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and included in paraffin for routine staining. The immunohistochemical technique was performed by means of the avidin-biotin-peroxidase reaction. The following monoclonal antibodies were assessed: CD20 (1:100), CD79a (1:50), bcl2 (1:50), bcl6 (1:10), CD10 (1:20), Ki-67 (1:100), as well as the ? and ? light chains (1:50).

He was treated with highly active antiretroviral treatment for 9 years. In January 2005, he developed hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathies (axillary, submandibular, and parotideal), and lymphocytosis (lymphocyte count, 17.1 × 109/L). Hemoglobin concentration was 8.9 g/dL (89 g/L), platelet count 20?000/?L (20 × 109/L), serum lactate dehydrogenase 2016 IU/L, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 1. Immunophenotype studies and a bone marrow biopsy were conclusive for a T-LBL. Polymerase chain reaction assays of serum samples showed negative results for human herpesvirus 8 and parvovirus B19. The patient received several cycles of chemotherapy, achieving complete remission. After 9 months he was treated for a relapse, achieving a second complete remission. One year later, a bone marrow biopsy documented a second relapse. The patient did not respond to a second line of chemotherapy and was then referred to our institution. A bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow infiltrated with precursor T lymphoblasts that had very condensed nuclear chromatin, no evident nucleoli, and a high number of mitotic figures (Fig. 1A). In smears, the cells are medium-sized with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Immunoperoxidase stains showed that neoplastic cells were positive for CD3 (Fig. 1B), TdT (Fig. 1C), CD45, CD10, CD1a, CD2, CD7, CD5, and CD43 (focal). The proliferation rate was approximately 70%, assessed by Ki-67/MIB-1 staining. The lymphoblasts were negative for CD20, CD79a, MUM1, CD68, CD30, Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein, and human herpesvirus 8. In situ hybridization showed the samples were negative for Epstein-Barr viral early RNA. Flow cytometry of the marrow aspirate revealed an intermediate/cortical T-lymphoblastic phenotype: negative for surface CD3 (Fig. 2A) and positive for cytoplasmic CD3 (Fig. 2B), CD1a (Fig. 2A-B), TdT, CD2, CD7, CD5, and CD8, with partial coexpression of dimCD4 (Fig. 2C). Cytoplasmic staining with monoclonal antibody ?F1 [2] demonstrated cytoplasmic T-cell receptor (TCR) ? chains (Fig. 2D). Analysis of TCR? polymerase chain reaction products [3] showed 2 clonal peaks (Fig. 3A), which corresponded to the TCR? variable genes TRG V2*01/J1*02 and TRG V3*01/J1*02. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 3B and C. The TRG V2*01/J1*02 gene contained a stop codon in the deduced amino acid sequence. Intraclonal diversity was not present in either of the 2 samples (data not shown). The patient received salvage chemotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy. After bone marrow recovery, a restaging documented complete remission. Because of the slow resolution of life-threatening interstitial pneumonitis that developed during the aplastic phase, a second consolidation therapy was not administered. After 5 months, immunophenotypic studies documented a relapse in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. The patient started a palliative chemotherapy and died after 2 months of treatment. "

The swollen lymph node was excised at the end of March 1989. He subsequently developed right subclavicular and paraaortal lymph node swellings and fever; therefore, he was clinically diagnosed as having stage IIIB disease. He was treated with a mixture of endoxan, oncovin, adriacin, predonisone, methotrexate, and pepleomycin sulfate (modified CHOP antineoplastic regimen). In 1991, axillary and paraaortal lymph node swellings recurred. He was treated with the above-mentioned antineoplastic regimen, and he remained in complete remission. At the end of October 2007 (at the age of 48), he visited our hospital because of high fever and headache. His soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level was 5,406U/ml (normal range: 190–650). Bone marrow aspiration was performed the next day. At the beginning of November, sIL-2R increased to 14,026, the platelet count decreased to 12×103/?l (140–322×103), D-dimer was 192.8?g/ml (<1.00), and fibrin/fibrinogen degeneration product (FDP) was 496.1?g/ml (<5.0). Soluble interleukin-2 receptor was measured, but cytokines were not checked. Hemophagocytic syndrome-related symptoms were fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed; multiple organ failure finally occurred, caused by hepatic failure and tumor cell invasion. He was treated with VP16 and gabexate mesilate (FOY), but died in the middle of December 2007. An autopsy was not performed. "

Clinical examination and imaging showed Waldeyer ring lesions morphologically consistent with the diagnosis of lymphoma. Multiple biopsies were performed on the right tonsil, left pharyngeal wall, left lingual tonsil, cavum, and nasal cavity. Bone marrow biopsy was normal. Intense uptake zones in the mediastinum, peribronchial, and subdiaphragmatic regions were detected by positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Corticoid treatment was started, and follow-up involving physical examinations and PET scan was performed every 3 to 6 months. Several small fragments were sampled. The diffuse and partially nodular patterns found were suggestive of a small B-cell lymphoma. Neoplastic cells were positive for CD20, CD5, immunoglobulin (Ig) D, and Bcl-2; cyclin D1 was only detected in some cells, at a low level. The initial diagnosis was that of a partially nodular small B-cell lymphoma, probably of mantle cell origin. Follicular hyperplasia or FL was not identified. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the FR3 locus revealed a clear monoclonal band. Analyses of the IgH FR1 and FR2, Bcl-1, and Bcl-2 loci were not interpretable because of DNA degradation. One year later, the patient complained of the same symptoms. A discrete right cervical lymphadenopathy was found, but oropharyngeal examination and regional PET scan did not reveal any other lesion. Imaging studies showed a reduction of the subdiaphragmatic and peribronchial masses. The lymph node biopsy was then performed and sent to our department. "

The mass was detected incidentally one month previously, and he had no history of conjunctivitis. Physical examination revealed a large, 2cm, pinkish mass involving the entire area of the left tarsal conjunctiva, which caused medial ectropion (Fig. 1 ). An incisional biopsy was done. Histological examination showed monomorphous small-to-medium sized lymphoid cell proliferation. The cells infiltrated the subepithelial tissue in a diffuse pattern without nodular architecture. Tumor cells had condensed chromatin, slightly irregular nuclear membranes, and indistinct nucleoli (Fig. 2 A). The mitotic rate measured 4/10 HPF. Plasma cells or immunoblastic cells were rare. The surface epithelium was thin, and lymphoepithelial lesion was not evident. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the TechMate™ 500 Plus (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) according to the manufacturer's protocol based on the labeled streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method. The primary antibody used, the methods of antigen retrieval, and the dilution rate were as follows: CD20 (L26) (DAKO; microwave in citrate buffer; 1:200), CD3 (DAKO; microwave in citrate buffer; 1:100), CD5 (DAKO; microwave in citrate buffer; 1:50), CD10 (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK; steamer in citrate buffer; 1:30), CD23 (Labvision, Fremont, CA; microwave in citrate buffer; 1:50), bcl2 (DAKO; steamer in citrate buffer; 1:50), cyclin D1 (Labvision; pressure cooker in citrate buffer; 1:100), and Ki-67 (DAKO; microwave in EDTA buffer; 1:1000). The tumor cells were positive for CD20 (L26), bcl-2, and cyclin D1 (Fig. 2B and C), and negative for CD5, CD10, and CD23. The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 15%. In semi-nested PCR assays for IGH gene rearrangement, monoclonal B-cell proliferation was detected. t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation between the IGH and the CYCLIN D1 (CCND1) genes was observed in fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using an LSI IGH/CCND1 XT dual color, dual fusion translocation probe (Abbott-Vysis, Downers Grove, IL; Fig. 2D). MALT1 gene translocation was not found in FISH analysis using a MALT1 (18q21) dual color, break apart probe (Abbott-Vysis). Therefore, the final pathologic diagnosis was MCL. During the clinical work-up for staging, atypical lymphoid aggregates, suggesting involvement of a lymphoma, were noted in the bone marrow. Chest and abdomen CT revealed no lymph node enlargement. However, hepatosplenomegaly was observed. The patient received chemotherapy consisting of cytoxan, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). "

Approximately 10–20% of patients have a history of immunosuppression, either through treatment for malignancy (such as in Hodgkin Lymphoma or acute myeloid leukaemia), inflammatory conditions (e.g. infliximab use in inflammatory bowel disease), or solid organ transplants. 6,7  The majority of patients have liver, spleen, and bone marrow involvement at presentation. As a result they tend to be jaundiced, anaemic, have prominent hepatosplenomegaly, minimal lymphadenopathy, and constitutional or ‘B’ symptoms. Thrombocytopaenia is commonly seen, although this may be part of a broader pancytopaenia. The cause of the cytopaenias is multifactorial: marrow infiltration, splenic sequestration, haemolytic anaemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopaenia, or haemophagocytic syndrome either alone or in combination. Neutropaenia is less commonly encountered. Peripheral blood spill of malignant cells occurs in the leukaemic phase of the disease. 4,7  The immunophenotype of the malignant cells is typically: CD2+, CD3+, ??TCR+, CD4?, CD5?, CD8?, CD±56. 8  An isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 7 (i(7)(q10)) is a recurrent genetic abnormality described in HSTCL either in isolation or in association with other abnormalities, most notably trisomy 8, with the combination of these two abnormalities being highly suggestive of HSTCL. 9  "

All pathologic materials, such as hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry (CD3, CD20, CD4, CD8, CD10, BCL6, TIA1, granzyme B, TCR?F1, TCR?, CD56, CD30, and CD21), EBV in situ hybridization (ISH), and T-cell clonality testing, were reviewed by all authors together for a consensus of the diagnosis. For the selection of eligible cases, clinical information including past medical history, extranodal involvement sites, and bone marrow (BM) status were also considered. The minimal inclusion criteria for the diagnosis of EBV-positive nodal T/NK-cell lymphoma in this study were as follows: (1) absence of nasal lesions, (2) predominantly nodal presentation, (3) EBV positive by ISH in more than 30% of neoplastic T or NK cells, (4) exclusion of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma by additional immunostaining for follicular dendritic cell and follicular helper T-cell markers, (5) absence of BM involvement in the case of NK-cell lineage to exclude ANKL, (6) no evidence of immunodeficiency, (7) no previous history of chronic EBV-associated illness. Ultimately, a total of 15 cases were confirmed to be EBV-positive nodal T/NK-cell lymphoma and included in this study. Four patients (cases 7, 8, 9, and 10) had been included in a previous study [11]. Clinical data were retrieved from medical records and included the primary site, involved sites, and number of extranodal involvement sites (excluding the spleen), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, serum lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase levels, B symptoms, BM involvement, Ann Arbor stage, International Prognostic Index (IPI), prognostic index for PTCL (PIT), complete blood count, chemotherapy regimen, treatment response, and clinical outcome. The studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Samsung Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB No. 2014-08-106).   2.2 Pathologic analysis: histopathology, immunohistochemistry, EBV ISH, T-cell clonality test, dual EBV ISH/immunohistochemistry, and determination of EBV-positive cell lineage Histopathologic features were evaluated by reviewing hematoxylin-eosin slides. Immunohistochemistry for CD3 (F7.2.38, Dako; Carpinteria, CA), CD20 (L26, Dako), CD4 (4B12, Thermo Scientific; Waltham, MA), CD8 (SP16, Thermo Scientific), TIA1 (Immunotec Inc; Swanton, VT), granzyme B (GZB01, Thermo Scientific), perforin (MRQ-23, Cell Marque; Rocklin, CA), CD56 (123C3, Zymed; San Francisco, CA), T-cell receptor (TCR) ?F1 (8A3, Thermo Scientific), TCR? (?3.20, Thermo Scientific), and CD30 (Ber-H2, Dako) was performed. The expression of immunomarkers was considered to be positive if more than 30% of neoplastic cells were immunostained or, to be focal positive, if 10% to 30% of neoplastic cells were immunostained. Epstein-Barr virus was detected by ISH using a Bond Ready-to-Use ISH EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) probe (Leica Biosystems; Newcastle, UK) or an INFORM EBER Probe (Ventana Medical Systems; Tucson, AZ). T-cell clonality testing was carried out using multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the TCR? gene and heteroduplex analysis or Biomed-2 TCR? and TCR? gene rearrangement assays (InVivoScribe Technologies; San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Determination of cell lineage of EBV-positive cells was inferred from overlapping percentages of positive cells by examining the pathologic slides under the multihead microscope by all authors. In 7 cases (case 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, and 15), dual EBV ISH/immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD4, CD8, or CD56 was performed using the Benchmark XT automated immunostainer (Ventana Medical Systems). In brief, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were first stained for EBER using the ISH protocol described earlier with iView Blue Detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems) resulting in a blue stain. The sections were then incubated with a primary antibody for CD3, CD4, CD8, or CD56 and visualized using the Ultraview DAB kit (Ventana Medical Systems).   2.3 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 (IBM; Armonk, NY). Correlations between variables were evaluated using a 2-sided Fisher exact test. Patient survival was plotted using a Kaplan-Meier curve. P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.  "
629,S0899-7071(15)00040-6,F-18 FDG PET/MRI findings of primary breast lymphoma in two cases FDG PET/MRI findings of primary breast lymphoma," 2 Case 1 In July 2012, a 35-year-old woman presented with a right breast lump of 3weeks duration. She had no fever and no evidence of weight loss or night sweats. A core needle biopsy revealed a DLBCL. The patient was referred for DLBCL characterization and staging by FDG PET/MR. PET/MR scan was performed using an integrated system (Biograph mMR; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Initially, a supine whole-body PET/MR scan was performed and, then, PET/MR mammography (PMM) was performed in the prone position using a dedicated breast coil. The PMM protocol comprised a breast PET scan for 8min with simultaneous breast MRI. The PMM revealed three intensely FDG-avid masses—sized 4.5cm, 2cm, and 1.3cm—in the right breast with SUVmax of 17.07, 6.28, and 4.65, respectively (Fig. 1 ). There was no evidence of other organ involvement. All three tumors had similar appearances on MR images. The following description focuses on the largest mass. The well-defined oval mass was homogeneously isointense on T1w images and slightly hypointense with internal linear structure on fat-saturated (fs) T2w images. DWI revealed relatively homogeneous signals of high intensity with an ADC value of 0.711×10?3 mm2/s. DCE MRI demonstrated intense and heterogeneous enhancement with rapid increase (peak enhancement value: 106%) and washout kinetics. Early images showed penetrating vessels in the mass, and delayed images showed peripheral enhancement with a multinodular appearance and intratumoral septal enhancement [5]. The high FDG avidity portion of the tumor showed rapid increase and washout kinetics; however, the low FDG avidity portion showed slow initial enhancement or plateau kinetics. DWI showed tumor margins similar to those of PET but presented a low ADC relatively uniform. The patient underwent sixth cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy and radiotherapy (4000cGy). FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) scans after 3cycles of chemotherapy and 16months after the completion of therapy showed reduced FDG uptake and resolution of all three lesions, respectively. However, routine follow-up PET/CT discovered recurred DLBCL at 20months after the therapy, which was confirmed by biopsy. "
630,S1808-8694(15)30583-8,Oral Burkitt's Lymphoma - Case Report," REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AND THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Burkitt's lymphoma is a rare poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma characterized by monoclonal proliferation of B-lymphocytes. 5  Cytogenetically, there is rearrangement of the C-myc oncogene, which is characterized by the presence of typical translocations: t (8; 14) (q24; q32) or their rare variants: t (8; 22) (q24; q11) or t(2; 8) (q12; q24). 6,7   Various studies have strongly suggested an association between the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the pathogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma. DNA sequences of this virus may be found in B cells, and elevated anti-EBV antibodies are found in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. 3,4,6  The EBV inhibits programmed cell death and helps develop and maintain Burkitt's lymphoma. 8   Clinically, this disease occurs mostly in children. The incidence peaks between ages 3 and 8 years, and males are affected about twice as frequently as females. Lesions involve mostly the maxilla, the mandible and the abdomen. The most frequent signs of this disease in the mouth are local tumors and altered tooth mobility. Symptoms are sparse, consisting of local pain, tenderness and parestesia. 2,4,5   Ardekian et al. 5  reviewed the clinical features of 13 Burkitt's lymphoma cases, and found that eight patients were male, that the mean age was 15.3 years, and that the maxilla was the most commonly affected site. Boerma et al. 1  found a bimodal age distribution, with a first incidence peak between 6 and 10 years and a second incidence peak after age 60 years. Ukboko et al. 9  found that 51.2% of Burkitt's lymphomas occurred in maxillary bones. Nakagawa et al. 10  found 18 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma in a sample of 95 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases; the tumor site was the head and neck in five of the 18 cases. Radiographic findings in Burkitt's lymphoma include radiolucent images of bone destruction with poorly defined and irregular margins. 2,4  There is a “starry sky” microscopic aspect with small, diffusely proliferated, monomorphic, immature and undifferentiated lymphocytes interspaced by numerous macrophages within abundant cytoplasm. 5,7   Burkitt's lymphoma is treated preferentially with intensive chemotherapy; 5-year survival rates range between 75 and 95%, depending on the stage of the lesion at the time of diagnosis. 3,4   The differential diagnosis should be made with the following conditions: per apical lesions, ameloblastoma, other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, undifferentiated carcinomas and sarcomas, and leukemia. 2,5   "

There was no other evidence of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Biopsy performed from the anterior chest wall mass revealed features of Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosis variant (Fig. 2 ). Cellular bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed no evidence of lymphoma infiltrate. LDH value was within normal limits. Viral markers and pus from sternal lesion for acid fast bacilli were negative. Contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed lymphomatous involvement of sternum with homogenous nodes in prevascular region and left hilum (Fig. 3 ). There were also small lymph nodes in celiac axis, paraaortic and left renal hilar region. Liver showed multiple focal hypodense lesions in segments 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 with no obvious enhancement. Spleen was enlarged with few focal hypodense lesions. The clinical impression was of Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosis, Stage IVB. Patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy with ABVD.      Post-chemotherapy clinical examination showed complete resolution of the cervical lymphadenopathy without any response in the sternal mass. Sternal biopsy showed features of Hodgkin's lymphoma morphologically similar to the previous biopsy. Repeat contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed sternal destruction with associated presternal and retrosternal soft tissue density mass. There was complete resolution of the hepatosplenic lesions, prevascular, hilar and abdominal lymphadenopathy. Involved field radiotherapy with a dose of 27 Gy/15#/3 weeks followed by boost of 9 Gy/5#/1 week was delivered to the residual sternal lesion by 3D-conformal radiotherapy. One month after radiotherapy, there was near complete resolution of the sternal lesion (Fig. 4 ). On clinical examination, there was minimal induration in the manubrium sterni, however, with a new finding of right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. In view of disease progression, patient was planned for salvage chemotherapy with ICE regimen (detailed below) followed by assessment for autologous bone marrow transplant.      Following 3 cycles of chemotherapy, an 18F-FDG PET-CT was undertaken, which showed solitary uptake in the sternal area. Sternal biopsy showed only fibrocollagenous tissue. Repeat bone marrow biopsy and touch showed no evidence of lymphoma deposits. Patient was kept on follow-up for 3 months and is now scheduled for a second whole body PET scan. "
635,S1054-8807(07)00137-8,Primary cardiac cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma presenting with neurological deficits: a case report," 2 Clinical history A 37-year-old male patient presented with complaints of edema of the forehead, eyelids, and lips for 2 months; inability to open eyes; and difficulty in spitting, blowing, and sipping, with occasional nasal regurgitation and dysarthria, of 1 month duration. The edema subsided in a month, but he experienced progressive bilateral ptosis and dysarthria. During the week prior to his seeking neurological consultation, he developed dyspnea on exertion. There was no history of fluctuating neurological deficits, impaired consciousness, cognitive decline, diplopia, or vertigo. On physical examination, he was found to have frequent ectopics, muffled heart sounds, elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral-type dysarthria, bilateral nonfatiguable ptosis, lower motor neuron facial paresis, and restricted palatal movement. Abduction in the right eye and internal rotation of the left eye were the only ocular movements observed. The corneal reflex, pupillary reaction, and other sensations were preserved. Examination of ocular fundi, visual acuity, and fields yielded normal results. Examination of the motor and sensory systems did not reveal any abnormality. Hematological investigations, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and blood chemistry were within the normal range. Serum and CSF were nonreactive for HIV-1/2, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1, varicella zoster virus, Cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, echo virus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma, Pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterial antigen, antibody and immune complexes. In situ hybridization for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) performed on sections of the heart also yielded negative results. Immunostaining for JC virus on sections of the brain and the heart revealed negative results. Chest X-ray revealed gross cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous congestion. Electrocardiogram showed complete heart block. Echocardiogram revealed dilatation of both the right atrium and the right ventricle, and mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with reduced left and right ventricular functions. These features were suggestive of cardiomyopathy. Abdominal ultrasound features were suggestive of congestive cardiac failure. There was no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies revealed normal results. A provisional diagnosis of mitochondrial cytopathy with cardiac and neurological manifestations was considered. He received bronchodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. On the ninth day of hospital admission, he suddenly developed cardiorespiratory arrest and died. "
636,S0046-8177(08)00177-9,Translocation (18;22)(q21;q11) in B-cell lymphomas: a report of 4 cases and review of the literature," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case selection The files of our hospital were searched for cases of lymphoma or leukemia with t(18;22) between January 1993 and December 2005. Seven tumors with t(18;22) were identified of which only 4 had the t(18;22)(q21;q11). Wright-Giemsa–stained peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate smears and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained histologic sections of bone marrow aspirate clot and biopsy specimens were reviewed. A lymph node biopsy specimen was also available and reviewed in 1 case.   2.2 Immunophenotyping Four-color flow cytometric analysis was performed on peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, lymph node aspirate, or a cell suspension of a lymph node biopsy specimen on a FACS Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as described previously [5]. CD10 antibody was obtained from Coulter (Miami, FL), CD52 from Caltag/Invitrogen, (Carlsbad, CA), and FMC-7 from Immunotech/Coulter (Miami, FL). All other antibodies were from BD Biosciences. The panel of monoclonal antibodies included CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, FMC-7, and IG? and IG? light chains. These antibodies were conjugated either to peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex, fluorescein isothiocyanate, allophycocyanin, or phycoerythrin. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of bone marrow aspirate clot, core biopsy, and/or lymph node biopsy specimens. Monoclonal antibodies specific for BCL-2, BCL-6(DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), and cyclin D1 (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) were used along with appropriate positive and negative controls.   2.3 Conventional cytogenetics and FISH Conventional G-band karyotyping was performed on metaphase cells from peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, or a cell suspension of a lymph node (case 1) cultured for 24 or 48 hours using previously described methods [6]. FISH was performed on interphase nuclei or metaphases when available according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each case was assessed for BCL-2 and MALT-1 gene rearrangement using the LSI BCL-2 dual-color breakapart and LSI MALT-1 dual-color, breakapart probes, respectively (Vysis). Case 1 was also assessed using the LSI dual-color, dual-fusion translocation probes for IGH-BCL-2 and for CCND1-IGH (Vysis), respectively. Other cases were also assessed using a multi-color probe panel (Vysis) designed to detect multiple aberrations in CLL. These included the 11q22.3 (ATM gene), the 17p13.1 (p53 gene), the alpha satellite, centromeric region of chromosome 12 (D12Z3), the D13S319 locus in the 13q14.3, and the 13q34 region (LAMP1 gene) near the subtelomere of chromosome 13q. A total of 200 interphases were analyzed for each probe. The bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones RP11-1152K19 and RP11-165G5 were used to identify the breakpoint on IG?. These clones were purchased directly from the BACPAC Resources Center at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute and the FISH analysis was performed using methods described by others [7]. RP11-1152K19 and RP11-165G5 span the variable and constant clusters of the IG? gene, respectively.   2.4 Case reports  2.4.1 Case 1 A 54-year-old woman presented with nonspecific complaints of fatigue, night sweats, and itching. She had an elevated white blood count (WBC), and imaging studies found generalized lymphadenopathy. A fine-needle aspiration of cervical lymph node showed a mixed infiltrate of small and large cells. A subsequent biopsy of inguinal lymph node revealed grade 2 follicular lymphoma (FL) (Fig. 1A-B). Immunostains showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for BCL-2 (Fig. 1C) and BCL-6, and negative for cyclin D1. A bone marrow biopsy showed paratrabecular lymphoid aggregates (Fig. 1D). The patient was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. However, the disease relapsed 1 year later requiring further treatment and autologous bone marrow transplantation. She is currently in complete remission.   2.4.2 Case 2 A 68-year-old man had an elevated WBC of 27.8 K/?L on a routine physical examination. Morphological and immunophenotypic studies led to the diagnosis of CLL. He was asymptomatic and managed by observation. Six years later, the patient became symptomatic with respiratory tract infection, WBC of 80 K/?L, and extensive bone marrow disease. He was treated with chemotherapy and achieved partial remission. The disease progressed 6 months later with worsening lymphocytosis and splenomegaly requiring further therapy. He again achieved partial remission but remained asymptomatic with stable counts. He is currently being managed by observation.   2.4.3 Case 3 A 49-year-old woman had a WBC of 21 K/?L detected at time of routine physical examination. After 4 years of observation, the patient was referred to our hospital with a rising WBC count of 190 K/?L, splenomegaly, and extensive bone marrow involvement (Fig. 2A-B). Morphologic and immunophenotypic analysis supported the diagnosis of CLL. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission, but relapsed a year later with marked leukocytosis. She is currently being treated with chemotherapy.   2.4.4 Case 4 A 70-year-old man had an elevated WBC of 17.9 K/?L with 72% lymphocytes. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy and immunophenotypic analysis revealed extensive involvement by CLL. He was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. The disease relapsed 4 years later requiring further treatment. While on therapy, his disease progressed to DLBCL. After failing multiple therapies, the patient died of disease.   "

639,S1879-7296(14)00171-9,Extranodal lymphoma of the head and neck: A 67-case series," 2 Materials and methods Files of all patients presenting with ELHN between January 1st, 2001 and December 31st, 2013 were analyzed retrospectively, excluding intra- and juxta-parotid nodal locations. Definitive diagnosis was histologic. Pathology exams were analyzed according to their code on the ADICAP classification (Association pour le Développement de l’Informatique en Cytologie et en Anatomie Pathologique: Association for the Development of Informatics in Cytology and Anatomo-Pathology), enabling all extranodal locations (excluding code SG: [node]) of the head and neck to be selected: codes AA (amygdala), XF (face), AC (nasopharynx), XC (cervical region), AF (nasal fossae), AS (facial sinus), OE (eye), BX (oral cavity), AL (larynx), BL (tongue) and BP (parotid). The WHO 2009 classification was used for characterizing histologic type: B-cell, T-cell or lymphocytic (LCL) lymphoma or plasmacytoma. B-cell lymphoma was classified as: MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma, small-cell cerebral lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), centroblastic B-cell lymphoma or other low-grade B-cell lymphomas T-cell lymphoma was classified as L angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma or angiocentric T/NK-cell nasal lymphoma. Lymphomas were further classified as aggressive or indolent. DLBCL, Burkitt's and T/NK-cell lymphomas are highly malignant and aggressive. Lymphoma associated with HIV is generally highly malignant. Follicular, low-grade B-cell, brain cell, LCL, MALT lymphomas and plasmacytoma are of low malignancy or indolent. Age at diagnosis, gender, histologic type, location, type of clinical presentation, time interval between symptom onset and histologic diagnosis and known risk factors (HIV-positive status and history of immune disorder) were recorded. The presenting symptom leading to diagnosis was recorded and counted as the clinical presentation. B symptoms and cervical adenopathies were recorded; B symptoms comprise general symptoms: fever, night sweats and weight-loss, associated with both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The specialization (ENT or other) of the physician seen for the presenting symptom leading to diagnosis and of the physician taking the diagnostic sample was recorded in each case. The type of sample enabling histologic diagnosis was classified as surgical specimen (total or partial organ resection) or surgical biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration ahead of diagnostic biopsy was also recorded. All patients underwent local and remote imaging. Fig. 1A and B shows two examples (CT and MRI) of a temporal plasmacytoma and a thyroid lymphoma. The images are not pathology-specific and contrasted with the respective clinical presentations. "

Here we report a case of PPHL in a child who underwent spontaneous regression after failure of salvage chemotherapy. We believe this is the first such case reported in the literature.
645,S2211-0348(17)30332-2,A Case of cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma during treatment of multiple sclerosis with fingolimod," 2 Case description A 69-year-old right-handed female patient suffered an episode of transient left monocular vision loss 25 years ago. She reported that the episode lasted 5min. Approximately 20 years ago she noted diplopia that developed after running three to four miles. This progressed to the point that any significant exercise or exertion would bring about diplopia (Uhthoff's phenomenon). She sought neurological consultation in the year 2000, and was noted to have bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia on exam. Lesions on initial brain MRI were consistent with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Her disease severity remained quite mild over the years, without discrete attacks based on her recollection, but she noted chronic symptoms of extremity spasms treated with baclofen, in addition to slowing of her gait treated with dalfampridine. She also experienced occasional Lhermitte's phenomenon. The patient's local neurologist initiated fingolimod in May 2015. She had an MRI of the brain in May 2015 which did not reveal any new or enhancing lesions ( Fig. 1), and an MRI cervical spine showed multiple stable areas of T2 signal change without enhancement (Fig. 1). The medication was initially well-tolerated; however in April 2016 she noticed a lump on her right posterior neck. The mass was biopsied and found to be consistent with large B-cell lymphoma of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The biopsy revealed large atypical cells that were reactive with CD20, CD30 and MUM-1; these large atypical cells were diffusely Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positive ( Fig. 2). PET scan of the body was negative, and a bone marrow biopsy was negative except for a CLL-like B-cell clone. The patient was diagnosed with an EBV-positive immunosuppressed lymphoproliferative disorder. Exam by one of the authors (CJB) revealed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, left more than right. She scored 10/10 with Ishihara plates bilaterally, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. The discs were flat without pallor. She had spasticity of the left upper extremity and both lower extremities, with an upper motor neuron pattern of weakness which was mild in the left upper extremity and mild to moderate in the left lower extremity. Reflexes were increased in the upper and lower extremities, right more than left, and the plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. She had a spastic gait involving the left more than right lower extremity. Lymphomatous involvement of the CNS was felt to be unlikely, as that patient's exam was stable compared to the local neurologist's exam. Fingolimod was discontinued, and treatment with 4 total doses of rituximab was planned for the lymphoma. Prior to initiating fingolimod, in April 2015, a complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 3900 (reference rage 4300 – 10,500). In October 2015, five months after initiating fingolimod and approximately six months prior to presentation with her neck mass, the patient displayed a worsening leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2900.

657,S1658-3876(13)00041-1,Primary CNS lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: A case report and review of literature," Case report A 53-year-old woman presented to emergency department with a 3–4month history of worsening headaches on left side associated with occasional blurriness of vision and tenderness to touch on left side of her scalp. She denied photophobia, stiffness of neck, fever, nausea or vomiting; there was no variation in symptoms by position or movement. One year prior, she had a cervical discectomy and fusion of C3–C7. Her past medical history included high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. She was a former smoker; her family history was non-contributory. Physical exam did not show any focal neurologic signs, and strength in all the extremities was normal. Non-contrast CT scan of head done in the emergency department was normal. A contrast enhanced MRI showed an extra-axial mass in the left parietal region, with associated effacement of adjacent sulci, which demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement following contrast administration with associated effacement of adjacent sulci. It measured 3.9×1.1cm in maximum transverse dimensions and extended supero-inferiorly for approximately 3.5cm. There was also an enhancing dural tail, and the pattern was found to be most consistent with meningioma. She was discharged with pain medications and shortly thereafter was seen in neurosurgery clinic. Because of her persistent headaches and pain on the left side of the head when she lay down, she underwent a resection of the left parietal mass. Pathology showed that the mass was generally composed of small lymphoid cells with scattered plasmacytoid cells. Mature plasma cells were also noted. Intranuclear inclusions (Russell bodies) were also seen in some of the plasmacytoid cells (Fig. 1 ). This pattern of lymphocytes and plasmacytoid cells with Russell bodies was consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Flow cytometry demonstrated monoclonal B cells that were negative for CD5 and CD10, also consistent with this diagnosis. Her serum immunoglobulin levels were IgG 1220mg/dL, IgM 317mg/dL and IgA 130mg/dL. Her total protein was 6.2 g/dL. Serum protein electrophoresis did not show any distinct paraprotein but immunofixation showed abnormal monoclonal IgM and lambda bands. Her beta microglobulin level was 1mg/L, LDH 131IU/dL. Her hepatitis panel was positive for hepatitis C antibody. A lumbar puncture was done and cerebrospinal fluid showed a total WBC of 2/?l with 4% lymphocytes; cytology was negative for malignant cells and no monoclonal bands were seen on immunofixation. Three weeks after this diagnosis she was admitted with shortness of breath, was found to have a pulmonary embolism, and was started on enoxaparin. A PET CT scan was done to look for other sites of lymphoma but this was negative with no FDG avid lesions to show active lymphoma. A bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed no lymphoma involvement. Bone marrow was negative by flow cytometry and cytogenetics showed normal karyotype. Because of the localized nature of the lymphoma and absence of either malignant cells or monoclonal protein in the CSF, we decided to treat with radiotherapy alone. She was treated with a total dose of 5040 cGy in 40 fractions to the tumor bed. After 1year of follow up, there is no evidence of disease recurrence. "
660,S0090-3019(07)00395-3,Adjacent epidermoid cyst and primary central nervous system lymphoma: case report," 2 Case report A 66-year-old man with a 20-year history of gait disturbance was admitted because of recently worsening symptoms. A few months before admission, the patient began to have severe gait ataxia and dysphagia. He had been diagnosed with brain tumor more than 20 years before, but the details were unknown. Neurologic examination on admission revealed the absence of a left gag reflex and cerebellar ataxia. Laboratory examination of blood and serum showed no abnormalities, including anti-HIV antibody. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass lesion, consisting of a solid core and a cystic part, in the posterior fossa. The brain stem was remarkably compressed. The solid component showed homogenous enhancement after gadolinium administration (Fig. 1A and B ). The cystic component completely occupied the fourth ventricle and appeared as marked hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images (Fig. 1C). Angiography showed a faint tumor blush corresponding to the solid lesion. The preoperative diagnosis was cystic astrocytoma or epidermoid cyst with malignant transformation. A suboccipital craniectomy was performed. Opening of the dura disclosed 2 different tumors (Fig. 2 ). The cystic tumor occupying the fourth ventricle was a pearly white flaky mass, suggesting an epidermoid. The tumor was removed except for the cyst wall adherent to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The left cerebellar tonsil was replaced by a grayish solid tumor. The tumor was not clearly demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue but was totally removed. Histologic examination of the cystic tumor showed keratinous debris circumscribed by epithelial tissue, consistent with the diagnosis of an epidermoid (Fig. 3A). The solid tumor showed a proliferation of large pleomorphic immunoblastic-like cells with widespread necrosis. Mitotic figures and multinucleated giant cells were also found (Fig. 3B and C). Immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumor cells expressed leukocyte common antigen and CD79? (Fig. 3D). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Whole body CT and gallium scintigraphy showed no abnormalities. Therefore, the lymphoma was believed to be a primary brain tumor. An in situ hybridization study disclosed that most of the lymphoma cells labeled for EBV-encoded small RNAs (Fig. 3E). In addition, the lymphoma cells showed strong immunoreactivity for EBNA-2, which is an EBV-encoded nuclear protein and essential for growth transformation of B lymphocytes (Fig. 3F). Postoperative MR imaging showed no residual lesion. Despite subsequent radiotherapy with a total dose of 46 Gy, the patient died of tumor recurrence 3 months after the operation. "
661,S2210-2612(15)00167-4,"Confirmation of immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction using surgically obtained, paraffin-embedded samples to diagnose primary palate mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: A case study"," 2 Presentation of case A 64-year-old woman presented to our department for evaluation of an asymptomatic mass on her left hard palate. Intraoral examination revealed a 30×23-mm mass in the left hard palate’s submucosal region with intact overlying mucosal tissue (Fig. 1 a). Computed tomography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were performed. The results showed a homogeneous mass with well-delineated margins and pressure bone resorption of the hard palate (Fig. 1b–e). There were no other oral lesions or lymph node abnormalities. We initially suspected a benign or low-grade malignant tumor, such as pleomorphic adenoma of the left palate, but an incisional biopsy specimen of the lesion did not confirm this or any other diagnosis. Histological findings revealed minimal lymphocytic infiltration in the stroma of the minor salivary glands. These findings were insufficient to distinguish between a lymphoproliferative disorder and MALT lymphoma. Therefore, we determined to excise this lesion under general anesthesia. Pre-procedure blood tests revealed no unusual hematological or biochemical data. As the correlation of MALT lymphoma with Sjögren’s syndrome is widely reported [1,2,4], we measured the amount of secreted saliva and performed appropriate immunological tests. The patient had normal salivary secretion ability, and had normal ranges of SS-A/Ro antibody and SS-B/Ro antibody. The intraoperative rapid diagnosis of the lesion strongly suggested MALT lymphoma. The tumor was resected with an adequate safety margin of 5mm and the palatal bone touching the tumor was shaved off along with the bone bar (Fig. 2 a, b). The palatal mucosal defect was reconstructed using artificial dermis (Terudermis®). At a follow-up examination 9 months later, no recurrence or metastasis was seen (data not shown). An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy failed to detect Helicobacter pylori or any other abnormal endoscopic findings. Histopathological examination showed lymphocytic infiltrate between the lymphoid follicles. Hyperplasia was seen from the germinal center to the stroma under an oral squamous epithelium surface. This hyperplastic tissue was largely composed of centrocytes and centroblasts with infiltration of small lymphocyte-like cells (Fig. 2c, d). Particularly in the infiltrated area, the lymphoid follicle was irregularly expanded with irregular polarity. Small and medium lymphocyte-like cells and plasma cell-like cells were clustered relatively densely between the follicles. Lymphoepithelial lesions or Dutcher bodies were not observed in the fibrous tissue partitions and salivary gland tissues (Fig. 2c, d). Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for CD20 (Fig. 2e) and CD79a between the lymphoid follicles. CD10 and bcl-2 positivity were observed only in the germinal center cells and nongerminal center cells, respectively. CD3 (Fig. 2f) and CD5 positivity were observed in the T-lymphocytes between follicles. Since CD138, Ig?, and Ig? were positive in some cells, we assumed no immunoglobulin light chain restriction. A few plasma cells between lymphoid follicles were positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 (<40%). In addition, the positive Ki-67 ratio in cells between follicles was about 10%. Based on these histological results, MALT lymphoma was strongly suspected; however, the diagnosis was atypical follicular and interfollicular hyperplasia because of the lack of tumor cell clonality (Fig. 2). Finally, we ordered a molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chains using the FFPE sections of a postoperative sample. We performed PCR using extracted DNA from the materials and observed a monoclonal peak of VH(FR1)/JH, VH(FR2)/JH, and VH(FR3)/JH immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement on capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 3 ). The final diagnosis was MALT lymphoma of the hard palate. "

A superficial lymph node was not palpated. On rectal examination, an elastic, hard tumor with an irregular surface was felt in the direction of 3:00. Complete blood count was within normal limits with hemoglobin of 12.3g/dl. Laboratory examination showed a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 186IU/L and a soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level of 2000U/ml. His stool specimen was positive for hemoglobin. On colonoscopic examination, hemorrhagic submucosal tumor lesions were observed along the rectum from the anus (Fig. 1 ). Histopathological examination of rectal biopsy specimens showed monotonous proliferation of small to medium-sized B lymphocytes but lymphoepithelial lesions (LEL) were not observed. Upon immunohistochemical staining, the proliferating cells were phenotypically characterized to be CD3?, CD20+, CD5?, CD10?, and cyclin D1?. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having MALT lymphoma. The patient was negative for the AP12-MALT1 fusion gene by RT-PCR. CT with heterogeneous contrast enhancement showed a solid tumor of 10cm×10cm in the pelvis. On MRI examination, a low signal was shown in T1-weighted images, and the T2-weighted images showed characteristics of the lesion which developed a heterogeneous low signal. The patient was found to have stage IEA disease and low risk according to the international prognostic index (IPI). The urea expiration test and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-IgG antibody were negative. We attempted to eradicate H. pylori with a 14-day course of a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole) plus combination antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin). Irradiation (total 40Gy) was concurrently performed because tumor diameter was long. He achieved CR, has been disease-free for 24 months, and is currently alive. "

After treatment PET CT showed disease progression in mediastinum and vertebral spine and she received treatment with high dose chemotherapy (HDC) with DHAP regimen 2 cycles and 2 cycles of DexaBEAM regimen. Post HDC PET CT scan showed significant regression of tumor mass in mediastinum. BEAM conditioning and auto transplant was performed. HLA DNA typing analysis of her family revealed no family donor. PET CT within 3 months after auto PBSCT showed positivity of mediastinal mass and therefor patient received 4 cycles of Brentuximab vendotin and achieved complete remission (CR). But, secondary MDS was diagnosed one year after autologous SCT. Patient received ATG BuCy conditioning and unrelated stem cell transplantation during September 2016. She experienced no signs of GVHD and satisfactory post transplant period. During March/April 2017 control PET CT revealed relapse of Hodgkin disease. Now she is receiving treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. Her blood counts are still normal. "
680,S1934-1482(17)31160-7,"Poster 424: Chronic Pain Confusion: Lymphoma Originally Diagnosed as CRPS, A Case Report"," Case/Program Description A 48-year-old woman presented with right ankle pain and swelling several months following a distal fibula fracture due to a fall. The fracture was treated non-operatively and she initially recovered, but then developed pain, hypersensitivity and swelling 7-8 weeks later. She also developed atraumatic left knee pain and swelling. A CT scan showed a lucent lesion in the distal fibula and a bone scan showed increased uptake in the distal fibula, thought to be from trauma. However, uptake was also seen in her left knee and bilateral elbows. At the time, she was diagnosed with CRPS. A pain specialist thought she did not have CRPS and referred her to rheumatology. The rheumatologist performed a left knee arthrocentesis that revealed atypical cells and led to a diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma. She was referred to Orthopedic Oncology. "
681,S0090-3019(07)00636-2,Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and large B-cell central nervous system lymphoma: a case report," 2 Case report  2.1 History and examination The patient was a 73-year-old woman, with no known neurologic history, who initially presented to an outside hospital after an episode of loss of consciousness followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Neurologic examination revealed that the patient was mildly disoriented but had no other deficits. On MRI (Figs. 1-2  ), 2 enhancing masses were noticed: a 4 × 2–cm lesion in the left parietal lobe and a 4 × 3–cm lesion in the left posterior temporal lobe. Both demonstrated associated surrounding edema. A biopsy of the parietal lesion performed at the outside hospital was nondiagnostic. Furthermore, the tissue from a bone marrow biopsy done as part of the work-up at an outside facility was available for review. It demonstrated changes consistent with WM. The decision to proceed with a second brain lesion biopsy to identify the nature of the lesions was made. The patient was taken to the operating room, and the left parietal incision was reopened; a previous burr hole craniectomy site was identified, and using a pituitary forceps, 8 biopsy specimens were taken from a deeper location than in the previous attempted biopsy.   2.2 Histologic features Microscopically, the brain tumor tissue consisted of dense, diffuse and monomorphic large atypical lymphoid cells (Fig. 3 ). Many mitotic figures were seen. The cells contained a small amount of cytoplasm, and the nuclei demonstrated multiple nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was CD20- and BCL2-positive (Figs. 4-5  ). It was negative for CD5, immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, IgD, and IgM. Ki67 was positive in 30% of the cells. The bone marrow aspiration revealed multiple atypical lymphoid cells consisting of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and lymphoplasmacytic cells; all hematopoietic components were present. Immunohistochemistry stains were positive for CD20, CD138, and IgM, and negative for BCL-2 and Bc 16.   2.3 Clinical course To address the intracerebral lymphoma, the patient initially underwent 2 cycles of MTX. She tolerated this well and improved in overall functional status, being able to walk with a walker, plus great improvement in her mental capabilities. A repeated MRI at that time demonstrated that there was a reduction in size of both intracranial lesions (Figs. 6-7  ). Unfortunately, a severe pneumonia after the third cycle of MTX prevented the administration of further cycles. A month later, she presented with altered mental status, and an MRI demonstrated increased size and enhancement of the lesions. She died 3 months after the definitive surgical biopsy procedure.  "
683,S1571-4675(07)00023-5,Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the larynx: A case report with MR imaging findings," 2 Case report A 64-year-old man presented with 1-year history of hoarseness. Clinical examination revealed the presence of a right supraglottic submucosal mass. The patient was then referred to our department of head and neck surgery for cross-sectional imaging. It was difficult to define the tumor extension by laryngoscopy because of its submucosal location. The findings on physical examination were normal, and there was no history of fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Laboratory data were within the normal range. The patient had a history of percutaneous transarterial coronary angioplasty for angina pectoris at age 47 years old. He also had a smoking history of 1 pack per day for over forty years and he consumed alcohol every day. MR imaging was performed using a 1.5T MR unit (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a head–neck coil, initially with recording of spin-echo T1-weighted (TR/TE 550/8.5) and T2-weighted (TR/TE 5000/115) images (Fig. 1A and B). Next, contrast enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images (Fig. 1C) were obtained immediately after intravenous bolus injection of 0.2mmol/kg gadopentate dimeglumine. MR imaging revealed a bulky mass in the right supraglottis that extended to the glottis and aryepiglottic folds. Subglottic extension was also noted, but the epiglottis was preserved. Both shifting and stenosis of the laryngeal lumen were seen, but tumor extension to the anterior commissure was not apparent; this was questionable on subsequent contrast-enhanced CT image. Also, no invasion of the laryngeal cartilage, muscle, and subcutaneous tissue was seen. Low and homogeneous signal intensities were observed in both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, and there was prominent homogeneous enhancement of the tumor signal intensity after gadolinium administration. The patient underwent excisional biopsy with laryngeal microsurgery. Histopathological examination of the specimen showed diffuse infiltration of the small lymphoid cells in the submucosal layer of the larynx. Immunohistological staining showed that the lymphocytes were B-cells (CD20+, CD19+, L26+). Monoclonality of the kappa light chain was also noted, and a diagnosis of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT was made. After the biopsy, whole body FDG PET-CT showed mild uptake in the right larynx, but no other tissue involvement was noted. The patient was treated with multi-agent chemotherapy including rituxan, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (R-CHOP), and he is currently alive and continuing to receive therapy. "
686,S2352-5126(15)00086-7,An unusual case of cytotoxic peripheral T-cell lymphoma," Case report A 69-year-old white man had annular plaques on sun-exposed areas of his body. Two lesional biopsies found a lymphocytic infiltrate lacking atypia and monoclonality. Diffuse dermal mucin deposition was observed, consistent with tumid lupus. The patient was treated with topical fluocinonide cream and hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg daily, later increased to 600 mg, with significant improvement. Three months later skin lesions of a different morphology developed: nodules on his upper arms and thighs that enlarged and involuted spontaneously. Lesional biopsies of the right arm and right leg found an atypical population of CD3+, CD56+, and CD4/CD8 double negative (DN) lymphocytes of medium to large size, consistent with CTCL. Hydroxychloroquine was discontinued, and the patient's nodules resolved. When the patient presented to us, he had a 1-cm ill-defined indurated nodule on his back, an arcuate lesion on his upper abdomen, and several erythematous patches in sun-exposed areas. A biopsy of the nodule found a predominantly CD3+ infiltrate with a normal CD4:CD8 ratio, preserved CD7 expression, and negative CD30 and CD56 expression. There was a mild increase in dermal mucin, consistent with the original diagnosis of tumid lupus. A repeat biopsy 2 weeks later showed only perifollicular granulomatous inflammation. Bone marrow biopsy, peripheral blood flow cytometry, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan were within normal limits. At follow-up 6 months later, the patient remained free of all lesions suggestive of lymphoma. Two years later, the patient returned with new violaceous annular plaques on the left popliteal fossa, right forearm, and the left thigh (Fig 1, A ). He was treated unsuccessfully for 2 months with 0.05% fluocinonide cream. A biopsy of the left popliteal fossa found an atypical dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with focal epidermotropism. The cells were CD3+, CD56+, CD30?, and CD4/CD8 DN by immunohistochemistry (Fig 2 , A-C). TIA1 and granzyme B were positive, and Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small RNAs (EBER) by in situ hybridization were negative. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement studies showed ?F1+ and TCR??. PET/CT and peripheral blood flow cytometry were again unremarkable. The lesions responded to 8 Gy of local electron beam radiation (Fig 1, B). Five months later, the patient had new lesions on his forearms and left thigh. The patient was treated again with local electron beam, with near-complete response to therapy. "
688,S1571-4675(08)00038-2,Primary lymphoma of the skull base Report of two cases," 2 Patients  2.1 Case 1 A 54 years old man with persistent headaches for 3 months presented to our Department complaining of sudden onset of double vision. Personal medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, only a right sixth nerve impairment was detected with no other significant findings. Laboratory tests, including haematological results, were normal. Head CT revealed an expansive clival lesion extending towards the right petrous apex with extensive bone destruction. On MRI the mass lesion showed low signal intensity on T1W images, high irregular signal intensity on T2W images, and intense enhancement after Gadolinium administration (Fig. 1a and b). The presumptive diagnosis was chondrosarcoma. A biopsy was considered as the first modality treatment for the lesion presented at the central skull base. The patient underwent navigated trans sphenoidal tissue biopsy and partial resection of the clival tumour part. Pathology revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The further clinical course was uneventful. The neurological deficit remained unchanged. Other systemic manifestations of the disease were not found. Whole body CT scan and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) did not detect any systemic manifestations of the disease. The patient received 6 cycles of CEOP (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemo therapy, supplementary followed by whole head radiotherapy (30Gy) CT and MRI investigations 3 months after the conclusion of the entire treatment showed a considerable reduction of the mass lesion On clinical examination a satisfactory recovery of the 6th nerve impairment was demonstrated. On further CT and MR studies conducted 9 months later, the lesion remained unchanged. On metastatic work-up there was no evidence of local or systemic metastatic involvement during 1 year of follow-up observations.   2.2 Case 2 A 61 years old woman was referred to our Hospital because of sudden onset of left facial nerve palsy, which was soon followed by severe headaches. Four months before admission she complained of left ear fullness, and she was unsuccessfully treated as left otitis media elsewhere. On admission, the patient showed an isolated left peripheral facial nerve deficit. Laboratory studies showed only a slight increase of C-reactive protein level (0.51mg/dl—normal value <0.30mg/dl) CT scan detected a lesion destroying the left temporal bone with involvement of the mastoid air cells and the middle ear. On MRI the mass appeared hypointense on T1W and hyperintense on T2W, and exhibited intense enhancement after Gadolinium (Fig. 2a and b). An audiogram detected a combined hearing loss in the left ear. Both clinical course and radiological findings suggested the presence of a destructive mass lesion. Thus, an open biopsy was decided prior to a final decision of treatment modality. Biopsy specimen of the lesion revealed diffuse histiocytic large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Staging work-up did not reveal any further lesions. The patient tolerated well the biopsy and underwent six cycles of CEOP systemic chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant local radiation therapy (40Gy). A head CT scan obtained 7 months after the completion of the therapy showed resolution of the left temporal bone lesion. The facial palsy was noticeably improved. The patient remains in remission 8 months after the initial diagnosis.  "
690,S0196-0709(13)00102-6,Tracheal invasion and perforation from advanced primary thyroid lymphoma: A case report and literature review," 2 Case report An 80 year old female presented in the office with a one month history of diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland and a left-sided neck mass. An FNA was performed that was suggestive of lymphoma and a subsequent excisional biopsy showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma. While awaiting treatment, the patient presented to the emergency room with acutely worsening hoarseness and shortness of breath. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed mobile true vocal folds. Her shortness of breath worsened and she was intubated with a 5.0 endotracheal tube as attempts to pass larger tubes through the subglottis were unsuccessful. CT imaging of the neck showed diffuse heterogeneous enlargement of the thyroid gland with significant airway compression (Fig. 1 ). No direct invasion or defect of the trachea was noted at this time. The patient remained intubated and was started on a modified R-CVP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide with 25% dose reduction, Vincristine, and solumedrol) chemotherapy regimen. By the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction in the size and firmness of the patient’s neck mass. The decision was made to extubate the patient but the patient quickly developed respiratory distress requiring reintubation, and a second cycle of chemotherapy was initiated. During the course of the second cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed increased airway pressure and ventilation became more difficult. Fiberoptic examination through the endotracheal tube revealed tissue obstructing the distal end of the tube. The endotracheal tube was withdrawn slightly, revealing a patent tracheal lumen with an intraluminal irregularity or mass identified in the more distal trachea. Peak pressures and oxygen saturation improved with repositioning of the endotracheal tube. A CT neck was performed (Fig. 2 ) that showed a large tracheal defect at the level of the thoracic inlet and the endotracheal tube extending 10 mm into the defect. There was pneumomediastinum, a small left anterior pneumothorax, and extensive paratracheal air. The patient was taken to the operating room and a rigid bronchoscopy revealed a large defect in the anterior tracheal wall between the third and 11th tracheal rings (Fig. 3 ) connecting to a large defect in the soft tissue of the anterior neck where the lymphoma had initially presented. The endotracheal tube was passed through the defect and into the normal trachea distal to the defect, secured in place, and the patient was returned to the ICU. Sedation was titrated to prevent agitation and manipulation of the endotracheal tube was avoided. The patient was successfully extubated 3 days later. The patient’s respiratory status remained stable and chemotherapy was continued through the end of the second cycle. The tracheal defect was managed expectantly and no reconstruction was performed. The patient continued to improve clinically and was ultimately discharged from the hospital on hospital day 44. Upon follow up in our clinic, she was without respiratory complaints but was now noted to have decreased adduction of the vocal cords but an otherwise patent upper airway. She was brought back to the operating room one month later for follow-up bronchoscopic evaluation of her airway, which revealed short segment tracheal stenosis caused by fibrotic tissue at the site of the perforation (Fig. 4 ). The stenotic area was dilated with a 15mm vascular angiocatheter balloon after CO2 laser division of scar tissue. The anterior tracheal wall defect was seen to be mucosalized. The patient tolerated this procedure well and her respiratory status remained stable post-operatively. "
693,S0303-8467(08)00128-5,Primary leptomeningeal B-cell lymphoma of MALT-type in statu nascendi: A case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report  2.1 Clinical history The brain of a deceased 29-year-old Caucasian female was sent to our institution within the framework of the Stanley Medical Research Institute Brain Banking System for major mental illnesses [4]. The patient had been almost totally blind since birth due to retinal dysplasia. She had a long history of insomnia and panic attacks without agoraphobia. At age 28, she presented with an onset of mixed bipolar symptoms with depressed mood, irritability, decreased appetite, sleep disturbance and agitation. During a brief hospitalization, the patient also exhibited definite symptoms of paranoia. She was tried on many antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics. At the time of death, she was prescribed diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. No neurological signs and symptoms were noted in her clinical records. Her psychiatric diagnoses following the DSM-IV system were bipolar disorder, mixed, moderate with psychotic features (DM-IV 296.64) and panic disorder without agoraphobia (DSM-IV 300.01). The patient was found dead laying on her right side in the bed by her roommate. There were no indications of external injuries. The autopsy did not reveal any significant specific pathologic findings. The cause of death was given by the medical examiner as acute combined toxicity of drugs (promethazine, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, temazepam, hydrocodone, diphenhydramine, meprobamate, and carisoprodol), all found in her blood on postmortem toxicologic analysis.   2.2 Material and methods Following the SMRI brain banking protocol, one hemisphere, the entire brainstem and the cerebellum were cut into several 1–1.5cm thick slices, then frozen in a 50/50 mixture of dry ice and isopentane. The other hemisphere was fixed in formalin, which was subsequently subjected to a thorough neuropathological examination. In adherence with the protocol, specimens from the frontal, temporal, and occipital poles as well as the upper cerebellar vermis were taken for histopathologic examination. Additional specimens including the frontal lobe, superior parietal lobe, temporal lobe including the hippocampus and occipital lobe were subsequently taken and examined. The examination included standard histological stains, i.e. hematoxylin and eosin, Cresyl violet (Nissl stain) and luxol-fast blue (LFB) (Klüver–Barrera). The lesion apparent in the leptomeninges of the cerebellum was immunohistochemically examined using antibodies purchased from DAKOCytomation, Carpenteria (USA): ready to use antibodies included: CD20, CD79a, CD3, CD5, Ki-67, cyclin D1. The other antibodies were used at the following dilutions: CD23 (1:5), CD30 (1:20), CD10 (1:25), CD34 (1:50), CD38 (1:50), Bcl-2 (1:5), BCL6 (1:10), pancytokeratin AE1/AE3 (1:50), synaptophysin (1:15), S100A1 (1:800).   2.3 Pathologic findings The fresh unfixed brain weighed 1233g and showed moderate signs of edema and increased intracranial pressure. The leptomeninges were translucent while the leptomeningeal vessels were partly congested. The vessels at the base of the brain (circle of Willis, basilar and vertebral arteries) were thin and delicate. The external configuration of the cerebral gyri showed gyrification abnormalities in the frontal and temporal lobes. No contusions or mass lesions were present. On histological examination, the specimens from the frontal, temporal and occipital poles showed moderate signs of congestion and edema. The neurons of the cortical ribbon showed severe hypoxic changes. A diffuse moderate to severe hyalinosis of the cerebral vessels was noted predominantly in the temporal and occipital lobes. The histopathological examination of the cerebellum disclosed, within the leptomeninges, a circumscribed tumor manifestation (size: 1mm×2mm) composed of heterogeneous small B cells (CD 20- and CD79a-positive) including centrocyte-like cells, few small lymphocytes and rare immunoblast-like cells (Fig. 1 ). The immunohistochemical staining yielded the following result: immunopositive for CD20, CD79a, Bcl-2, and Ki-67 (the latter in <10% of cells); immunonegative for pancytokeratin, S100A1, CD23, CD3, CD30, CD10, CD5, cyclin D1, CD34, and CD38 (Fig. 1). As the lesion was quite small, there were no more slides left containing the tumor tissue for further evaluation of kappa and lambda light chains. Specimens from the adjacent, overlying dura were also analysed but did not show any signs of tumor manifestation. The neuropathological diagnosis of primary leptomeningeal B-cell lymphoma of MALT-type was rendered. Due to the small size of the lesion and the absence of clinical and imaging evidence, we considered the lesion to be in statu nascendi.  "

Right upper trapezius muscle atrophy was noted with allodynia and hyperesthesia over the upper shoulder and lateral neck. Nerve conduction study and electromyography (NCV/EMG) revealed axonal injury over right spinal accessory nerve. Ultrasound revealed swollen supraclavicular nerve, transverse cervical nerve and greater auricular nerve, and the accessory nerve was encased inside the hyperechoic scar tissues. Superficial cervical plexus entrapment and accessory nerve injury were diagnosed. "
696,S2213-0071(15)00012-X,A case of spontaneous regression of pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type lymphoma with Sjögren's syndrome treated with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis," Case report A 72 year-old man with a history of RA, Sjs, and nephrosclerosis was referred to our institution with a cough, sputum, and dyspnea on exertion. He had a smoking history of two packs of cigarettes/day, but he had stopped smoking 20 years ago. He was treated with MTX at a dose of 4 mg/week for six years for treatment of his RA. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple cysts with thin wall, bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities, multiple nodules, and interlobular septal thickening in the middle and lingular segments (Fig. 1 A). Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) testing for bacterial, viral, fungal, and mycobacterial infections were negative. There were no atypical cells in the BAL fluid. BAL cell analysis revealed that a subset of lymphocytes was elevated (% lymphocytes = 47.8%) and that the patient had CD8+-predominant lymphocytic alveolitis (% CD4:CD8 = 0.52). With a presumptive diagnosis of a MTX-related lung complication, MTX was discontinued. To reach a definite diagnosis, video assisted thoracic surgery was performed and samples were taken from S5 and S8 of the right lung. Histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemistry led to the diagnosis of an extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the MALT-type (Fig. 2 ). No metastasis was detected by bone marrow aspiration or CT scans evaluating from neck to pelvis, and gastroscopy was negative. Interestingly, the multiple ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening that were observed on CT images underwent spontaneous regression six months after the discontinuation of MTX (Fig. 1B). To date, he remains in complete remission, and his rheumatoid symptoms are well controlled with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. "
700,S0344-0338(07)00136-7,Renal cell carcinoma with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma infiltration: A case report," Case presentation A 77-year-old male patient had a 3.5-cm-diameter lymph node located in the jugulodigastric area that was removed; on histopathological examination, small atypical lymphoid cells that were positive for B-cell (CD20) immunostaining were observed infiltrating into the lymph node, and the case was reported as small lymphocytic lymphoma (Fig. 1 ). The patient was followed-up without treatment, but had a nephrectomy for a renal mass 5 months later. On gross pathology, the kidney measured 13.0×7.0×4.5cm in size; a yellow-orange mass, measuring 5.8×4.5×4.0cm, was seen infiltrating the renal capsule and pelvis. On histopathological examination, the mass was diagnosed as a grade III renal cell carcinoma. A small lymphocytic lymphoma that was positive for B-cells (CD20) was seen in the renal cell carcinoma area and in the normal renal parenchyma that was not infiltrated by carcinoma (Fig. 2A–C ). "
709,S0344-0338(07)00281-6,Synchronous primary gastric mantle cell lymphoma and early gastric carcinoma: A case report," Case report A 64-year-old male with a history of chronic hepatitis B viral infection was found to have an elevated lesion in the cardia on a routine endoscopic examination. Histologically, it was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Upon hematological evaluation, the patient's white blood cell count was 3640/l (neutrophils 52.5%, lymphocytes 34.6%, monocytes 6.4%, eosinophils 1.9%, and basophils 0.5%), platelet count was 195,000/l, hemoglobin level was 11.4g/dl, and hematocrit level was 33.5%, altogether suggesting mild anemia. Serologically, positive results for HBs–Ag, HBe–Ab, and HBc–Ab IgG, but negative results for HBs–Ab and HBe–Ag were obtained, thereby suggesting chronic B viral hepatitis. The patient's aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were 27 and 17U/l, respectively, and showed no temporal activity. The patient's alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was within the normal range at 36U/l. However, the patient's lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was slightly increased to 268U/l. Abdominal sonography revealed no abnormality, and a total gastrectomy was subsequently performed. Upon gross examination, a slightly elevated lesion was observed in the cardia measuring 1.5×1cm with an additional elevated lesion in the pylorus measuring 1.2×1cm (Fig. 1 ). Microscopic examination identified the cardiac lesion as a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma of EGC type IIa (Fig. 2A and B ), while the pyloric lesion was thought to be a lymphoma confined to the submucosa that was not associated with the EGC found in the cardia. Microscopically, the atypical lymphocytes formed a relatively well-demarcated mass in the submucosa, showing discontinuity of the gastric glands (Fig. 2C). The tumor cells were mostly small- to medium-sized, atypical lymphocytes with irregularly indented nuclei, moderately coarse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant cytoplasms (Fig. 2D). On immunohistochemical stains, the tumor cells showed strong positivity for cyclin D1 (1:50, Neomarker, USA), positivity for CD20 (1:100, DAKO, Denmark) and bcl-2 (1:50, DAKO, Denmark), and weak positivity for CD5 (1:50, Novocastra, UK). However, negative results were observed for CD3 (1:100, DAKO, Denmark), CD10 (1:30, Neomarker, USA), bcl-6 (1:20, DAKO, Denmark), kappa light chain (1:100, Neomarker, USA), and lambda light chain (1:50, DAKO, Denmark) (Fig. 3 ). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a (11;14)(q13;q32) translocation was performed to confirm the MCL (LSI IGH/CCND1-XT, Vysis, IL, USA). The FISH results showed two distinctive signals and one fused signal in each tumor cell, thus indicating the translocation of IgH and Cyclin D1 loci (Fig. 3F) and confirming that the pyloric lesion was an MCL. The EGC in the cardia showed moderate lymphatic invasions in the submucosa. However, there was no evidence of tumor extension in any of the 57 regional lymph nodes present in the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach. Furthermore, there was no suspicious finding of MCL in those lymph nodes or the spleen. Through a thorough histologic examination of the remaining part of the stomach, it was determined to be largely free of any lesion. A pre-operative Tc-99m bone scan showed no abnormality, and the patient was not treated with post-operative chemotherapy. One month after the operation, a bone marrow biopsy was performed and revealed no tumor infiltration. An abdomino-pelvic computed tomography scan and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) were performed 5 months after the operation, and demonstrated no other primary sites or residual tumor presence. Moreover, the ?2-microglobulin level was within the normal range. "
721,S2213-2945(14)00473-6,HHV8-negative effusion based lymphoma: a series of 17 cases at a single institution," Materials and methods Consecutive cases of large-cell lymphoma involving an effusion were retrieved from our pathology database. After all cases that were HHV8+ and/or had a prior or subsequent diagnosis of large-cell extracavitary lymphoma had been excluded, 17 HHV8- cases remained for study. Only those patients with negative staging studies were included in this series. Patient demographics, history, and outcome were obtained by review of hospital electronic medical records.  Immunohistochemical staining All available slides were reviewed. In addition, each of the 14 available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cell blocks was immunostained for HHV8, CD20, CD10, BCL6, MUM1, MYC, Ki-67, and BCL2 and Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization was performed in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations (Table 1 ). Immunostains and in situ hybridization that had been previously performed were not repeated as part of this study. Those not previously performed were done retrospectively using the antibodies listed in Table 1. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were evaluated jointly by 3 observers (A.U., A.E.W., S.K.) using visual inspection. CD20 and BCL2 were interpreted as positive when staining was observed in >80% and >50% of lymphoma cells, respectively. Proliferation rate (Ki-67) was estimated in increments of 5%. The cases were classified by cell of origin based on the algorithm developed by Hans et al, 6  with CD10, BCL6, and MUM1 interpreted as positive when staining was observed in >30% of cells. MYC was also interpreted as positive when staining was observed in >30% of the lymphoma cells. Any in situ nuclear staining in lymphoma cells was interpreted as EBER–positive. All IHC stains were interpreted in conjunction with appropriate positive and negative control sections, which demonstrated the expected positive and negative reactivity.   Cytogenetic studies All available cytogenetic studies were reviewed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed, as per the manufacturer’s recommendations, using Abbott Molecular (Abbott Park, Ill) probes specific for cMYC on chromosome 8q24, BCL6 on chromosome 3q27, IgH on chromosome 14q32, and BCL2 on 18q21. Positive results for MYC and BCL6 rearrangements were defined as the presence of a split signal for cMYC and BCL6, respectively. Positive results for BCL2 rearrangement was defined by the presence of at least 2 BCL2;IGH fusion signals.  "
723,S0344-0338(07)00029-5,Primary splenic marginal zone lymphoma with florid granulomatous reaction—A case report and review of literature," Clinical history A 45-year-old man was diagnosed to have autoimmune hemolytic anemia in December 2002 and was on steroids and later on azathioprine. Subsequently, he developed azathioprine-induced skin rashes, for which his therapy was discontinued, and he was started on mycophenolate. Although his hemoglobin concentration had increased with these drugs, he had developed progressively increasing spleen during this period. In March 2006, he was admitted for a therapeutic splenectomy. At the time of admission, he was afebrile and icteric. There was no peripheral or intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. He was found to have mild hepatomegaly of 1.5cm and massive splenomegaly of 20cm in size. In March 2006, his hemogram was as follows: hemoglobin – 11.2g%, platelets – 145×109/L, total WBC count – 19.1×109/L with 48% atypical lymphoid cells. Direct Coomb's test was positive. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping results were as follows: CD19 – 81.5%, HLA DR – 86.1%, SmIg – 87.4%, lambda – 84.6%, CD23, CD10- and CD5-negative, which was consistent with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. His lupus anticoagulant was positive at presentation. There was no reversal of serum albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio. His chest X-ray was normal. Abdominal ultrasonography showed massive splenomegaly with enlarged splenic vein without any significant lymphadenopathy. There was no clinical or radiological evidence of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. He was HCV-negative. Therapeutic splenectomy was done. "
724,S0377-1237(13)00175-5,A rare case of leukemic presentation of blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma with isolated splenic involvement: Flowcytometric revelation," Case report A 68-year-old male patient with no known co morbidities presented with complaints of easy fatigability and generalized weakness of one month duration in a private hospital. There was no history of weight loss, fever, night sweats and bone pain. Hemogram showed: Hemoglobin (Hb)-2.4 g/dl, Total Leukocyte Count (TLC) – 2,42,000/cumm, Platelets – 33,000/cumm. He was diagnosed as a case of ALL on the basis of peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination. With presumptive diagnosis of ALL he was admitted to our hospital. At the time of admission, he was afebrile and his vitals were stable. Patient had severe pallor, splenomegaly measuring 8 cm below the left costal margin (Fig. 1 ), mild hepatomegaly (3 cm from right costal margin). No icterus, lymphadenopathy, bony tenderness, subcutaneous nodules was present. Peripheral blood smear was examined by senior haemato-pathologist. Hemogram revealed-Hb – 2.9 g/dl, TLC – 3,36,860/cumm, Platelet – 20,000/cumm. Peripheral blood smears showed atypical cells forming 90% of all the White blood cells (WBCs). Morphologically, these atypical cells are of large size, with high N:C ratio with indented, irregular nuclear contour and dispersed chromatin with prominent nucleoli in few cells (Fig. 2 ). These cells were negative for Myeloperoxidase and Non Specific Esterase. Based on the above-mentioned findings diagnosis of high grade lymphoma with peripheral spill was given and Flowcytometric was done on the peripheral blood in our laboratory. In the flowcytometry, 92.13% of all WBCs were gated. Gating strategy used was FSC vs SSC. Initial panel of markers used included CD19, CD20, CD34, CD3, CD10, CD5 and CD7. These cells were positive for CD19, CD20 and CD5 and negative for CD3, CD10, CD34 and CD7. Based on these findings second panel of antibodies was used which showed, these atypical cells were positive for CD45, CD19, CD20, CD79a, CD5, Bcl-2, Lambda, Anti-IgM, Anti-IgD and cyclin D1 and negative for CD10, CD4, CD8, kappa, CD25, CD38, CD23, CD3, CD34, TdT, Anti-MPO and CD7 (Fig. 3 ). Kappa to Lambda ratio was 1:128, thereby showing lambda restriction. Flowcytometric pattern was of mantle cell lymphoma with leukemic phase. Based on the clinical, peripheral blood morphology and flowcytometric findings final diagnosis of blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma with leukemic presentation was given. Combination chemotherapy using R-CHOP (Rituximab and anthracyline based regimen) was planned. But our patient had a very rapid and aggressive clinical course and died within one month of the diagnosis. "
732,S1067-2516(13)00114-2,Case Report and Review of Primary Bone Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Involving the Calcaneus,"  Histologic Findings In DLBCL, the normal tissue arrangement will be replaced by a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells. Sometimes, a dispersed growth pattern will be seen, in which the neoplastic cells are intimately intermingled with normal tissue constituents (3). Extranodal sites will have permeative growth at the edges, and invasion of the blood vessel walls is common (3). Lymphomas can form discrete nodules that are large in size (3).   Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics Mature B-cells can undergo 2 distinct modifications in the germinal center that alter the B-cell receptors. The first is somatic hypermutation, which entails immunoglobulin variable region mutations that create a population of B-cells with increased or decreased affinity for a particular antigen (1). The second modification is a class switch recombination (1). A class switch recombination changes the immunoglobulin heavy chain class from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE (1). These genetic modifications are responsible for the normal immune response but are also a source of DNA damage that can become pathologic in lymphomas (1). Dysfunction of transcription factors and oncogenes can also cause mutations leading to lymphoma. For example, the B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) gene is a gene that encodes for the BCL6 protein (1). The BCL6 protein is responsible for the repression of many genes involved in the differentiation of plasma cells, cell cycle progression, responses to DNA damage, and cell death (1). Genetic mutations or translocations that occur in B-cell lymphomas, such as DLBCL or Burkitt's lymphoma, cause mutation of the Bcl6 transcription factor gene and prevents it from binding to its DNA domain (1). When BCL6 protein cannot bind to its DNA domain on the mutated B-cell, the mutated cells cannot be “turned off,” and cell proliferation continues. Another mutation that leads to the formation of malignant B-cells is the mutation of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cell (NF-?B) genes. The Bcl2 gene encodes the BCL2 protein that regulates cellular apoptosis; and the NF-?B gene encodes for the NF-?B protein, a transcription factor that regulates DNA transcription. Normal centroblasts lack the antiapoptotic activity of the Bcl2 and the NF-?B pathways; therefore, they are programmed to die (1). Malignant centroblasts avoid cell death by acquiring activating translocations of the Bcl2 gene, which encodes for a dysfunctional protein that prevents apoptosis. Constitutively, activating the NF-?B gene increases cellular transcription (1). The Myc gene encodes the MYC protein, a transcription factor that regulates genes. This gene is also regulated by BCL6 in normal centroblasts. Normal centroblasts have rapidly dividing B-cells with a noncleaved nucleus (1). Mutated Myc genes occur in most centroblasts, but malignant ones increase the expression of the MYC protein to evade inhibition. By evading inhibition, the MYC protein increases cell metabolism and growth (1). DLBCL accounts for 30% to 40% of newly diagnosed lymphomas. Gene expression profiling has divided this type of lymphoma into 3 histologically indistinguishable molecular subtypes (or subgroups): germinal center B-cell (GCB), activated B-cell, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (1–5). GCB lymphoma undergoes somatic hypermutation, and the cells often switch IgH classes. Activated B-cell lymphoma expresses IgM, but most have not undergone class switch recombinations, unlike GCB and other B-cell lymphomas. Also, they contain increased amounts of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (1). AID is a mutation enzyme that causes the proliferation of malignant B-cells. Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma usually presents as a mediastinal mass in young women aged about 30 to 35 years (1). Patients with germinal center B-cell and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas have a greater survival rate than those with activated B-cell lymphoma, even with standard chemotherapy combining cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (CHOP-R) (1).   Immunotyping DLBCL usually express B-cell markers, cluster of differentiation (CD)19, CD20, CD22, CD75, and CD79a. Sometimes, atypical staining with 1 or more genetic markers occurs; such as CD10 in 30%, IgM in 75%, and BCL6 in 80% of cases (1). The proliferative fraction quantitatively analyzes the amount of proliferating cells, which are detected by selectively staining proteins, such as Ki-67. Ki-67 is expressed in the nucleus of cells undergoing cellular proliferation, causing an increase in the proliferative fraction (>40% of neoplastic cells) (1). DLBCL is further divided into its subtypes, germinal center B-cell and activated B-cell lymphoma, with the use of the “Hans classifier” (Fig. 1 ). The genetic markers MUM1, BCL6, and CD10 identify the DLBCL subtypes: GCB and activated B-cell lymphoma. Activated B-cell and GCB lymphoma have extranodal involvement in the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow (1,6,7). Lima et al (5) studied the expression of antigens using immunohistochemical analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization in 63 cases of primary bone DLBCL. CD20 was positive in all cases. According to the Hans classifier, 67% (42 of 63) were classified as the GCB phenotype and 33% (21 if 63) as the non-GBC phenotype. In the GCB group, 8 cases expressed BCL6 alone, 2 expressed CD10 alone, 10 expressed CD10 and BCL6, and 20 expressed CD10, BCL 6, and MUM1. Two cases were positive for CD10, negative for BCL6, and positive for MUM1.   Primary Bone Lymphoma Primary bone lymphoma is defined as a lymphoma limited to the bone or bone marrow without an osseous or a nonosseous localization within 6 months after symptom onset (5,8–12). Primary DLBCL of bone found in the calcaneus is extremely rare. Beal et al (13) studied 82 patients with primary bone DLBCL and examined the locations at which each tumor arose. The femur, pelvis, tibia, and fibula had the greatest areas of involvement, with a rare and infrequent presentation in the small bones of the hands and feet (4). Parker and Jackson (14) originally recognized primary lymphoma of the bone in 1939 as a primary reticulum cell sarcoma of the bone. Primary lymphoma of the bone is extremely rare, accounting for 3% to 7% of all malignant bone tumors (4,14,15) and approximately 4% to 5% of extranodal lymphomas. According to the World Health Organization classification of lymphomas, almost all cases are subtypes of DLBCL (15). In 1 retrospective study by Horsman et al (9), 70.3% of primary bone lymphomas were DLBCL. According to the Anne Arbor criteria for clinical staging, most patients will have stage IE or IIE (3). Primary bone lymphoma mainly occurs in those aged 20 to 50 years; however, the mean age is 45 to 50 years, and it has a slight male predominance (5,7,16–18). The clinical course varies, with survival ranging from days to years. The largest series has shown a 5-year survival rate of 61%, with an increased survival rate in patients younger than 60 years old (9). Patients most commonly present with vague local bone pain, fevers, weight loss, night sweats, soft tissue swelling, and/or pathologic fracture. Patients can wait for months before seeking medical attention. The pelvic bones, long tubular bones (especially the femur), vertebrae, and ribs have been the most common sites.  "

754,S0190-9622(08)00409-X,Onychodystrophy and tumor-stage mycosis fungoides confined to a single digit: Report of a case and review of nail findings in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma," Case report A 78-year-old man presented with onychodystrophy and painless swelling of the right fourth finger. During the preceding few months the nail became thickened and brittle, followed by swelling and erythema of the entire digit. There was no history of trauma. He had been followed up for 8 years for patch- and plaque-stage MF; his current treatment consisted of psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). At the time of examination he had less than 5% body surface area involved. Physical examination revealed onychodystrophy of the right fourth finger nail with nail plate thinning and partial obliteration of the proximal and lateral nailfolds ( Fig 1, A); the other nails demonstrated half-and-half changes. The nails on the left hand and both feet were normal. There was prominent painless soft-tissue swelling of the entire digit, spanning from the distal tip to the metacarpophalangeal joint (Fig 1, B). The skin was erythematous, shiny, and blanchable. There was no synovitis of the distal or proximal joints. Clinically, there was concern about this being an infection with underlying osteomyelitis. Radiograph revealed soft-tissue swelling but no osteomyelitis. A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen, taken from the proximal nail bed, revealed a heavy dermal infiltrate of pleomorphic mononuclear cells ( Fig 2, A). The nuclei were crenated and hyperchromatic (Fig 2, B). Significant epidermal involvement was not seen. T-cell immunoprofiling revealed a marked elevation in CD 4:CD 8 ratio of greater than 10:1. Findings were consistent with tumor-stage MF. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained documenting a 8- × 3- × 1.5-cm tumor along the volar aspect. Radiation of the finger resulted in anonychia and complete resolution of the tumor ( Fig 3). "

Antigen retrieval, antibody detection, and nuclear counterstaining were performed as previously described [7].   2.2 EBER in situ hybridization Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) using an EBER PNA detection kit (DakoCytomation) and fast red counterstaining [7].   2.3 Molecular analysis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for detecting monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH) rearrangement was performed using primers directed against sequences of the framework variable region (FR1-FR2-FR3) and joining region, according to the Biomed-2 protocol [8]. PCR products were analyzed on 4% to 20% gradient polyacrylamide gel stained with ethidium bromide. PCR amplification for detecting monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma (TCR?) rearrangement was performed by heminested PCR, using primers for the variable (Tv?) and joining (Tj?) regions, as previously described [8]. PCR products were analyzed on 4% to 20% gradient polyacrylamide gel stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products were directly sequenced using a commercially available kit (Big Dye Terminator, Version 1.1, Applied Biosystems [Foster City, CA] for case 1 and InVivoScribe Technologies IGH Gene Clonality Assay [San Diego, CA] for case 2).

771,S0022-3468(07)00509-X,A case report of B-cell lymphoma masquerading as superior mesenteric artery syndrome," 1 Case history A previously well, 7-year-old girl developed a chest infection that progressed to a left-sided empyema. This was managed at another center initially with chest tube drainage but subsequently required thoracotomy and decortication. She lost 4 kg in weight during a 3-week period. Three weeks later, she presented to her local hospital with a history of recurrent bilious vomiting, abdominal pain, and upper abdominal distension. Subsequently an upper-gastrointestinal (GI) contrast demonstrated a dilated stomach and duodenum with a sharp vertical cutoff at the third part of the duodenum. A trickle of contrast was seen to pass distally on placing the patient in the left lateral position (Fig. 1 ). The findings were highly suggestive of the SMA syndrome, and it was assumed that the likely cause was cachexia related to her previous illness, surgery, and slow recovery. She was transferred to our hospital for further management. Endoscopic placement of a nasojejunal tube was attempted to permit enteral feeding. This was unsuccessful, and the patient was therefore taken to theater the next day for open placement of a jejunostomy tube. At surgery, she was found to have a large volume of ascitic fluid. The omentum was thickened and abnormal, a fleshy tumor was identified in her pelvis, and there were disseminated peritoneal seedlings. Around 10 cm from the duodenojejunal flexure there was a jejunojejunal intussusception caused by a tumor mass in the bowel wall. In addition, there were significantly enlarged retroperitoneal midline lymph nodes further distorting the duodenal anatomy. There was a clear demarcation at this point indicating the level of the obstruction. The intussusception was irreducible; therefore, a resection with primary anastomosis was undertaken along with sampling of the pelvic tumor and paraaortic lymph nodes. The patient made an uneventful and complete postoperative recovery. Histologic analysis subsequently confirmed high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and she was commenced on chemotherapy to which she responded well and is now currently symptom and disease free. "
774,S0016-5107(07)02866-0,Adult Burkitt-like lymphoma of the colon: a case report and a review of the literature," Case report A 46-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, progressively increasing swelling of the abdomen, constipation, and weight loss of 10 pounds. His physical examination was unremarkable except for a 10-cm mass, with mild tenderness, located approximately in the right lower quadrant. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 9 × 9 cm solid mass in the ascending colon ( Fig. 1). Colonoscopy showed a near-obstructive large fungating polypoid irregular mass with necrotic areas starting just proximally to the hepatic flexure and extending further proximally into the right colon ( Fig. 2). A biopsy of the mass was performed. Because of the obstructive nature of the lesion, the patient had a right hemicolectomy, segmental small-bowel resection, and partial omentectomy. Operative findings revealed a 13 × 11 × 8 cm ileocecal mass, multiple omental nodular infiltrates, and a 2.5 × 2 × 1 cm nodule of the terminal ileum. The pathologic examination of the biopsy specimen and resected materials revealed small atypical lymphocytes of unequal shape and size with round to irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm consistent with the typical “starry sky” appearance of BLL ( Fig. 3). The immunoperoxidase stains were positive for B-cell markers (CD10 and CD20) and negative for T-cell markers (CD3, CD5, and CD23). The cytogenetical analysis revealed proto-oncogene (c-myc) rearrangement. Therefore, the diagnostic criteria of BLL in the GI tract were fulfilled. Staging workup was positive for an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and negative for bone marrow involvement, the cerebrospinal fluid examination showed negative results, and a PET scan showed uptake at the surgery site and in the stomach. The patient underwent 7 cycles of Berlin–Frankfurt–Munster (BFM) chemotherapy and then had autologous bone marrow transplant for relapse. The patient is still alive 5 years after his diagnosis. "
776,S0953-6205(07)00013-1,Hepatosplenic ?? T-cell lymphoma: A case report," 2 Case report In 2002, a 53-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of weight loss, night sweats, and splenomegaly. Several months before admission, the patient had complained of anorexia, fatigue, night sweats, abdominal pain, and weight loss of 30 kg. He had no significant medical history. The patient's abdomen was tender, with an enormous splenomegaly. Superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. The initial hemogram showed hemoglobin 6.5 mmol/L, hematocrit 34%, WBC 2.3/nL with 0.69 neutrophils, 1.27 lymphocytes, 0.16 monocytes, 0.12 eosinophils, 0.00 basophils, and platelets 103/nL. The initial serum chemistries were normal. Computed tomography revealed an enormous (21×11 cm) splenomegaly. A peripheral blood smear showed no atypical lymphocytes. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow with infiltration of atypical CD3+ lymphoid cells within dilated sinuses. A splenectomy was performed. The spleen weighed 3450 g and the general architecture was preserved, but there was a marked hypertrophy of the red pulp. The white pulp was atrophic. The spleen was infiltrated with atypical, monomorphic lymphoma cells in the sinuses of the red pulp (Fig. 1 ). Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD2, CD3, CD52, and TIA-1, and was negative for CD5, CD20, CD22, CD23, and CD79a. Bone marrow chromosomal analysis (karyotype 46, XY) showed no abnormalities among 20 metaphases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed isochromosome arm 7q. Monoclonal rearrangement of the TCR ? gene was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction analysis in the spleen cells. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV ?? hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. The patient received eight cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and prednisone) chemotherapy. Evaluation after eight cycles showed a complete remission, with no residual disease in bone marrow biopsy. Eleven months after completing the CHOP chemotherapy, the patient relapsed. Recurrence of the original malignant clone was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. CT scan revealed a hepatomegaly. Treatment with second-line chemotherapy with DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) showed no response. As cells stained highly positive for CD52, the decision was made to treat the patient with alemtuzumab (MabCampath®). Intravenous alemtuzumab therapy was initiated with dose escalation (from 3 to 30 mg). The target dose (30 mg) was achieved on the 5th day. A total of eleven 30-mg doses were administered. Therapy was discontinued because the patient experienced persistent, serious side effects, including fever, fatigue, and anorexia with deterioration of his physical condition; no signs of response were observed. Six months later, the patient died, 26 months after the onset of the disease. "

Neurological examination was normal. MRI showed multiple mass lesions in both hemispheres (Fig. 1 ). The largest one was located in the right fronto-basal region and compressed the adjacent anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. The other lesions were located periventricular of the left anterior horn, in the mesio-temporal region in both hemispheres with closed contact to the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles and bihemispheric along the insular cortex with contact to the leptomeningeal space. All lesions showed mild hyperintensity but lower than perifocal edema on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences (Fig. 1a and b). They were hypointense on non-enhanced T1-weighted scans and enhanced strongly gadolinium-contrast (Fig. 1c and d). All lesions presented high signal on diffusion-weighted images and low ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values (median ADClesions =74.5×10?7 cm2/s) (Fig. 1e and f). In contrary, the edema surrounding the larger lesions showed slight hypointensity on DWI and increased values on ADC-map (median ADCperifocaledema =185.2×10?7 cm2/s). The patient was transferred to neurosurgery for stereotactic biopsy. Histopathology revealed a diffuse B-cell lymphoma. "

She was in good general condition, showing no signs of dysphagia, dyspnea, night sweating, or fever. Her medical history included hypertension and family history provided no additional information. Physical examination showed a swelling of the submandibular lymph node with 18mm×14mm dimensions; no other lymphadenopathices were observed. Laboratory tests results (Table 1 ), chest X-ray, and electrocardiograph showed no abnormalities. A neck ultrasound revealed a 16mm×12mm solid mass in the left side of the submandibular region. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a questionable mass in the left side of the submandibular region. The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)–CT detected the large left submandibular lymph node with a maximum standardized uptake value of 5.2 (Fig. 1C). Clinical diagnoses of metastatic malignant tumor of unknown origin or malignant lymphoma were made. The lymph node was successfully removed by a minimally invasive procedure with general anesthesia (Fig. 1B). Giemsa chromosome banding stain showed no abnormality (Fig. 1D). A flow cytometry analysis of the lymphoma cells in lymph node showed the following results: CD19(+), CD20(+), CD23(+), and immunoglobulin light chains kappa(+) and lambda(?) (Fig. 2 ). This method was introduced into the investigation of this material on the basis of a primary CD45/side scatter gating procedure. A histopathologic examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of a lymph node specimen showed that the basic architecture of the lymph node had been lost, and a follicle-like architecture which had a predominance of centroblast-like cells were seen. Immunohistochemistry showed: BCL2(?), MUM1(?), CD10(+), and BCL6(+) (Fig. 3 ). A diagnosis of Stage I according to the AnnArbor Staging System, FL without t(14;18)(q32;q21) with a Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) of 1 was made. She was not treated with either chemotherapy or combined chemoradiotherapy regimens and remained disease free, until now, 12 months after the operation in the PET–CT evaluation. "
795,S0090-3019(06)00178-9,Primary malignant B-cell–type dural lymphoma: case report," 2 Case presentation A 59-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of progressively severe frontal headaches. Physical and neurological examinations were negative. MRI studies revealed a bifrontal parasagittal, enhanced tumor, 7.5 (lateral) × 9.5 (anterioposterior) × 2 cm (vertical) along the internal table of the skull. This mass appeared to extend into the right frontal lobe through the dura, which was surrounded by severe cerebral edema (Fig. 1A). Thallium (Tl) accumulation was noted in the tumor by 201Tl-scintigraphy at both early and late phases (Fig. 1B), suggestive of an aggressive tumor. Preoperative angiography revealed complete occlusion of the anterior one third of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), reactive to the tumor invasion (Fig. 1C, note arrowheads). Compensatory enlargement of bridging veins was found in the anterior frontal area bilaterally draining into the sphenoparietal sinuses (Fig. 1C, arrows). Preoperative radiological diagnosis was meningioma with aggressive characters. Subtotal tumor resection was performed under general anesthesia in the following manner. On developing bifrontal craniotomy, a grayish firm epidural tumor was found (Fig. 2A). For the dural tumor excision, the SSS was ligated anterior and posterior to the occlusion (Fig. 1C, dotted arrow). Then, the bilateral dural flaps, falx, and SSS were removed altogether (Fig. 2B). The tumor extending to the skull base dura next to the crista galli was firm, discolored grayish, and poorly demarcated. Therefore, this area was vaporized with a laser vaporizer (PAL-I, Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing Incorporation, Tokyo, Japan). A frontal galea-periosteal flap (11 × 8 cm) was used for dural closure. The free bone flap and titanium plate were combined to complete cranioplasy. Histologically, dense polymorphous lymphoid proliferation and large lymphocytes (HE staining) were found (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemical study with CD20 revealed a specific antibody for B-cell lymphocytes in tumor cell membranes (Fig. 3B). The MIB-1 index was extremely high (35%) (Fig. 3C). These pathological features were compatible with malignant lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell type. No extracranial tumor was identified in further radiological examinations. Three weeks after surgery, systemic chemotherapy began with a combination of methotrexate, cytarabin, ifosfamide, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. The patient has been active postoperatively for 26 months with no neurological deficit. No MRI evidence of tumor recurrence was apparent 30 months after the surgery (Fig. 4 ). "

808,S0046-8177(06)00218-8,Extra-oral plasmablastic lymphoma: report of a case and review of literature," 2 Report of a case A 33-year-old African American man who was recently diagnosed with HIV infection presented with a history of intermittent rectal pain and bleeding for 1 year, and 15% of weight loss within 6 months. At presentation, his HIV viral load was 78400 per milliliter and his absolute CD4 count was 486 per cubic millimeter. He had had several visits to the emergency department of a local hospital and was diagnosed to have hemorrhoids. Each time, he was treated with pain medication and suppositories with some relief. He continued to have pain and discomfort in his perineal area and he had noticed a perianal mass for a month. Colonoscopy performed at an outside institution revealed a firm and exophytic mass in the anal canal with extension to the rectum. Biopsy of the anal mass was reported to have viral inclusions consistent with condyloma accuminatum. However, the slides were not available for review. A subsequent biopsy of the anal mass was performed at our institution. Grossly, it consisted of multiple fragments of brown-tan friable tissue with attached erythematous mucosa. Microscopically, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections showed multiple fragments of anal-type mucosa and soft tissue diffusely infiltrated by large atypical cells with abundant basophilic cytoplasm, eccentrically located nuclei, and single, centrally located prominent nucleoli (Fig. 1A and B). Immunoperoxidase stains showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for CD138, EMA, and CD10 (Fig. 1C and D), weakly positive for CD79a, and focally positive for EBV latent membrane protein (LMP). Proliferation rate as assessed by Ki-67/MIB-1 staining was approximately 70%. In situ hybridization showed immunoglobulin light chain ? restriction and positivity for Epstein-Barr viral early RNA (4/4). These cells were negative for CD3, CD20, CD30, CD45, BCL2, BCL6, PAX5, and ALK-1. Immunostain for human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) was negative. A diagnosis of PBL was made. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and showed a mildly hypercellular marrow infiltrated with scattered plasmablasts morphologically similar to the cells in the tumor mass. Flow cytometry of the marrow aspirate revealed a small population of CD138+ cells that were immunoglobulin light chain ? restricted, confirming the bone marrow involvement by PBL. "
811,S0090-3019(05)00692-0,Secondary central nervous system involvement by follicular lymphoma: case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report A 53-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IV follicular lymphoma, grade 1, in 1996 (Fig. 1 A-D) and initially treated with an unknown number of cycles of CVP chemotherapy. In October 1999, he presented to the University Hospital, Denver, Colo, with cervical lymphadenopathy. A cervical lymph node biopsy was performed that showed follicular lymphoma, grade 1. In September 2000, he developed symptomatic inguinal lymphadenopathy that caused lower extremity edema and paresthesias. He was treated with 4 cycles of CVP for each occurrence of lymphadenopathy, both in 1999 and 2000, with good response. In June 2003, he presented with spinal cord compression with disease at T2-T5 vertebra for which he was treated with emergent radiation therapy, one cycle of CVP and 6 cycles of rituximab, and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and prednisone. In May 2004, a parieto-occipital lobe lesion was identified on MRI, which was treated with whole brain external beam radiation. The lesion regressed but did not disappear. In September 2004, a repeat MRI showed enlargement of the tumor within the parieto-occipital lobe, which now measured up to 4.0 cm in diameter (Fig. 2 A). The lesion was surgically excised. Postoperative MRI scans additionally revealed a paraspinal mass at the T1 level, with epidural extension and extensive cervical and focal thoracic (T1) spine bony involvement. An MRI performed in December 2004 showed significant worsening of the patient's brain lesions. The patient's clinical condition has declined steadily since that time, with loss of the ability to read or complete sentences. He has also become increasingly somnolent and is currently receiving only palliative therapy and supportive care. "
823,S1054-8807(17)30224-7,"Malignant lymphoma arising in cardiac myxoma, presenting with peripheral arterial emboli"," 2 Case report A 44-year-old man presented with abrupt right lower leg pain. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed segmental obstruction of the right common femoral artery (Fig. 1A), and emergency embolectomy was performed. On histological examination, the embolectomy specimen contained several clusters of degenerated round/oval-shaped atypical cells in fibrinous and myxoid areas (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemical examination revealed that these atypical cells were negative for cytokeratin (Fig. 1C), CD31, and S-100. Expression of CD45 was noted; however, it was considered to be a non-specific finding due to the intense background staining (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the diagnosis made was “presence of atypical cells” and we recommended systemic evaluation and follow up. However, the patient refused systemic evaluation. One year after the embolectomy, the patient presented with dyspnea on exertion. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a 5.7×1.9 cm, lobulated, echogenic mass attached to the interatrial septum (Fig. 2A). After excision, a 6.0×3.2×2.0 cm friable mass with irregular surface and focal myxoid texture was observed (Fig. 2B). Microscopically, most of the mass was composed of stellate or curved cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm in the myxoid background. Some of these cells surrounded blood vessels (Fig. 2C), which was a characteristic of cardiac myxoma. However, there were numerous scattered or clustered round/oval-shaped cells (Fig. 2D), similar to those observed in the embolectomy specimen. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that these atypical cells expressed CD45 (Fig. 2E) and CD20 (Fig. 2F), with a Ki-67 labeling index of 90%. MUM1 and Bcl-6 were expressed in 60% of atypical cells; however, Bcl-2 and CD10 were not expressed. Calretinin was expressed in stellate cells, but not in atypical cells (Fig. 2G). In situ hybridization for Epstein–Barr virus encoding RNA (EBER) was positive in atypical cells (Fig. 2H). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with non-germinal center type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) arising in a cardiac myxoma. A retrospective review and additional immunohistochemical analysis of the embolectomy specimen were performed. During the slide review, scattered stellate or curved cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm were observed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that these cells were positive for calretinin, which is consistent with myxoma cells (Fig. 1E). In addition, the atypical cells were positive for CD20 (Fig. 1F) and in situ hybridization for EBER (Fig. 1G). These findings were suggestive of tumor emboli from a cardiac myxoma containing DLBCL cells. After the diagnosis, the patient underwent positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT), and lymphoma involvement was identified in the left lower extremity. The patient subsequently started the first of six cycles of chemotherapy with a protocol of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone. "

On examination her abdomen was distended with a palpable left adnexal mass. Neither liver nor spleen was palpable; no adenopathy was noted. Laboratory examination showed hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dl, total white blood cell count 11800/cumm and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 45 mm at the end of 1 h. The serum tumor markers were negative for CA 125. Chest radiograph was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a solid mass measuring 15×9×6 cm. The mass was behind the uterus, the right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal while left ovary could not be visualized. There was no free fluid, and enlarged lymph nodes were not identified in the abdomen. On November 10, 2003, she underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a 15-cm size irregularly shaped and encapsulated left ovarian mass. The tumor was adherent to sigmoid colon; hence, complete resection of the tumor could not be achieved. The omentum, right ovary and right fallopian tube appeared normal. No other masses or lymphadenopathy were noted. A left salpingooophorectomy was performed and tissue bits of the omentum were collected for histopathological study. The resected specimen of left ovarian tumor comprised of three circumscribed to ovoid masses which totally measured 15×9×6 cm and weighed 750 g. The outer surface of the tumor had smooth appearance with focally raised nodules, while cut surface revealed homogenous grayish white appearance and there was infiltration of the left fallopian tube by the tumor (Fig. 1 ). The microscopic examination consisted of sheets of large lymphoid cells with a moderate amount of pale cytoplasm. The nuclei were round or had irregular nuclear contours, irregularly distributed chromatin, nucleoli, and many mitosis (Fig. 2 ). Microscopic examination confirmed infiltration of the left fallopian tube by tumor cells. The omentum did not show infiltration by tumor cells. Immunohistochemical studies showed features of diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which was positive for LCA and CD 20 while it showed negative results for MPO, CK, ALK-1, CD 43, CD 30, Inhibin and CEA. The assessment of the lymphoma after histopathological diagnosis included the determination of CD4 count (657 cells/ml), CD8 count (1430 cells/ml), viral particles (5600 viral copies/ml) and the computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which did not show extra pelvic disease and no lymphadenopathy. The bone marrow examination did not show deposits of lymphoma. She was advised the combination chemotherapy and HAART. She could not afford above treatment due to financial constraint. Subsequently, at the 6-month follow-up, she presented with abdominal pain and signs of subacute intestinal obstruction and 15 kg weight loss in 6 months. The ultrasonography of abdomen showed a homogenous mass measuring 15×15 cm in left iliac fossa, the mass was adherent to bowel loops. Follow-up sonography showed tumor mass occupying the complete abdominal cavity following which she deteriorated rapidly and died, 7 months after the diagnosis of lymphoma was made. "
834,S0960-7404(06)00067-3,T-cell lymphoma of the upper eyelid: A case report and review of the literature," Case presentation A 95-year-old white female presented to our clinic with a recurrent right upper eyelid lesion (Fig. 1a ). The patient's history dates back to 1998 when she had multiple skin lesions excised which were diagnosed as T-cell lymphoma. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the current lesion by an outside practitioner 2 months before, which was diagnosed as anaplastic large cell. A metastatic workup with CT of the neck, chest, and abdomen was negative for disease. The patient was presented to our multidisciplinary tumor board for further treatment recommendations. At the time of presentation the tumor was causing significant lagophthalmos in her better-seeing eye, which was producing a decrease in the patient's quality of life. Due to the patient's advanced age, risk of blindness as a radiation complication, and local disease, surgical excision of the tumor was considered. After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and her family, she was taken to the operating room for surgical excision of the lesion with reconstruction. A resection of the right eyebrow and upper lid was performed. The resulting defect was approximately 3×2.5cm (Fig. 1b). Reconstruction was accomplished with a frontalis muscle sling (Fig. 1c) and full-thickeness skin graft from the contralateral eyelid. Final pathologic examination of the eyelid tumor showed intermediate-sized polygonal cells with mildly variable oval nuclei containing finely to coarsely reticular chromatic and prominent nucleoli. The cells formed a few sheets and contained discernible amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 2a ). Stains revealed the cells to be positive for CD3 (Fig. 2b), CD45 RO (Fig. 2c), and CD30 (Fig. 2d); negative for CD2, EMA, CD117, bcl-2, and CD79-A. The initial biopsy diagnosis was confirmed as anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. At 1-month follow up the patients visual field deficit had resolved and she was able to close her eye without difficulty (Fig. 1d). There was no evidence of xerophthalmia. At the patient's last clinic visit, 3.5 years following her surgery, she is still symptom free. "
835,S1529-9430(13)01996-7,Aggressive plasmablastic lymphoma of the thoracic spine presenting as acute spinal cord compression in a case of asymptomatic undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus infection," Case report A 33-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of sudden-onset bilateral lower limb weakness and paresthesia from below the level of the umbilicus. The patient reported a 10-day history of thoracic back pain after a minor lifting injury and a 3-day history of constipation and increasing difficulty passing urine. There was no significant medical history, except a nonspecific viral infection 6 years previously, which resolved spontaneously. On examination, she had incomplete lower limb paraplegia (American Spinal Injury Association, Grade C) with reduced sensation from T7 level. She had cervical lymphadenopathy, but otherwise, her examination was normal. Hemoglobin was 8.6 g/dL. Total white cell counts and platelet count were normal, but white cell differential revealed mild lymphopenia. Liver and renal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and chest radiograph were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an extradural mass extending from T3 to T6 within the left posterior canal, resulting in significant cord compression. This mass extended through the exit foramina at the T4 and T5 levels with a small enhancing paraspinal component. Subsequent computed tomography scanning revealed mild cervical and axillary adenopathy. In brief, the patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. A vertical midline incision was used to expose the laminae of T3–T8 bilaterally. Bilateral laminectomies were performed from T3 to T8, followed by a complete debulking of the involved tumor mass. An instrumented posterior thoracic fusion was performed using pedicle screws and two contoured titanium rods. Fluoroscopic images were obtained intraoperatively to confirm the levels involved before laminectomy and to assess the final position of instrumentation. Finally, the wound was closed in standard fashion. Histologic examination of the operative specimen demonstrated tumor cells of PBL with large, eccentrically placed nuclei and abundant basophilic cytoplasm, which was CD45 negative and CD138 and MUM1 oncogene positive (Figure , A–D). A diagnosis of high-grade aggressive PBL was made on the basis of these histologic features. Subsequently, the patient was tested for HIV and found to be positive. Her CD4+ count was 137, indicating advanced immunosuppression or AIDS. Her viral load was 17,800. She was treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) chemotherapy regime containing methotrexate, cytarabine, calcium leucovorin, and G-CSF as well as intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate and cytarabine to prevent recurrence. Darunavir, ritonavir, famciclovir, and abacavir/lamivudine were commenced to manage her retroviral infection. Her lower limb power and sensation improved to American Spinal Injury Association Grade D over the subsequent 2 weeks, and restaging computer tomographic scan showed resolution of both cervical and axillary adenopathies as well as the T5 mass.

850,S0090-3019(06)00368-5,Primary brain T-cell lymphoma after kidney transplantation: a case report," 2 Case description The patient received a living-related kidney transplant when she was 56 after 6 years of end-stage renal disease. The renal allograft functioned well and her serum creatinine level declined from 8.1 to 1.7 mg/dL after transplantation. Without antithymocyte globulins for induction, the patient was prescribed cyclosporin and prednisolone for initial immunosuppression. During follow-up, the patient developed several infections, including urinary tract infections and pneumonia. All these comorbidities resolved after appropriate management. Chronic allograft nephropathy also developed during follow-up, and the serum creatinine level remained roughly 3.0 mg/dL. In serial renal allograft biopsies, neither acute nor chronic rejection has been documented in pathologic studies. Allograft impairment can be attributable to drug-related nephrotoxicity. After adjustment, the patient's maintenance immunosuppressive regimen comprised cyclosporin 50 mg/d, mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg bid, prednisolone 5 mg/d, and rapamune 1 mg/d. About 1 month before her admission, a focal seizure occurred with abnormal twitching of the left side of her mouth and involuntary tilting of her neck. In the subsequent days, these symptoms became increasingly frequent, and her left side also became weak and clumsy. Left central-type facial palsy and leftward deviation of the tongue were also identified. No diplopia, dysphagia, or dysarthria was noted, nor did the patient have fever, neck stiffness, or headache. There were no palpable lymphadenopathies. Cerebrospinal fluid examination did not identify positive bacterial or viral isolations. The protein levels and cell counts of the cerebrospinal fluid were not elevated. The T1-weighted MR imaging revealed a hypointense and heterogeneously enhanced mass located along the gyrus at the right frontal region (Fig. 1A). This lesion, measuring 5 × 5 × 4 cm, was surrounded by significantly perifocal edema (Fig. 1B). Another small lesion was also found at the left precentral gyrus. A proton MR spectroscopy study showed that lactate and lipid level were moderately increased. All other metabolites were preserved; however, choline was significantly elevated and was substantially higher than N-acetyl aspartate and creatine (Fig. 1C,D). Clinically, osmotherapy and steroids were administered for symptomatic relief. When doses of both medications were reduced, focal neurologic signs soon reappeared. To generate tissue proof of the mass, the patient first underwent a biopsy but the result was inconclusive. Two weeks later, the patient underwent total tumor excision via a right frontoparietal craniotomy. Pathologically, it showed dense perivascular and parenchymal infiltration of atypical mononuclear cells (Fig. 2A). Imprint cytology revealed that these atypical cells were small to medium in size, with frequent angular nuclear contour (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemically, these tumor cells were positive for T-cell marker (CD3) (Fig. 2C), but were negative for B-cell (CD20) and natural killer cell marker (CD56). In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus small nuclear RNA was negative. With the combined pathologic finding and clinical history, a PTLD of monomorphic T-cell phenotype was confirmed. A thoroughly postoperative systemic evaluation, comprising a thoracoabdominal computed tomography scan and bone marrow biopsy, did not identify other organ involvement. Therefore, immunosuppressant dosages were reduced, and a combination of carmustine, oncovin, and methylprednisolone was administered for chemotherapy. The patient's neurologic status, however, continued to deteriorate, and neutropenia developed. One month after chemotherapy, the patient died of septic shock. "

861,S0344-0338(05)00212-8,Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the uterine cervix mimicking leiomyoma: Case report and review of the literature," Case report The patient was a 43-year-old, gravida 2, para 2, normally menstruating woman, who was referred to the 2nd Department of Gynecology, Lublin University School of Medicine, Lublin, Poland, for surgical resection of leiomyoma in the uterine cervix. Previously, she had undergone the routine Pap smear test, which revealed normal values. A tumor approximately 10cm in diameter was palpable in the uterine cervix. Grossly, the uterine corpus, fallopian tubes, and both ovaries were normal, and there was no lymph node involvement on physical examination. The patient and her family had no history of neoplastic diseases in the past. Ultrasonographic examination revealed a cervical tumor 95×88mm in diameter, with no abnormalities in other female genital tract organs. Clinical work-up consisted of chest radiography, blood and chemistry profiles, and serology for hepatitis B and C. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest provided no evidence of disease. She underwent surgery (total abdominal hysterectomy), and post-surgical histological assessment revealed a primary high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the uterine cervix, stage IE according to the Ann Arbor Staging Classification for Lymphoma [13]. The patient was referred to the Department of Oncology, Lublin University School of Medicine, Lublin, Poland, where postoperative investigations (CT, renal and liver function tests, abdominal USG, blood tests) were carried out. The tests excluded the progression of primary tumor to other organs. The patient received six courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamicin, vincristin, prednisone) protocol on a monthly basis. The patient is in a state of complete remission 10 months after surgery.  Histologic features The surgical specimen was a uterus (68×33mm) displaying a diffusely enlarged cervix measuring 11cm in diameter. The diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was composed of sheets of large neoplastic cells deeply infiltrating cervical stroma (Fig. 1 ). Endocervical glands also were surrounded and separated by sheets of lymphoma cells, and frequently were dilated and filled with mucin. Cytologically, the neoplastic cells were large and oval, with moderately eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei were slightly pleomorphic and vesicular, and small nucleoli were seen elsewhere. The mitoses were conspicuous. The neoplastic cells were B-cells interspersed with small to moderate proportions of small T-cells.   Immunophenotypic presentation Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on paraffin-embedded sections of surgical specimens using the avidin–biotin–peroxidase technique [8,14,15]. The following primary antibodies were applied for immunophenotypic examination: LCA (CD45; 1:100), L26 (CD20; 1:200), BCL-2 (clone 124; 1:40), BCL-6 (clone PG-B6p; 1:20), CD3 (clone F7.2.38; 1;50), and CD30 (clone Ki-1; 1;40). All antibodies were purchased from DakoCytomation (Denmark). Tumor cells were intensely positive for LCA, L26, and BCL6, but immunostaining was negative for BCL2, CD3, and CD30. Fifty-two percent of tumor cells were positive for Ki-67 nuclear proliferative antigen (Fig. 1; Table 1 ) The antibodies applied and the immunostaining patterns are summarized in Table 1.  "
865,S1590-8658(13)00207-7,Primary intestinal B-cell lymphoma: A prospective multicentre clinical study of 91 cases," 2 Patients and Methods  2.1 Patients From January 1991 to January 2000, the cases of PIL were collected as a part of a multicenter study on gastrointestinal lymphomas conducted by the French Digestive Lymphoma Study Group (Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes Digestifs, GELD). Twenty four centers recruited the patients for this study. According to the study chart, data concerning demographic, clinical, biological and histological features, as well as the treatment applied and the clinical outcome, had to be recorded in a prospective manner. Therapeutic guidelines were given and followed for each subtype of lymphoma, but the therapeutic strategy for individual patient was left to the discretion of the investigator and had to be registered. Furthermore, the follow-up data were collected. The primary character of intestinal lymphoma was defined according to Lewin et al as either predominant intestinal lesion without previous peripheral lymphadenopathy or any lymphoma whose clinical presentation was related to intestinal involvement [22]. The diagnosis of PIL was based on the WHO classification [23]. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients and the study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. Medical history and symptoms were recorded and for each patient the WHO index was evaluated. Initial clinical symptoms were divided into five principal categories: abdominal pain, bloody stools, diarrhoea, abdominal mass, and obstruction.   2.2 Histology and immunohistochemistry Histology of each tumour, based on endoscopic biopsies and/or surgical material, was reviewed by at least two expert pathologists. Tumours were reclassified according to the WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues [23]. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded or fresh frozen biopsies, and included staining with anti-CD20, anti-CD3 and anti-cytokeratin antibodies to confirm the B-cell nature of the lymphoid infiltrate and to visualize lymphoepithelial lesions. Additional staining with anti-CD5, anti-CD10, anti-cyclin D1, anti-bcl-2 and MIB-1 (Ki67) was used to further characterize the tumour [24,25].   2.3 Staging The staging procedure included recording of patients’ complete history, physical examination, routine haematological and biochemical tests (liver function test, full blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, ?-2microglobulinemia, and viral serologies), upper and lower endoscopy (with multiple biopsies of the tumour and multilevel systematic biopsies), small bowel and chest X-rays or thoracic CT-Scan, abdominal CT-Scan, Waldeyer's ring examination and bone marrow biopsy. Cerebrospinal fluid was studied in patients with disseminated diffuse large B cell lymphomas and Burkitt's lymphomas. Extension of the disease was defined according to the Ann Arbor staging system, modified by Musshoff [26].   2.4 Treatment and response to treatment Therapeutic guidelines included initial surgical tumour resection only if necessary for emergency or diagnostic purpose. Primary resection was avoided when there was a risk of mortality, or of morbidity delaying chemotherapy, or when the extent of resection was considered excessive with multiple lymphoma localisations. According to the histological type, patients were offered different therapeutic strategies. Response to treatment was assessed at the end of the initial chemotherapy by a work-up identical to the pre-therapeutic one. Complete remission was defined as complete disappearance of any lesion from all sites initially involved and the absence of new tumours. Further evaluations were planned every year for at least 5 years. Other treatment outcomes were classified, according to the defined criteria as partial remission, stability of the disease, progression of the disease, and death.   2.5 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.3. The survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall Survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of the final follow-up or death from any cause. Progression Free Survival (PFS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of disease progression, relapse or to the date of the final follow-up. Comparisons between the groups were tested by the log-rank test.  "

After extra-cerebral progression under a second line of chemotherapy with pemetrexed, a new lung biopsy was performed in December 2010 to analyze mutational status (Fig. 1 ). There was an EML4-ALK gene translocation with no EGFR and Kras mutations; the EML4-ALK status was screened with immunohistochemical detection of the ALK protein by an ALK1 clone antibody. It was confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for ALK. The patient started crizotinib – an ALK inhibitor – in October 2010 (Fig. 2 ) with an initial partial response in December 2010 followed by a stable disease until October 2011. After a twelve months progression-free survival (PFS), the patient presented a rapid progression compared to previous imagery with cerebral, lung, mediastinal progression and the appearance of an ovarian metastasis (Figs. 3 and 4  ). Cerebral lesions increased in size and number, still remaining asymptomatic. As shown in Fig. 4, there were over 100 nodular and micro-nodular lesions very well defined in T2-weighted sequences, with no surrounding edema, and hardly seen in T1-weighted with or without gadolinium sequences. The patient refused whole brain radiotherapy for personal reasons and unfortunately died in February 2012 of a fatal pulmonary embolism. "
873,S0039-6257(05)00193-1,Primary Testicular and Intraocular Lymphomas: Two Case Reports and a Review of the Literature," Case Reports  Case 1 A 75-year-old white man with a previous history of testicular lymphoma presented with a chief complaint of decreased vision OU in March 1998. Ocular examination revealed bilateral vitritis that was greater in the right eye. Systemic evaluation included normal blood work and a bone marrow biopsy that revealed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Imaging studies of the brain, chest, and abdomen were all negative. Cytologic examination of a diagnostic vitrectomy specimen from the right eye was negative for malignancy in May 1999. The patient had a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarctions in 1968 and 1994, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Parkinson disease. In March 1985 he was diagnosed with prostate carcinoma that was successfully treated with resection and pelvic radiation therapy. He was diagnosed with right testicular lymphoma that was treated with an orchiectomy in July 1992 followed by prophylactic orchiectomy of the left testis in August 1992 and an unknown regimen of chemotherapy. His medications included simvastatin, metoprolol, cimetidine, carbidopa/levidopa, amitriptyline, aspirin, diclofenac, vitamin E, ipratropium, albuterol, beclomethasone, and nitroglycerine as needed. Ocular examination in March 2000 revealed a visual acuity of 20/50 OD and 20/80 OS with intraocular pressures of 16.5 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS and no afferent pupillary defect. He scored 15/16 OD and 0/16 OS on the Ishihara color plates. Anterior segment examination was normal except for the presence of 2+ nuclear sclerosis OU and a fine dusting of cells on the inferior aspect of the posterior capsule OD. Posterior segment examination of the right eye revealed trace vitreous cells without haze and no apparent retinal lesions. The optic nerve cup-to-disk ratio was 0.4. Examination of the posterior segment of the left eye revealed marked vitritis with 3+ vitreous cells and 2+ haze. Mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium and subretinal infiltrates in the posterior pole were noted in the left eye although the vitritis obscured the view of the macula ( Fig. 1A). The cup-to-disk ratio of the optic nerve was 0.4. Fluorescein angiogram of the right eye revealed no cystoid macular edema. Angiography of the left eye provided a limited view. A repeat angiogram post vitrectomy in the left eye in late March 2000, however, revealed multiple blocking defects typical of those described in patients with PIOL (Fig. 1B). 6,64  Imaging studies included an MRI of the brain which revealed periventricular white matter changes consistent with small vessel ischemia, but there was no evidence of tumor. Computerized tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was unremarkable with no evidence of tumor. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed the absence of malignant cells and no erythrocytes, although there were 25 white blood cells present, 95% of which were lymphocytes. Cytokine analysis of the CSF revealed an IL-6 level < 7.8 pg/ml (normal IL-6 level < 15.6 pg/ml) and an IL-10 = 15.4 pg/ml (normal IL-10 level < 11.7 pg/ml) with an IL-10: IL-6 ratio of 1.97. Histopathologic examination of the diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy specimen from the left eye revealed malignant large B lymphoid cells. Consequently, the patient returned to his referring ophthalmologist and oncologist for treatment.   Case 2 The second case was a 61-year-old white man with a history of a stage IIa, intermediate grade, polymorphic, centroblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the left epididymis of the testis and the para-aortic lymph nodes. He received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy six times, achieving complete remission after two courses, although there was persistence of the M component in the serum. A year later a hypothalamic lesion was noted on MRI. Although a specimen of the CSF was clear of malignant cells, the patient was treated with 40 Gy to the brain and eyes and six courses of intrathecal methotrexate. He was in remission for 4 years until vitreous haze was noted in his right eye. Although his bone marrow was negative for recurrence, he was treated with six cycles of chlorambucil and prednisone achieving clinical remission in the eye in February 1998. In May 1998, a recurrence was noted in the thalamus, although the CSF again was clear of malignant lymphoid cells. He again achieved remission following treatment with six cycles of methotrexate, procarbazine, CCNU, and prednisone. In January 1999, however, worsening vitritis was noted in the right eye. In February 1999, a subretinal lesion was noted in the temporal mid-periphery on funduscopic examination and fluorescein angiogram ( Fig. 2A and B). A pars plana vitrectomy performed in the right eye was diagnostic for a large B-cell lymphoma, as was an aspirate of the subretinal cells. The subretinal mass lesion subsided with the use of a combination of intravitreal methotrexate and dexamethasone. The patient passed away after three months from complications of radiotherapy and CNS lymphoma.  "

Herein, we describe a case of a patient with HIV presenting with right hydronephrosis and obstructive changes which on biopsy confirms diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Though urothelial carcinomas makes up most histologic diagnoses with involvement of this region, lymphomas should remain in the differential, especially in this population of patients, because it might obviate the need for radical nephroureterectomy and dictates a different therapeutic approach.

883,S0090-8258(05)00351-3,Primary cervical lymphoma: Report of two cases and review of the literature," Case history  Patient 1 Fifty-one-year-old parous women presented with abnormal vaginal discharge for 2 years. She had been treated with different combined antifungal and antibiotic regimens but her complaints did not respond to these therapies. Her initial Pap smear was reported as inflammation and smear 1 year later was reported as HSIL after which she was admitted to our clinic. On gynecologic examination, the uterus was slightly larger than normal size. Also a solid, mobile pelvic mass was palpated. Cervix was apparently normal on speculum examination; however, radiological evaluation revealed a cervical mass with a diameter of 35 × 40 mm in a bicornuate uterus. LEEP was performed under colposcopy. Colposcopic examination did not reveal any abnormal findings; however, pathological examination of the LEEP material was reported as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Systemic examination did not show any other abnormal findings. Clinical staging work-up including chest radiograph, computed tomography of the abdomen and thorax, IVP, transvaginal ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy, and hematological parameters did not demonstrate any extragenital primary disease. Bone marrow biopsy was also negative. We performed abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salphingo-oopherectomy and pelvic, para-aortic lymphadenectomy. In macroscopic examination of the hysterectomy specimen, nearly 30 × 35 mm cervical mass was seen. Pathological examination of the hysterectomy specimens confirmed the initial diagnosis. The neoplastic cells showed a diffuse infiltration extending from submucosa to pericervical adipose tissue. The infiltrate was composed of large cells with vesicular nuclei and high mitotic–apoptotic index. Neoplastic cells were strongly positive for LCA (Leucocyte Common Antigen) and CD20 and showed a Ki-67 index of 50–60% (Figs. 1a, b) and negative for HPV and EBV. Lymph nodes were negative for tumoral metastasis. After these evaluations, patient was accepted as stage IE, primary cervical lymphoma and treated with 6 cycles CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy. She had no evidence of disease for 19 months after the initial diagnosis.   Patient 2 A 49-year-old, multigravid, postmenopausal woman was admitted to the hospital because of a routine gynecologic follow-up without any complaint. Patient's history, systemic and pelvic examination was not remarkable. However, a routine cytological smear of the cervix revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Then, a punch biopsy was performed under colposcopic examination, which showed inflammation. Due to discordance between cytology and histology, LEEP was performed, which revealed follicular lymphoma grade III. There was nodular and diffuse infiltrate of mononuclear cells starting under the eroded mucosa. The infiltrate was composed of pleomorphic large cells with prominent nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm. These cells were also positive for LCA and CD-20 (Fig. 1c) and negative for HPV and EBV. A complete clinical staging work-up including chest radiograph, computed tomography of the abdomen, transvaginal ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy, and hematological parameters was carried out. No extrapelvic disease and lymphadenopathy were detected. A bone marrow biopsy was also negative. Tests excluded progression of tumor to adjacent organs and indicated a malignancy confined to the cervix. A diagnosis of stage IE, B cell lymphoma was assigned according to Ann Arbor classification. Treatment was decided as for a NHL stage IE. The patient received six courses CHOP chemotherapy. After 22 months from the initial diagnosis, cytological and colposcopic assessments including LEEP revealed no evidence of disease and the patient is in clinical remission.  "
884,S0002-9378(06)00531-X,Primary uterine lymphoma: Report of 2 cases and review of literature," Patient 1 Mrs. JB, a 47-year-old female, presented in December 2004 with irregular bleeding from the vagina of 2 months' duration. Her past menstrual cycles were regular, and she did not have any gynecological complaints in the past. On examination she was found to have severe pallor, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status-3 without any evidence of peripheral lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Her uterus was just palpable in suprapubic region. Perspeculum revealed the cervix replaced by irregular bosselated growth. Digital examination revealed cervical growth, which bled on touch; anteverted uterus 12-14 weeks' size; obliterated bilateral fornices; and bilateral parametrium thickened with the right side reaching up to the pelvic wall. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed cervical growth involving the upper vagina, uniformly enlarged uterus, and bilateral vesiculoureteral junction obstruction with hydronephrosis of the right kidney. Serum lactatedehydrogenase (S LDH) - 1050 U/mL. The CAT scan chest was normal. Cervical biopsy showed NHL; diffuse large cell; and B-cell type positive for LCA and CD20 and negative for cytokeratin, synaptophysin, and chromogranin (  Figures 1 and 2). Bone marrow biopsy and touch imprint did not show any involvement by lymphoma. Multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan revealed normal left ventricular ejection fraction. She was staged as IE (Ann Arbor staging). Percutaneous nephrostomy was done on the right side for hydronephrosis, and she was started on cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) chemotherapy every 3 weeks. A post–3-cycle evaluation revealed significant reduction in the cervical mass and disappearance of vaginal involvement. A MUGA scan showed 38% left ventricular ejection fraction. In view of cardiotoxicity, Adriamycin was omitted. She received 3 more cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone. A post–6-cycle evaluation revealed no clinically palpable mass, a normal CAT scan, and serum LDH, 145 U/mL. She achieved complete remission. After chemotherapy she has received involved field radiotherapy to the pelvis, 45 Gy in 25 fractions until October 2005. Presently she is on follow-up and is disease free. "

900,S0344-0338(13)00206-9,Expression of FoxO3a in clinical cases of malignant lymphoma," Materials and methods  Patients A total of 137 patients diagnosed with malignant lymphoma at Osaka University Hospital from 1999 to 2012 were included in the current study. The histological classifications of these 137 patients are summarized in Table 1 . Histological specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and routinely processed for paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded specimens were stored in the dark room in the Department of Pathology of Osaka University Hospital at room temperature. They were then sectioned at 4-?m thickness at the time of staining with hematoxylin and eosin and performance of the immunohistochemical procedure. This study was approved by the institutional ethical review board of Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine (No. 12467).   Immunohistochemistry for FoxO3a and phosphorylated (p)-Akt FoxO3a and p-Akt expression was examined immunohistochemically using anti-FoxO3a and anti-p-Akt(Ser473) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA). Antigen retrieval was performed with a Pascal pressurized heating chamber (Dako). The sections were incubated with anti-FoxO3a (×100) and anti-p-Akt (×100) antibodies and treated with the ChemMate EnVision kit (Dako). Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Dako) was used as a chromogen. As a negative control, staining was performed in the absence of primary antibody. When FoxO3a and p-Akt signals were detected in a tumor, the case was judged as FoxO3a- and p-Akt-positive, respectively. Staining was evaluated by two pathologists independently (J.I. and E.M.).   Double staining of FoxO3a and Ki-67 Double staining of FoxO3a and Ki-67 was performed with the EnVision G/2 Doublestain System (Dako) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First, FoxO3a was stained with DAB, and staining of Ki-67 was subsequently performed with Permanent Red. Because red fluorescence is released from Permanent Red, the Ki-67 signal was detected with a fluorescence microscope (Biozero; Keyence, Osaka, Japan).   Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using t-tests. Values are means±standard error.  "

Cases with unusual presentation were studied in detail along with their immunohistochemical profile. In all patients, staging evaluation included hematological and chemical survey, in addition to chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography of the chest and abdomen, and bone marrow biopsy. Cases were staged according to the Ann Arbor staging system [3]. Complete data on followup was not available due to either inability of patient to complete followup or referral of patient to some higher/cancer speciality center. The patients were treated with combined radiochemotherapy. The dose of radiation therapy was between 35 and 45Gy, and CHOP chemotherapy regimen was employed. Complete Response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all evidence of lymphoma, as documented by a normal physical examination, blood tests, and radiologic imaging. When residual radiographic abnormalities were consistent with normal bone reformation, patients were considered in CR if no other possible signs of disease were present. Partial Response (PR) was defined as >50% reduction in tumor burden without CR after completion of treatment, and no response as anything else. Local failure was defined as failure in the initial bone site and/or in adjacent lymphnodes. Failure anywhere outside these confines was considered to be distant [4]. "
912,S0009-9260(17)30199-X,Is there an association between mesenteric panniculitis and lymphoma? A case control analysis," Materials and methods  Patients All available CT and combined positron-emission tomography (PET) with CT examinations of 166 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with NHL between the years 2008 and 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were from one institution, which is a tertiary referral centre (Rabin Medical Center, University Hospital). The cohort included 113 men and 53 women; with ages ranging from 19 to 94 years (mean age 64 years). The diagnosis of NHL was established before or during the research period and was histologically proven for all study patients. The initial PET-CT images were obtained prior to the initiation of chemotherapy. Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma were not included in the study as, to the authors' knowledge, it has never been described as associated with MP. Every patient with NHL was matched with two subjects who underwent abdominal CT without oral or intravenous contrast medium administration who were examined for renal colic in the Emergency Department during the same period of time (2008–2013). The control subjects were randomly chosen from a database and matched for gender, age, and the time period of the CT examination. The control group included a total of 332 subjects, 226 men and 106 women with a mean age of 65 years. None of the control group patients underwent PET-CT examination before or during the study period. The study was approved by the institutional review board.   Imaging protocols For the PET-CT examination patients received an intravenous injection of 13.5 mCi (500 MBq) of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG). Following the FDG injection, an uptake interval of 60 minutes was observed after which a static PET-CT examination of the body (skull-base to mid-thigh) was performed (Discovery STE, 8-detector row, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Patients without contraindications to intravenous contrast material were injected with 80–100 ml iopromide 0.623 g/ml (Ultravist 300; Bayer Healthcare, Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) at a rate of 1.5 ml/s using an automatic power injector and a CT scan of the body (from skull-base to mid-thigh) was acquired after a 70-second delay. All of the CT examinations of the control group subjects were performed at the same institution on a 16-section Philips MX8000IDT CT system, according to a protocol of both oral intake of 4% meglumine ioxitalamate (Telebrix, Telebrix Gastro, Guerbet, Roissy CDG Cedex, France) diluted in 1 l of drinking water approximately 2 hours before the examination and a 100 ml intravenous bolus of iohexol (Omnipaque, GE Healthcare Ireland, Cork, Ireland) injected 80 seconds pre-scan at 3.5 ml/s with the help of an automatic power injector.   Interpretation All CT and PET-CT studies were viewed by two experienced abdominal radiologists who agreed upon the presence and grade of the MP. Furthermore, all PET-CT examinations were reviewed by a nuclear medicine specialist for the purpose of distinguishing between MP and lymphomatous involvement of the mesentery. MP was identified using five criteria established by previous studies, as follows: mesenteric fat of inhomogeneously higher attenuation than adjacent retroperitoneal fat, containing small soft-tissue nodules up to 1 cm in short axis, which are surrounded by a hypo-attenuating “halo”, also seen around mesenteric blood vessels. The whole of the involved area possesses a hyperattenuating pseudo-capsule and has a mild “mass effect” on the surrounding tissues. The presence of MP was considered to be established when at least three out of the five above mentioned five signs were observed. 4,5,7,13   To distinguish MP from the involvement of mesentery by lymphoma, which sometimes leads to somewhat similar imaging findings of “misty mesentery”, the PET-CT findings of FDG uptake in the mesentery, the size of the soft-tissue nodules, and alteration of the findings in response to treatment and on follow-up studies were taken to indicate MP. 12,13,15  In cases where MP was discovered in a subject from the control group, all the available CT examinations and relevant clinical data for this subject were reviewed to search for a malignancy occurring concomitantly or that might have developed later on.   Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS for Windows version 21. Significance was set at 5%. All statistical tests were two-sided. Nominal p-values are presented. Where confidence limits were appropriate, two-sided 95% confidence intervals were constructed. The confidence interval was calculated using the exact binomical method due to a small number of MP cases. Continuous variables are expressed as means±SD. For comparison of proportions (categorical variables) between the lymphoma group and the control group, Fisher's exact test was used, as appropriate.  "

Workup included serum immunoglobulin studies which revealed IgG heavy chains with no associated light chain. The patient was immediately referred to Hematology–Oncology service for further management and follow up. Ultrasound of her thyroid in 2009 was negative for nodules but 7months later, it showed a diffusely enlarged gland. A fine needle aspirate was done which revealed chronic thyroiditis. She had no palpitations, tremor or neck discomfort in the past; however she began developing mild compression symptoms. Thyroidectomy was performed approximately 1month after the diagnosis of ? heavy chain disease. The histologic findings, together with the serum and urine protein studies, were most in keeping with a heavy chain variant of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The patient underwent radiation after surgery. At approximately 7weeks after surgery, the patient appeared free of complaints and the abnormal band in the serum and urine studies have disappeared. "

She presented with vaginal spotting, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, from which she had suffered for 1 week. On pelvic examination, no definite vaginal mass lesion was palpable. Abdominal ultrasonography showed multiple myomas of the uterus. A preoperative diagnosis was CIN 3 with uterine myoma. The cervical biopsy was then performed followed by conization. No enlarged lymph node was found in the postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis. However, the CBC showed leukocytosis (21.8×109/L) with presence of atypical lymphocytes (4%) and bands (4%) (Table 1 ). Eight days later, simple hysterectomy was undertaken due to the presence of CIN 3. The preoperative data of CBC did not show any remarkable change compared with the last one. Unfortunately, 2 days after hysterectomy, atypical lymphocytes markedly increased up to 34% in the peripheral blood (Table 1). The bone marrow study was positive for lymphomatous involvement.

On examination, the visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. In ambient light, the right pupil measured 5.5 mm and the left 4 mm. The right pupil was sluggishly reactive to direct light stimulation as compared to the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Eye movements in the right eye were abnormal with limited adduction, infraduction, and supraduction ( Fig. 1). Eye movements in the left eye were normal. The remainder of the ocular, cranial nerve and neurological examinations were normal. Chest radiography, angiotensin-converting enzyme level, comprehensive metabolic profile, serum protein electrophoresis, syphilis serology, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and Lyme serology were all normal or negative. Mantoux skin test was negative with a negative anergy panel. White blood count was normal and hemoglobin level was 11.4 g/dl (normal range, 13.0–16.5 g/dl). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 92 mm/h. A lumbar puncture revealed the following results: red blood count 54 cu/mm, white blood count 136 cu/mm (100% monocytes), protein concentration >1,500 mg/dl and glucose 10 mg/dl. Serology for HIV was positive and confirmed by Western blot analysis. Further systemic workup for staging purposes and chemotherapy was recommended to the patient, however, he declined any further evaluation and treatment. He was discharged from the hospital to hospice care and died within 2 weeks of discharge.   Radiologic Findings A computed tomography (CT) study of the brain without and with intravenous iodine contrast administration was performed. CT angiography study of the intracranial vessels was also obtained to evaluate for an underlying aneurysm. The CT angiography study demonstrated a 4-mm mass within the superior lateral aspect of the cavernous sinus on the right. The mass caused mild inferior displacement of and indentation upon the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus ( Fig. 2). The MRI examination without and with intravenous gadolinium administration demonstrated enlargement of the cisternal and cavernous portion of the right cranial nerve III. In addition, enhancement of the cisternal portions of both cranial nerve III as well as of the cavernous portion of the right cranial nerve III was observed ( Fig. 3). There were no other intracranial abnormalities noted, in particular there were no signs of leptomeningeal or dural enhancement, intraparenchymal brain lesions, aneurysm, or hydrocephalus.   Pathologic Findings  Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Cerebrospinal fluid cytologic examination demonstrated malignant cells. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis of the CSF demonstrated strongly positive CD 20 and CD 45 cells. The CD4/CD8 ratio was markedly inverted to 1:7. Morphological examination of the cells revealed them to be large and atypical with an increased nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, irregular nuclear contours, prominent nucleoli, agranular basophilic cytoplasm, and apoptotic bodies ( Fig. 4).   Gross Autopsy was limited to examination of the brain. The fixed brain weighed 1,400 grams and revealed no obvious external abnormalities, with the exception of slight meningeal opacity over the frontal convexities and basilar cisterns. Both cranial nerve III appeared prominent, and there was no evidence of herniation ( Fig. 5). A portion of the bony sella turcica and adjacent cavernous sinuses (decalcified) revealed prominent cavernous cranial nerve III segments on both sides.   Microscopic There was diffuse infiltration of the leptomeninges by atypical lymphoid cells, with slightly indented nuclei, relatively open chromatin and prominent nucleoli, cytologically consistent with cells seen in CSF during life. There was extensive invasion of both cranial nerve III by the same atypical lymphoid cells ( Fig. 6). Immunostains confirmed that the atypical lymphoid cells were strongly CD20-immunoreactive and CD3-immunonegative, consistent with a monoclonal B-cell proliferation ( Figs. 7 and  8). Lymphomatous involvement of the brain per se was limited to focal invasion of right lateral ventricular subependymal, and dorsal mesencephalic (Fig. 8) and pontine subpial, parenchyma; deeper parenchymal involvement was not seen at any level.

The tissue specimens were fixed in formalin, routinely processed, and embedded in paraffin. For light microscopy, the sections were stained using hematoxylin–eosin and Giemsa. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections using a Ventana-automated (BenchMark™) stainer according to the manufacturer's directions. A panel of antibodies against human immunoglobulin light chain (kappa and lambda) (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), IgD (Novocastra), IgM (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), PS-1 (CD3; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), 4C7 (CD5; Novocastra), 56C6 (CD10; Novocastra), L26 (CD20; Nichirei Co., Tokyo, Japan), a cocktail of 2G9 and RBL25 (CD21+CD35; Novocastra), 137B4(CD27; Novocastra ), DFT-1(CD43; Novocastra), UCHL-1 (CD45RO; Nichirei Co.), JCB117C (CD79a; Dako), 124 (bcl-2; Dako), and AE1/3 (Dako) were used. The primary antibodies were replaced by normal rabbit- and mouse-serum as a negative control. In situ hybridization (ISH) with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER) oligonucleotides was performed to test for the presence of EBV small RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using a Ventana-automated (BenchMark™) stainer.

943,S0753-3322(06)00066-7,Analysis of cell proliferation and cell death during in situ hyperthermic treatment of neoplastic cells: a case report of human non-Hodgkin lymphoma," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Hyperthermic treatment and sample collection The first patient, a 63-year-old man affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma was treated with two cycles of localized hyperthermia during a relapse after chemotherapy. The main localization of the disease was an axillary mass. The treatment was performed with a radio frequency (RF) generator (Theratherm, Italy) at 13.56 MHz with external capacitive applicators, connected with a cooling system. Each session lasted 90 min and the tissue temperature was controlled and kept in the 41–43 °C range via a subcutaneous probe. The two hyperthermia sessions were performed with 72 h intervals, to avoid cellular thermotolerance. Cell samples were collected at the end of each treatment by a needle biopsy. Aliquots of cells were in part smeared for cytochemical assays and in part were pelleted in 2% agar for ultrastructural analysis.   2.2 DNA/RNA differential staining To obtain the simultaneous labeling of the DNA and RNA in single cells, the specimens were submitted to the Acridine Orange (AO) fluorochromization: fixation in ethanol/acetic acid (3:1), hydratation in ethanols, incubation with 0.01% AO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for 3 min, mounting in phosphate buffer and coverglass sealing. The specimens were immediately examined and photographed under a fluorescence microscope in epi-excitation at 490 nm to obtain a red fluorescence (metachromatic RNA labeling) and a green fluorescence (orthochromatic DNA labeling) emission.   2.3 Antiproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunocytochemistry Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. The unmasking of antigen epitope was induced by heating the specimens at 95 °C for 10 min in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Non-specific binding was blocked by incubating the slides in 10% normal rabbit serum in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. In the immunostaining, the PAP method was used. The cells were first incubated overnight with a mouse monoclonal antibody (PC10) against PCNA (Dako, Glostrup, DK) diluted 1:20 at room temperature in a humidified chamber. In the second step, a rabbit antibody against a mouse IgG diluted 1:50 was applied for 2 h. Finally the incubation with peroxidase–antiperoxidase complex (PAP) diluted 1:200 was performed for 2 h at room temperature. Between each conjugation, specimens were washed for 10 min with PBS buffer. The staining color of the immunolabeling was developed using a 0.1% diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution. The specimens were then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E). For negative controls, the primary antibodies were replaced with a solution containing phosphate-buffered saline and the immunostaining was carried out; in this case no specific immunoreactivity was found.   2.4 Apoptotic DNA fragmentation cytochemistry The apoptotic cell death was essayed by in situ detection of DNA fragmentation using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TUNEL) assay (Oncogene Res. Prod., Boston, MA, USA). Cells fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde were incubated for 5 min with 20 ?g ml?1 proteinase-K solution at room temperature, followed by treatment with 3% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After incubation with the TUNEL solution (90 min with TdT/biotinylated dNTP and 30 min with HRP-conjugate streptavidin) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C, the reaction was developed using a 0.1% DAB solution with 0.2% H2O2. The specimens were lightly counterstained with H&E. As a negative control, the TdT incubation was omitted.   2.5 Counting procedure and statistics The rate of cells undergoing mitosis (M.I.), DNA replication (PCNA L.I.) and apoptosis (TUNEL L.I.) were evaluated by scoring different specimens in light microscopy with a ×40 objective. The results were expressed as the mean number of labeled cells per 100 intact cells±S.D. The comparison between pre- and post-treatment were performed by using the Student's t-test; a P-value lower than 0.01 was considered statistically significant. An evaluation of the change in cell population growth during the treatment was obtained by the M.I./TUNEL L.I. and PCNA L.I./TUNEL L.I. ratios.   2.6 Transmission electron microscopy Cell pellet samples were fixed at 4 °C for 3 h in 1.5% glutaraldehyde buffered to pH 7.4 with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, washed in buffer, post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, washed in buffer, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in Epon 812. Thin (600 Å) sections were double stained with saturated uranyl acetate in 50% acetone and with Reynold's lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss 900 TEM operating at 50 kV.  "

Abnormal nodules were found in the lung (one in right upper lobe and another in the right lower lobe). Almost 2 years later, Chest CT revealed that the nodule in the right lower lobe had grown. After complete resection, pathological sections revealed the similar pathological features of two adenocarcinomas. As the L858R mutation within exon 21 of the EGFR gene was identified in the lower lobe tumor but not in the upper-lobe tumor, we diagnosed as double primary lung adenocarcinomas. We performed the right lower lobe tumor. Pathological examination revealed a combined adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.      "
961,B978-0-323-35762-3.00080-9,"Chapter 80 Clinical Manifestations, Staging, and Treatment of Follicular Lymphoma"," Epidemiology It is estimated that in 2016 more than 72,500 cases of NHL will be diagnosed in the United States and more than 20,000 patients will die of their disease, making NHL the seventh most common cancer and the fifth most common cause of death from cancer (http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/nhl.html). NHL is extremely heterogeneous in its molecular pathophysiology, histology, and clinical course, and there are major differences in the incidence of subtypes in different geographic locations and among different racial and ethnic populations. This difference in geographic distribution is particularly striking for FL and in the Western world, FL is the second most common lymphoma, comprising approximately 20% of all NHLs. The incidence of FL in the United States is approximately 3.18 cases per 100,000 persons per year and in Europe is approximately 2.18 cases per 100,000 persons per year. 2  The incidence of FL and other indolent lymphomas is shown in Table 80.1 . The incidence appears stable over time. There is no strong sex preponderance, but the incidence in whites is approximately twice that of black and Asian populations and the disease appears less common in Central and South America. The incidence increases with age and the median age of diagnosis is 65 years. Although most cases are sporadic, there is an increased incidence in family members of affected individuals, with a relative risk of 2.3 for siblings of patients. 3  Differentiation of complex environmental factors from true inherited factors remains difficult. The complexity of the epidemiology of NHL mirrors the complexity of the disease and the complexity of the immune system. Since lymphomas do not constitute a single disease, it should come as no surprise that there is no single etiologic factor. The influence on immune dysregulation of viruses, chemicals, radiation, diet, and aging remains unclear. Immune suppression leads to increased incidence of aggressive lymphomas, but not usually indolent lymphomas. FL typically presents in middle age and in the older adult, and the median age at diagnosis is 60 years. There is a slight female preponderance. 2   "
965,S1752-928X(13)00319-3,A case of atypical chronic subdural hematoma: A spontaneous rupture of dural lymphoma nodule," 2 Case history A 40-year-old Caucasian woman went to stay a couple of weeks in an African country. Her medical history included local radiation therapy to the treat a breast cancer several years before. She had been in complete remission over a year. The last oncologist consultation was strictly normal. This young woman's state of health presented constitutional hemostasis disorders. She had von Willebrand disease with a low degree of bleeding tendency. A unique cause of excess hemorrhage was reported after the delivery of her last daughter. Any medication wasn't prescribed to this hereditary coagulation abnormality. She had no known addictive tendencies. Several days after her arrival, she had paroxysmal hyperthermia, accompanied a few hours later by photophobia, difficulty in walking and confusion. The diagnosis of pernicious malaria was suggested, but her neurological condition worsened with a coma (Glasgow score of 6). After several hours, she was taken in charge by ambulance to local hospital. Resuscitation measures did not prevent the patient's death in hospital. A local autopsy concluded that death was caused by pneumonia. The transportation to hospital took more time than family's waiting for, they lodged a complaint against French insurance. Following cold storage, the victim's body was repatriated to France, and an autopsy was performed in our laboratory. External examination of the body showed that this woman was 165 cm in height and weighed 56 kg. Bruising was present around the vascular access sites. The examination of the skull and face did not reveal any injuries from blows or wounds. On opening the cranial space, a subdural hematoma forming a right hemispheric biconvex lens was discovered (Fig. 1 ). It weighed 90 g, was wine red in color and consisted of an encapsulated collection with liquefaction (Fig. 2 ). The examination of the deep surface of the scalp did not uncover any traumatic lesion. Neither the vault nor the base of the cranium showed a fracture. The brain weighed 1295 g and appeared normal in cross section. The macroscopic examination of the other organs was normal and unremarkable. Our preliminary report indicated that the death resulted from a chronic SDH rose up by hereditary coagulopathy following a simple bump that went unnoticed. Relatives gave no indication of anything traumatic in the several weeks preceding her death. Histological investigations then uncovered a multi-organ, generalized lymphoid infiltration (heart, lungs, kidneys, spleen, liver, and thyroid) by a small-cell lymphoma (Fig. 3 ). The examination of the cerebral cortex showed these lymphoid infiltrations as well (Fig. 4 ). A small-cell lymphoid nodule, disrupted by erythrocytes was found in the falxcerebri of the meninges (Fig. 5 ). The immune markers CD03, CD20 and CD038 were negative, but the interpretation of the results was made difficult by the autolysis phenomena of the tissues examined. The examination of the SDH using light microscopy showed the criteria of chronicity. Toxicological examinations (cardiac and peripheral bloods, urine, and vitreous humor) did not reveal any recent or old consumption of toxic substances such as cocaine or alcohol. Following these additional investigations our conclusion stated that chronic right circumferential SDH was the cause of death. This hematoma rose up by von Willebrand disease originated with the “spontaneous” hemorrhagic rupture of a nodule of lymphoid infiltrate in the meninges of the falxcerebri. The idea of even minor trauma could be rejected in our final report. "
970,S0090-3019(05)00031-5,Primary central nervous system lymphoma of the brain stem responding favorably to radiosurgery: A case report and literature review," 2 Case history A 55-year-old white woman presented with complaints of weakness on the left side of her body lasting for 2 days and double vision associated with a frontal headache that started approximately 4 weeks earlier. Upon further questioning, the patient also admitted to gait instability and a right eyelid droop. The patient had hypertension managed with atenolol and seizure disorder that was controlled with dilantin and phenobarbital. Her last seizure episode occurred 3 years before her current complaint. The patient's surgical history included a hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and removal of a benign breast mass. On physical examination, the patient was an obese white woman in no acute distress, but very lethargic. Cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hematologic, skin, endocrine, and immunologic reviews of systems were all negative. Nervous system examination revealed a right-sided oculomotor palsy and a left-sided motor paresis, grade 2/5, in both upper and lower limbs. The other cranial nerves were functionally intact, and the sensory system examination was essentially normal. Her Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 50.  2.1 Investigations A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) of the brain was ordered and revealed an irregular space-occupying lesion in the pons that enhanced uniformly with gadolinium (Fig. 1 ). In addition, the scan also revealed that despite the location of the tumor, there was no mechanical obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow pathways. Laboratory investigations included a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and clotting studies. The patient was noted to have a leukocytosis and mildly elevated platelet counts. Considering the absence of CSF flow obstruction, it was deemed safe to perform a spinal tap. The CSF analysis showed elevated proteins and marginally elevated white cell count. A cytology study of the CSF showed nonspecific leukocytes with minimal red blood cells. In an attempt to obtain a definitive tissue diagnosis before deciding treatment options, a computed tomography–guided, frame-based, stereotactic biopsy was performed using the Cosman-Roberts-Wells system. This was performed under intravenous sedation and local anesthesia. Considering the precarious location of the tumor, a long-axis approach from the frontal parasagittal region was used to obtain representative tissue samples from 2 locations within the tumor.   2.2 Pathology The histopathology of the lesion was a B-cell malignant lymphoma (Fig. 2 ). Sections of the small biopsy tissue reveal brain that is diffusely infiltrated by large pleomorphic lymphoid cells (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Tumor has infiltrated the walls of several small vessels in the tissue. Rare mitotic figures are seen. CD20, a B-cell marker, is strongly positive in the tumor cells.   2.3 Treatment The various treatment options available were discussed with the patient and her family, and it was decided to perform stereotactic radiosurgery using the Leksell gamma knife (Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, Ga). A dose of 11 Gy was delivered to the tumor margin enclosed in the 50% isodose line. Care was taken to avoid any part of the pons getting >10 Gy (Fig. 4 ).   2.4 Follow-up The patient returned to the clinic 2 months after the procedure. Her KPS had improved to 70 from the preoperative level of 50. She was able to walk independently with the aid of a cane and was more alert. A follow-up MRI scan was ordered and revealed a 50% reduction in the size of the enhancing lesion (Fig. 5 ). This correlated with the improvement in her clinical condition and neurological status. However, 6 months later, she was readmitted to the hospital with severe pneumonitis and drowsiness. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed hydrocephalus for which a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. She could not recover from her moribund respiratory state and died days after admission.  "
972,S1741-9409(05)00012-9,Enlargement of mandibular canal with tongue paresthesia caused by extranodal B-cell Lymphoma: A case report," Discussion The lymphomas are a group of neoplasms arising in the reticuloendothelial and lymphatic system. Lymphoma is a common cancer but because of a younger average of diagnosis, lead to more years of potential life lost than other adult cancers 1 . Lymphomas originated in B-Cell are less common than in T-Cell. Several reports on lymphoma have demonstrated a unique expansion of the bone. Som et al. 2  described a lymphoma arising in the nasal cavity that had developed with enlarging and widening of the nasal cavity. There was no destruction of the nasal bone on CT findings. Robbins et al. 3  reported radiolucent changes with widening of the mental foramen in a lymphoma occurring in the mandible. Delpassand et al. 4  reported enlargement of the cavernous sinus caused by lymphoma without bone destruction. It is of interest that a low-grade lymphoma of soft tissue sometimes grows in the epidural spaces or along the nervous tissue. In osseous sites, lymphoma may extend into the modularly component However, in the mandible, lymphoma may involve the inferior alveolar canal, often without radiographic evidence of bony changes. 5     In this patient, Lymphoma was presented as mandibular intraosseous lesion with enlargement of mandibular canal. Paresthesia of tongue can indicate compression or infiltration of Lingual nerve in ramus area. However no sensory of molar nerve disturbances in mental region were recognized and despite the presence of tumor impingement inside the mandibular canal, mandibular nervous tissue were unlikely to be involve. Similar appearances to this case have been reported in other diseases (Table 1 ). 6–9  Shapiro et al. 6  reported 6 cases of a wide mandibular canal and an enlarged mandibular foramen in patients with neurofibromatosis. Horswell et al. 7  also reported a case of arteriovenous malformation, showing a twice–normal width mandibular canal on a panoramic radiograph. However, in all those cases, enlargements of the mandibular canal were confined to the mandibular foramen or the area near the mandibular angle. Their results were quite different from those presented here, which showed continuous widening throughout the mandibular canal. Schenberg et al. 8  reported a case of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2b. They considered that an appearance of markedly enlarged and bifurcated inferior alveolar canals on a panoramic radiograph were due to enlarged inferior alveolar nerve. Yamada et al. 9  reported a case of malignant lymphoma that enlarged mandibular canal without sensory disturbance. This case is probably the second one, to show an enlargement of the mandibular canal from extranodullar B-cell Lymphoma, but sensory disturbance was observed in an interest area tongue. "

The 18F-FDG PET/CT (Fig. 1 ) showed diffuse, hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis consistent with lymphomatous recurrence. There was also a small hypermetabolic focus of activity within the liver, which was not described on the original PET-CT report, but was noted retrospectively on follow-up. The patient underwent chemotherapy and returned for a 3-month imaging follow-up. The 18F-FDG PET/CT (Fig. 2 ) showed significant interval improvement in diffuse hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy consistent with metabolic response to treatment. However, there was interval worsening of hepatic disease and development of other new hepatic lesions, as well as interval development of a small, focal area of rectal wall thickening with an associated hypermetabolic perirectal lymph node, raising suspicion for a separate disease process. Biopsy of the intrahepatic lesions revealed metastatic small-cell carcinoma. Subsequent colonoscopy and biopsy of the thickened portion of the rectum was also consistent with primary rectal small-cell carcinoma. "
980,S2352-6475(17)30048-5,Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma: A review and assessment of cutaneous manifestations," Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma Within the spectrum of CD30+ ALCL, a more recently recognized clinical entity is the development of ALCL in association with breast implants (Aladily et al., 2012a, 2012b). Whereas pure ALCL of the breast is a clinical rarity, an increase has been observed in the number of reported cases of biALCL in patients who received silicone or saline breast implants. It has been difficult to quantify the estimated incidence and prevalence of biALCL due to a fairly recent formal recognition and reporting of this entity; however, a case-control study that utilized the national 9 million-patient pathology database was conducted in the Netherlands and established an association between ALCL and breast implants in comparison with patients without an implant, with an estimated odds ratio of 18.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], [2.1-156.8]; de Jong et al., 2008). On the basis of their study, an annual incidence was estimated at 0.1 to 0.3 per 100,000 women with implants (de Jong et al., 2008). Although this estimated incidence is quite uncommon, the steady increase in the number of women who receive breast implants makes it highly pertinent to improve awareness of this clinical entity. In light of concerns over a causal relationship between breast implants and the development of biALCL, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration formally issued a warning for the public in 2011, recognizing a possible link between ALCL and breast implants. Of note, there appears to be no difference in the rate of biALCL occurrence among women who receive implants for breast augmentation versus reconstruction for breast cancer or prophylaxis (Clemens and Miranda, 2015).

Due to double vision, he was admitted to our clinic. From his medical history, we noted a history of syphilitic infection about 20 years ago for which he was treated with intravenous penicillin G. General physical examination was normal. The neurological examination on admission revealed hypoesthesia over the right chin, limitation of the abduction in the right eye and diplopia on lateral gaze to the right. Otherwise, the ophthalmologic and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI scans with gadolinium were normal. Mandibular imaging was not performed. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient developed left sixth cranial nerve palsy, and on day 7 developed right upper lid ptosis. His evolution was progressive until complete bilateral ophthalmoplegia and numbness of both sides of the chin on day 18. Standard laboratory tests on admission were normal except for slight leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) examination showed normal opening pressure, glucose, protein and cell count. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-standard DNA, anticardiolipin antibodies, circulating immune complexes, the IgM and IgG antiganglioside antibodies panel, Borrelia burgdorferi IgG and IgM antibodies, immunoelectrophoresis, HIV testing, prostate specific antigen test, carcinoembryonic antigen, and alpha-fetoprotein markers were within normal limits. Serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Treponema pallidum Haemagglutination Assay (TPHA) were positive. A second lumbar puncture that was performed 10 days after admission excluded neurosyphilis by a negative VDRL and THPA in CSF. A thoracic-abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed two hypodense lesions in the liver segments IVA and II, irregular thickening of the gastric and ileal wall up to 21mm, and multiple abdominal adenopathies (Fig. 1 ). Gastric biopsy established the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Meanwhile, the patient developed marked fatigue, fever, sweats, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy was performed that showed multiple tumours of the small intestinal wall with approximate dimensions of 2cm at a distance of 10cm, tumour of the stomach wall, multiple liver tumour masses in both lobes and appendicular tumour. Appendectomy and liver biopsies were performed. Histopathological findings of the liver biopsy and appendicular walls suggested BL: the normal tissue structures were replaced by a homogeneous infiltrate with monotonous pattern, composed of medium-sized tumour cells with uniform shape and multiple small basophile nucleoli on a starry sky background involving whole appendicular wall, the periappendicular adipose tissue of mesenterium; the cells had an extremely high proliferation rate with many mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies. Immunophenotype of tumour cells confirmed the diagnosis of BL: they showed membrane IgM expression and B-cell-associated antigens (CD20, Pax-5), LCA, CD10, being negative for CD3, Bcl-2, CD23 and TdT. The Ki 67 proliferation index was nearly 100% (Fig. 2a–d). The patient died two days after surgery by cardiopulmonary arrest. The family of the patient refused the autopsy. "

Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical analysis of CD3 and TdT using the automated Bond system (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK) was performed using manufacturer specification. Immunohistochemical staining for LMO2 was performed courtesy of Dr. Elizabeth Hyjek of the University of Chicago. Immunohistochemical staining for PDGFRA was performed at NeoGenomics Laboratories (Aliso Viejo, CA).   DNA extraction and Chromosomal Microarray (CMA) analysis Genomic DNA was extracted from a frozen lymph node and a bone marrow (BM) aspirate sample with a Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). CMA analysis of the lymph node sample was performed using the Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Assay (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), which utilizes Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) technology to obtain accurate genome-wide copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) profiles. CMA analysis of the BM aspirate sample obtained at the time of progression was performed using the Affymetrix CytoScanTM HD arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). For both array platforms, sample preparation, hybridization, washing and labeling procedures were performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. The data were analyzed with the Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software from Affymetrix (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).   Molecular testing for sequence abnormalities and abnormal gene fusions Molecular testing for sequence changes and abnormal gene fusions in tumor cells was performed using the custom Children's Hospital Los Angeles OncoKidsTM panel, which is a primer-based target enrichment (AmpliSeq) next generation sequencing (NGS) based assay designed to detect diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers across a spectrum of pediatric malignancies. The DNA content of the OncoKidsTM panel consists of over 3000 amplicons and covers the full coding regions of 44 tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, hotspots for mutations in 82 genes, and amplification events in 24 genes. The RNA content includes over 1400 targeted gene fusions associated with acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, childhood sarcomas, pediatric brain tumors and soft tissue tumors (10). The sensitivity (limit of detection) of the assay, established during the “in-house” clinical validation studies, corresponds to 5% variant allele frequency (VAF) for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 10% VAF for indels. A total of 20?ng of tumor DNA and RNA, which were isolated from fresh frozen lymph node specimen or from bone marrow aspirate sample, were used for OncoKidsTM testing. Sequencing was performed using the 540 chip on the Ion Torrent S5 sequencing platform (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and downstream data analysis was conducted by Ion Reporter (Thermofisher) and an in-house custom software suite.

He also had a rapid body weight loss of 17 kg within 1 year. He denied any previous illness or contributory family history. DKA was diagnosed according to blood glucose of 592 mg/dL, blood ketone 4.3 mmol/L, and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, pCO2 28.5 mmHg, bicarbonate14.7 mmol/L). Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus was established by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 17.8%, and screening for negative glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody. Acromegaly was suspected because typical characteristics were noted including body height of 185 cm, body weight of 87 kg, coarse facial features, large fleshy nose, frontal bossing, jaw prognathism, acral overgrowth, and thickening skin. Acromegaly was confirmed by elevated GH 180.1 ?IU/mL (normal <15 ?IU/mL, equal to 5 ?g/L), IGF-1 839.5 ng/mL (normal 41–272 ng/mL for males 40–50 years of age), and prolactin 293.4 ng/mL (normal 1–18 ng/mL). Imaging studies revealed sellar enlargement with a double floor contour of the sella turcica by skull X-ray and pituitary macroadenoma (1.88 cm × 1.80 cm × 2.11 cm) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Fig. 1 ). Diabetes secondary to acromegaly was diagnosed and insulin therapy was used to control blood glucose. Transphenoidal surgical intervention was highly recommended by an experienced neurosurgeon. However, this patient refused treatment and was lost to follow-up after discharge. Unfortunately, the patient returned to our hospital due to a sudden onset of severe headache and a recurrent DKA episode 2 months later. Pituitary apoplexy was documented by sella MRI (Fig. 2 ) showing a marked hemorrhage density over the pituitary macroadenoma with interval enlargement (2.20 cm × 1.96 cm × 2.00 cm). Because there was no evidence of ophthalmoplegia or pituitary failure (cortisol 9.2 ?g/dL, TSH 0.76 ?U/mL, Free T4 0.7 ng/dL), his condition was improved by supportive care. Surgical intervention, radiotherapy, and intensive insulin therapy were well indicated and advised during a team conference by several experts, but the patient denied further treatment again without visiting our outpatient clinic. In June 2009, the patient visited our endocrine clinic due to a progressive bulging mass over the right face within 2 weeks. He presented with complications from hyperglycemia once again (blood glucose 764 mg/dL, blood ketone 3.4 mmol/L, and HbA1c 17.5%) owing to interruption of the insulin injection. He also declared that he had sought alternative traditional herb medicine within this period. A computed tomography scan displayed a soft tissue mass 6.4 cm × 4.9 cm × 4.4 cm in size over the right maxillary sinus with extensive invasion of the sinus wall, orbital floor, nasal cavity, and cheek (Fig. 3 ). B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed by biopsy. His endocrine function was assessed as serum GH > 175 ?IU/mL, IGF-1 823.10 ng/mL, and prolactin 196.4 ng/mL. Staging and further chemotherapy were suggested by an oncologist, but this patient still insisted on continuing his herbal medicine regimen. In August 2012, he visited a urologist due to an enlargement of the left scrotum, intolerable dyspnea, and general weakness. Lymphoma with advanced peritoneal and pleural carcinomatosis was identified by a serial examination. The sella MRI showed interval shrinkage of the adenoma (1.46 cm × 1.80 cm × 1.80 cm). In the meantime, his GH (78.44 ?IU/mL) and IGF-1 (449.18 ng/mL) declined and hypoglycemia became frequent. As a result of his intractable clinical respiratory failure, he died in September 2012. "
987,S0002-9378(12)01073-3,"A rare case of primary extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and appendix in the setting of endometriosis"," Case Report A 47-year-old woman, gravida 0, para 0, with severe dysmenorrhea was referred for evaluation and treatment. Her past medical history included polycystic ovarian syndrome. She had no prior surgical history. She had a family history of cancer, including her mother who had acute lymphoma, maternal and paternal grandmothers who had ovarian cancer, and a maternal cousin who had peritoneal cancer. Pelvic examination was significant for right adnexal and posterior cul-de-sac tenderness. Preoperative transvaginal ultrasound revealed small uterus and ovaries and laboratory tests including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and hormone levels were within normal limits for a postmenopausal female. The patient underwent multipuncture operative laparoscopy as previously described, 1  with removal of the uterus, cervix, bilateral ovaries, appendix, and peritoneal biopsies. Findings during the procedure included severe endometriosis, thick adhesions of both ovaries and fallopian tubes to the pelvic sidewalls (Figure 1, A), and obliteration of the posterior cul-de-sac. The appendix appeared asymmetric and adherent to the pelvic sidewall (Figure 1, B). All visible lesions, adhesions, and scarring in the pelvis and abdomen were excised during the surgery. The surgical pathology report described dense infiltrates of lymphocytes involving the right ovary (Figure 2, A), fallopian tube, appendix, and right pelvic sidewall consistent with a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Endometriosis was present in the rectosigmoid biopsy, left ovary (Figure 2, C), and left fallopian tube. The uterus was unremarkable. The peritoneal washings performed were negative for malignant cells, but demonstrated numerous histocytes, mesothelial cells, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages indicative of endometriosis. Immunohistochemical staining of the lymphocytes was positive for the B-cell lineage marker, CD20 (Figure 2, B). These lymphocytes were also positive for BCL-2. The cells were negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD43, BCL-1 (cyclin D1), and BCL-6. A marker of proliferation Ki-67 was positive in 10% of the cells. The findings were consistent with a low-grade B-cell lymphoma with features of a marginal zone lymphoma. After the surgery, a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry was performed. The results were negative for residual lymphoma. The patient underwent whole body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging at 1 week, 4 months, and 12 months after surgery; all studies showed no evidence of disease. The patient was Stage I A according to the Ann Arbor staging system modified for extranodal lymphomas. 2,3  Consultation with a hematologist/oncologist recommended close observation with PET imaging every 6 months, which could be extended to every 12 months if she had no progression of disease.

988,S1092-9134(05)00019-5,"Pulmonary lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type: report of a case with cytological, histological, immunophenotypical correlation, and review of the literature"," 2 Case report A 59-year-old woman was referred to the University of South Alabama Medical Center, Mobile, Ala, in early 1994 for the evaluation of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on a chest radiograph. She complained of shortness of breath for 4 months before admission and denied any history of cough, sputum production, or fever. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, morbid obesity, schizophrenia, and a questionable history of asthma. She had a 30-pack year history of smoking cigarettes; however, she stopped smoking 15 years previously. She had been working for an unspecified length of time making license plates. Physical exam revealed an obese female with a blood pressure of 130/88 mm Hg, pulse 100/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and a temperature of 99.1°F. Respiratory examination revealed bilateral breath sounds without crackles or wheezes. No lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly was identified on physical exam. Her initial admission laboratory data were noncontributory, including a complete blood count that revealed a white blood cell of 6.8 × 109/L with a differential of segmented neutrophils 63%, lymphocytes 33%, and monocytes 4%. The hemoglobin and hematocrit were 11.2 g/dL and 35%, respectively. Serum studies for antinuclear antibodies, ribonucleoprotein antibodies, and SM antibodies were nonreactive. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules more numerous in the right base (Fig. 1 ). Interstitial and alveolar infiltrates as well as hilar lymphadenopathy were found on computerized tomography. Pulmonary function studies showed restrictive disease. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed thickened and edematous bronchial mucosa. Bronchial brush, wash, and biopsy specimens were suspicious of lymphoma. Subsequent to these findings, open lung, hilar lymph node, and bone marrow biopsies were performed and a diagnosis of lymphoma of the MALT-type was established. The patient received 4 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone). Posttherapy, the patient was asymptomatic and with radiographic evidence of improvement. In 1996, the patient returned with acute shortness of breath and a 1-cm right breast mass that was positive for lymphoma of the MALT type on biopsy. Chest x-ray findings were consistent with recurrence of her lymphoma. The patient received 2 cycles of chlorambucil, and CHOP was reinstituted with improvement of her right breast lymphadenopathy as well as her lung changes and mediastinal adenopathy. In 1998, the patient suffered another relapse of her bilateral lung infiltrate but no adenopathy. Bronchoscopically directed biopsies, bronchial wash and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and bone marrow biopsies were performed, and the recurrence of lymphoma was confirmed. She received 3 cycles of fludarabine with resolution of her symptoms. "

991,S0145-2126(13)00182-3,Follicular lymphoma with leukemic phase at diagnosis: A series of seven cases and review of the literature," 2 Patients and methods Medical records from three institutions (Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins in Lima, Peru; Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI, USA, and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL, USA) were reviewed between 2008 and 2010 looking for patients with a pathological diagnosis of FL, an absolute lymphocyte count>4000/?L and evidence of FL cells in the peripheral blood identified morphologically. The lymphocyte count cutoff was selected based on the current definition of lymphocytosis in adults [6]. Clinical data from all cases were collected from retrospective chart review, and included age, sex, race, absolute lymphocyte count at presentation, FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score, therapeutic regimens received, outcome and overall survival (OS). Cases were reviewed by at least two hematopathologists at the respective center of diagnosis. Cases were diagnosed following criteria defined by the World Health Organization. Routinely stained slides of specimens derived from lymph nodes, bone marrow and Wright Giemsa stained slides of peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate smears were reviewed. Diagnoses were all confirmed through flow cytometric immunophenotyping and/or through immunohistochemical studies for expression of CD20, bcl2, bcl6 and CD10 as well as proliferation index by Ki-67 expression. Classic cytogenetic analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using probes for BCL2 rearrangements were used in a subset of cases. For the literature review, a literature search was performed independently by two authors (BEB, JJC) using Pubmed from January 1990 through December 2011 looking for case reports and series providing data on patients with FL with a leukemic phase. Inclusion criteria were age>18 years, pathological diagnosis of FL and absolute lymphocyte count>4000/?L. Patients with primary cutaneous FL were excluded. Two authors independently gathered pertinent clinical and pathological data (BEB, JJC). Characteristics will be presented using descriptive statistics. Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time elapsed from diagnosis to death or last follow-up. All graphs and calculations were obtained using Medcalc (Mariakereke, Belgium). "
993,S0344-0338(12)00096-9,Extra-osseous Ewing sarcoma of the thyroid gland mimicking lymphoma recurrence: A case report," Clinical history A 66-year-old man was discovered to have a single nodule on the left lobe of the thyroid gland during a follow-up positron-emitting tomography (PET) examination carried out because of his previous history of large B-cell lymphoma, which had been successfully treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, prednisone) five years before, and was still in total clinical remission. An ultrasound (US) scan revealed a 45mm, solid and heterogeneous nodule that was hypervascular upon color-Doppler investigation. The mass was neither palpable nor painful. Laboratory tests showed normal thyroid function (T3, T4, TSH), and normal anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibody levels. Because of the suspicion of a local recurrence of lymphoma, a US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy was performed using a 22G needle. "
994,S0278-2391(12)00262-5,Adult Sporadic Burkitt Lymphoma of the Oral Cavity: A Case Report and Literature Review," Report of Case In late January 2011, a 61-year-old Japanese woman presented to a local dentist with paresthesia of the lower lip and dull pain in the left mandibular posterior teeth. She was referred to Meikai University Hospital for further evaluation. Radiography showed no evidence of any organic lesion in the oral and maxillofacial area. All blood test results were within normal ranges, and testing for the human immunodeficiency virus was negative. The patient was treated with antibiotics, without any improvement of symptoms. A few weeks later, rapid swelling of the left side of the face and buccal mucosa with trismus occurred (Fig 1A, B). Panoramic radiography showed no evidence of osteolysis (Fig 2A). Computed tomography displayed an extensive soft tissue mass in the left masseter and medial pterygoid muscle (Fig 2B). There was no swelling of the regional lymph nodes, and the results of repeated blood tests, including lactate dehydrogenase, remained within normal ranges. An incisional biopsy was performed (Fig 1C). Histologic examination of the biopsy samples showed tissue-destructive, monotonous infiltration of lymphoid cells into the muscle fiber bundles (Fig 3A). These cells were medium sized with round nuclei and sparse cytoplasm, exhibiting a “starry sky” pattern at low magnification (Fig 3B, C). The nuclei of the lymphoid cells were similar in size, or smaller, than those of the histiocytes (Fig 3D). Immunohistochemistry showed that the noncleaved lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD10 (Fig 3F), CD20 (Fig 3G), CD79?, bcl-6 (Fig 3I), and Ki-67 (Fig 3J) but negative for CD3 (Fig 3E), bcl-2 (Fig 3H), CD5, CD30, CD99, desmin, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), cyclin D1, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-latent infection membrane protein-1 (data not shown). In situ hybridization also showed negativity for EBV-encoded small RNA (data not shown). These findings were histologically compatible with BL. The patient was referred to the Division of Hematology, Keio University Hospital. Another biopsy was performed, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a rearrangement of the C-MYC gene (Fig 4). In situ hybridization using the C-MYC breakpoint probe showed that 95.5% of the infiltrated lymphoid cells were positive for the C-MYC translocation. The patient was diagnosed as having BL. Repeated examinations for clinical staging showed no infiltration of BL cells into the bone marrow or cerebrospinal fluid, but right axillary lymph node swelling was observed (Fig 5).  The patient underwent 8 courses of chemotherapy consisting of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with rituximab, high-dose methotrexate, and cytarabine, which was combined with rituximab (R-hyper CVAD/HD MTX-Ara-C). Eleven months later, the patient was disease-free and showed no signs of recurrence (Fig 6A, B).  All the findings obtained using these techniques were in accordance with the diagnosis of BL. The case study protocol was reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of the Meikai University School of Dentistry (A0832). "
995,S0046-8177(04)00506-4,Transformation of hairy cell leukemia to high-grade lymphoma: A case report and review of the literature," Case report A 43-year-old man was admitted in November 1998 for evaluation of pancytopenia. On admission, the patient’s total leukocyte count was 3.2 × 109/L, with 41.9% lymphocytes, 46.5% neutrophils, 7.7% monocytes, 3.3% eosinophils, and 0.6% basophils. His hematocrit was 40.1%; hemoglobin, 13.7 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, 115 fL; and platelet count, 75 × 109/L. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly. A diagnosis of HCL was made based on a bone marrow biopsy specimen demonstrating the characteristic “honeycomb” histological pattern. A 7-day course of chemotherapy with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine was started in December 1998. Subsequently, pancytopenia became more prominent. Bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained in January and May 1999 demonstrated persistent HCL. Thirteen cycles of chemotherapy with pentostatin were initiated. A bone marrow biopsy performed after completion of the chemotherapy demonstrated no evidence of HCL. In November 2000, evaluation of another bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed recurrent HCL. Splenectomy was performed in January 2001, and the surgical specimen demonstrated extensive HCL infiltration. In March 2001, the patient began a second regimen of pentostatin, undergoing multiple cycles that ended in July 2001. Evaluation of a bone marrow biopsy specimen obtained at the completion of chemotherapy revealed no HCL. The patient continued to do well until he presented with bilateral cervical adenopathy in November 2002. Evaluation of a left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy specimen revealed HCL that had transformed to large-cell lymphoma. HCL was also identified in a bone marrow biopsy specimen obtained a week later. "
996,S1741-9409(05)00018-X,Plasmablastic lymphoma of oral mucosa type: A case report," Case report A 60-year-old white man was referred to the Oral Medicine of Odilon Behrens Hospital for investigation of a swelling in the face. Extraoral examination demonstrated asymmetric face (Fig. 1 (A)). Intraoral examination revealed an ulcerated and bleeding swelling in the upper lip. The right hard and soft palate showed a swelling covered by a yellowish membrane (Fig. 1(B)). A craniofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a presence of lesion infiltrating the parapharyngeal space, nasal fossae and right maxillary sinus (Fig. 1(C)). An incisional biopsy was performed, and the specimen fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution. Section 5?m thick was stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Microscopical examination showed a monotonous diffuse lymphoid proliferation composed by large cells. The cells presented with oval to round, vesicular nuclei with fine chromatin, 2–4 membrane bound nucleoli (centroblasts) or single centrally located nucleolus (immunoblasts). Cells with plasmablastic differentiation were observed. A “starry sky” with apoptotic bodies and macrophages was present (Fig. 1(D)). Sections 3?m thick were submitted for immunohistochemical evaluation by the streptavidin-biotin protocol. Appropriated positive and negative controls were included. The malignant cells were immunopositive for VS38c (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA, USA; clone M7077; dilution 1:50), immunonegative for CD20 (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA, USA; clone L26; dilution 1:50), CD3 (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA, USA; Clone M0835; dilution 1:50), and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA, USA; clone M3515; dilution 1:50) (Fig. 1(E)). Antigen retrieval was performed with steam-heat antigen retrieval (30min citric acid—10 mmol/L, pH 6.0). Extraction of the genomic DNA was performed from the paraffin block in accordance with protocols described by Isola et al. 9  and Mesquita et al. 11  The heavy immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (IgH) analysis was performed by a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers used have been previously described by Trainor et al. 14  and Wan et al. 16  PCR amplified DNA was electrophoresed in 2.0% agarose and visualized under ultraviolet light after ethidium bromide staining. A negative control was used for all PCR reactions. Tonsil was used as control for polyclonality. The DNA obtained of the case showed a discrete and homogenous band on electrophoresis (Fig. 1(F)). The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) genome was demonstrated by PCR. The primers used in PCR have previously described by Ammatuna et al. 2  Appropriate negative controls and positive controls were performed. The DNA obtained of the case showed a 269pb band on electrophoresis (Fig. 1(F)). The diagnosis PBL of oral mucosa type was made. The patient was HIV-negative by three ELISA-tests. The patient was treated with 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide (120mg), adriamycin (80mg), oncoxin (2mg) and prednisone (100mg), and twenty-three sections of radiotherapy with 360cGy/day. The lesions resolved and the patient remains free disease after fifteen months (Fig. 1(G) and (H)). "
998,S0385-8146(03)00126-3,Composite lymphoma arising in the parotid gland: a case report," 2 Case report The patient was a 58-year-old male with no particularly significant medical history. Clinically, Sjögren syndrome was not observed. The patient visited the department of otolaryngology with right parotid swelling of 3 months history. A well-movable tumor measuring of 2cm in diameter was detected in the lower pole region of the right parotid gland. This tumor exhibited a low echoic mass in ultrasound study, a contrast-enhanced computed tomogram showed a homogenous solid lesion. Malignant lymphoma was suspected by fine needle aspiration cytology. To obtain a definite diagnosis, lobectomy of the parotid gland was performed. Thirty days after the operation, the right subdavicular lymph nodes swelled and were excised. Both lesions in the parotid gland and the lymph nodes were histopathologically determined to be malignant lymphoma. No abnormalities were detected by thoracoabdominal CT, in an endoscopic study of the upper gastrointestinal tract, or in a bone marrow aspiration. Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma stage II AE was made. The patient was transferred to the department of haematology and underwent biweekly CHOP therapy. The patient is being followed as a complete remission. "
1005,S0901-5027(03)00353-9,Primary non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the mandible Report of a case," Case report A 45-year-old White male was admitted to our department with a previous diagnosis of “right hemimandibular osteomyelitis.” The patient had suffered from myocardial infarction 3 years before and was affected by chronic hepatitis HBV related. Six months previously he had undergone the extraction of the sixth, seventh and eighth lower right teeth, and a surgical exploration was performed with a diagnosis of “mandibular osteomyelitis.” Following antibiotic and hyperbaric therapy the condition of the patient did not improve. At our observation, there was an aching elastic and non-tender mass swelling in the right mandibular region and covered by normal mucosa, with paraesthesia of the right lower lip; no lymph node was noted on neck palpation. The panoramic radiograph showed a large radiolucent lesion with irregular margins in the right part of the mandible, computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck performed with i.v. ioded medium showed a wide osteolytic area in the right posterior part of the mandible with enhanced new-born tissue (Fig. 1 ); no presence of latero-cervical lymph node lesions was noted. An incisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia; the microscopic examination and the immunohistochemical assay showed a diffuse high grade large B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Histologically, under low power the tumor showed an infiltrative pattern in bone, growing between bony trabeculae and permeated marrow fat (Fig. 2A ). The medullar bony trabeculae showed reactive sclerosis. On high power sheets of cells with quite large nuclei were observed. The chromatin network was blast-like with one or two prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures were frequently noted, no necrosis was evident. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were strongly positive with common leukocyte antigen and CD 20 (Fig. 2B). The total body CT scan with i.v. ioded medium and the osseous scintiscan confirmed the posterior region of the mandible as the only localisation of the pathology. The patient was referred to the oncologists for the subsequent course. He was staged as an IE, diffuse high grade large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the mandible. The patient underwent six courses of systemic chemotherapy (CEOP protocol: vincristine, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, prednisone) and subsequently external beam radiation therapy (30Gy in 3 weeks). After 12 and 24 months the bone scintiscan and the CT scan of head and neck showed complete remission of the lesion with no evidence of lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease. "
1007,S0090-8258(04)00644-4,Non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma revealed by an ovarian tumor case report and review of the literature," Case report A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, was referred by the hematologist of the gynecologic unit of our University Hospital for a pelvic mass in a context of severe anemia. Her gynecological history included a right oophorectomy 5 years earlier because of an adnexal torsion. An intrauterine device was used for contraception. On admission, she was complaining of a 4-month asthenia. Besides pallor, the physical examination revealed a voluminous solid central pelvic mass. Neither liver nor spleen was palpable; no adenopathy was noted. Laboratory examinations showed a hypochromic and microcytic nonregenerative anemia with hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dl. An inflammatory syndrome with a C-reactive protein level at 80 was also noted. The electrophoresis of serum proteins revealed a monoclonal gammopathy with an IgG lambda type. The serum tumor markers were positive for CA 125: 847 UI/ml (normal range <35 UI/ml) and for CA 15.3: 44.9 UI/ml (<30 UI/ml), and negative for CA 19.9, ACE, AFP, and HCG. Chest radiograph was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous solid pelvic mass measuring 8 × 11 × 15 cm, which was reshaped by several necrotic centers, and a minimal peritoneal fluid (Fig. 1 ). The mass was driving back the bladder and the uterus, compressing the urinary tract. Splenomegaly was also noted, but no enlarged lymph nodes. After a blood transfusion, an exploratory laparotomy followed by a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a voluminous left ovarian tumor was performed. The histologic examination of a frozen section led to suspect a metastatic ovarian malignant tumor. Surgery was then completed with a total abdominal hysterectomy, total omentectomy, lymph node dissection, appendicectomy, and ablation of the parietal pelvic peritoneum. The patient also received three concentrated RBC units and two fresh frozen concentrated plasma units during surgery. Histology revealed a non-Hodgkin large B-cell lymphoma of the left ovary. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated CD30 expression by the neoplastic lymphoid cells. An important follicular lymphoid hyperplasia was noted in the other specimens. Postoperative course was uneventful. The assessment of the lymphoma after surgery included the determination of ?2-microglobulin which was elevated to 2.4 mg/dl (1.01–1.73 mg/dl). LDH levels, serology for hepatitis A, B, C, and HIV 1 and 2, and hepatic staging were normal. Serology for Epstein-Barr virus and CMV were consistent with past infections. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed some infracentimetric axillary nodes, a minimal pleural extravasation, and a passive atelectasis on the opposite side. Bone marrow aspirate examination showed no lymphomatous localization, but a bone marrow examination revealed a malignant B-cell lymphoma with both large and small cells. The patient was determined as having a clinical stage IV lymphoma, according to the Ann Arbor system. A chemotherapy treatment was administered consisting in four courses of an ACVBP regimen (combination of IV adriamycin 75 mg/m2 and IV cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m2 on day 1, and IV vindesin 2 mg/m2 with IV bleomycin 10 mg and prednisone 60 mg on days 1–5). It was associated with intrathecal methotrexate (15 mg on day 2) as prophylaxis against a neuromeningeal extension. Three months later, an isolated splenomegaly was palpable. The second line chemotherapy included two regimens of high doses of methotrexate. Because of the increase of the splenomegaly, a splenectomy and a liver biopsy were performed 2 months later. The histologic examination of both specimens showed the presence of a mixed follicular lymphoma with small and large cells. A complete remission was obtained with four courses of an IVAM regimen (combination of ifosfamide 1500 mg/m2 on days 1–5, vepeside 150 mg/m2 on days 1–3, aracytin 100 mg/m2 on days 1–3, methotrexate 3 mg/m2 on day 5, and folinic acid on days 6–9) associated with a Mabthera monoclonal antibody. It was followed by a therapeutic intensification with a BEAM regimen and an autograft of peripheral stem cells CD34+ (the protocol consists on BCNU 300 mg/m2 on day ?7, VP16 200 mg/m2 on days ?6 to ?3, aracytin 200 mg/m2 on days ?6 to ?3, melphalan 140 mg/m2 on day ?2, and autograft of peripheral stem cells on day 0), 9 months after the initial diagnosis. One year after the complete remission, no lymphomatous presence was noted, and a simple supervision is still maintained. "
1013,S0278-2391(11)01527-8,Spindle Cell Lymphoma of the Oral Cavity: A Case Report and Review of the Literature," Report of a Case A 40-year-old woman presented for evaluation of painful gingival swelling. The intraoral examination showed a multinodular gingival enlargement in the left mandibular quadrant (Fig 1). Paresthesia was present along the left inferior alveolar nerve distribution. Upon palpation, lymphadenopathy was noted in the left submandibular region. The radiographic examination showed an ill-defined, moth-eaten radiolucency in the left mandibular molar, premolar, and canine regions (Fig 2A-C). Widening of the periodontal ligament spaces was evident among the adjacent teeth. An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. The microscopic examination showed a proliferation of pleomorphic spindle-shaped and ovoid cells arranged in intersecting fascicles (Fig 3A-B). Although no osteoid production was evident, the initial impression was osteosarcoma, based on the sarcomatoid features and the apparently intraosseous origin of the lesion. However, immunohistochemical stains showed the tumor cells to be strongly and diffusely positive for CD45 (2B11 + PD7/26, 1:125; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), CD20 (L26, 1:250; Dako), and Bcl-6 (PG-B6p, 1:150; Dako; Fig 4A-C). Scattered immunoreactivity also was seen for CD10 (56C6, 1:40; Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA) and vimentin (V9, 1:2,000; Dako). The tumor cells lacked immunoreactivity for CD3 (F7.2.38, 1:100; Dako), myeloperoxidase (polyclonal, 1:4,000; Dako), multiple myeloma-1 (MUM-1) protein (BC5, 1:100; Biocare, Concord, CA), S-100 protein (polyclonal, 1:4,000; Dako), smooth muscle actin (1A4, 1:2,500; Dako), and cytokeratin (AE1/AE3, 1:400; Dako). The Ki-67 (30-9, prediluted; Ventana, Tucson, AZ) proliferation index was approximately 80%. The final diagnosis was a spindle cell variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to a hematologist/oncologist for management. Her disease was classified as Ann Arbor stage IIE (ie, involvement of 2 sites on the same side of the diaphragm), based on the involvement of the mandible and submandibular lymph nodes. The patient received 3 cycles of rituximab and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and local radiation therapy. She had no evidence of disease 1 month after completing therapy, and she will continue to be followed closely. "

Systemic symptoms are absent and the disease tends to regress spontaneously during adolescence. HV-like lymphoma (HVL) has recently been categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) of childhood. The disease has been variously designated over the years as edematous scarring vasculitic panniculitis, angiocentric cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) of childhood, and hydroa-like CTCL. 1-6  It represents a peripheral T-cell lymphoma manifested by dermal lesions in mostly sun-exposed areas. It is exceedingly rare and potentially fatal, and described mainly in children and young adults from Latin American and Asian countries. Patients present with cutaneous edema, blisters, ulcers, and scars on the face and extremities that mimic HV clinically; however, the lesions tend to be more extensive, deeper, and associated with severe scarring, necrosis, and systemic manifestations. EBV infection has been implicated in the cause of both HV and HVL. Lymphoma could represent the malignant end of a spectrum of EBV-associated HV, perhaps arising only in genetically predisposed individuals. We report the clinical and histopathologic features, including immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, of 12 cases of HVL from South America."

His estimated Phe tolerance was 275mg (34mg/kg/day) at the age of 4months. Mutation analysis of PHA gene was not performed. The patient had excellent dietary Phe control with 75% of his lifetime Phe levels within the clinic's recommended therapeutic range (120–360?mol/L; 2–6mg/dL). Psychology assessment at age 5years showed difficulty with attention and hyperactivity, but not at the degree diagnostic for ADHD. At 6years 2months he presented with a three week history of vomiting, constipation and weight loss. A palpable abdominal mass on physical exam was confirmed on abdominal CT scan as large ileo-ileocolic intussusception mass. He underwent ileocolic and tumor mass resection and side-to side ileocolic anastomosis. The tumor pathology and clinical staging was consistent with stage III intraabdominal Burkit's lymphoma [5]. Treatment was administered as per the A5961 study for mature B-cell lymphoma, Arm B4. He was hospitalized for three months during the course of his chemotherapy. Currently the patient is 9years 2months old with no evidence of Burkitt's lymphoma recurrence. The Phe control since chemotherapy has been stable with 82% of the levels within recommended therapeutic range. He manifested worsening of the hyperactivity and inattention and is on treatment with Strattera and Vyvanase. "

1036,S0145-2126(12)00262-7,Atypical presentation of anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma mimicking an articular relapse of rheumatoid arthritis in a patient treated with etanercept. A case report and literature review,"We report a case of a cutaneous anaplastic CD30+ T-cell lymphoma in a patient affected by RA in treatment with the anti-TNF? receptor etanercept. A 47-year old man with a 4-year history of RA came to our attention in August 2011. In the previous 4years, he was treated as first line therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporine; due to the occurrence of an acute pancreatitis, the patient discontinued synthetic DMARDs after 1year of treatment and started etanercept 50mg/week subcutaneously for the subsequent 3years, from March 2008 to April 2011. In April 2011, he developed a new, progressive motion limitation with erythaema and oedema localized only in the left knee; he underwent a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which showed only a synovial thickness with articular effusion. The patient underwent an arthrocentesis that proved negative. During this period, due to a concomitant pneumonia, he was forced to discontinue treatment with etanercept. In August 2011, because of a persisting left knee articular effusion with erythaema, oedema, fever, swelling and severe motion limitation the patient underwent another NMR, which reported the presence of pathological tissue (15cm×13cm×5cm) around the knee articulation without infiltration (Fig. 1 ). A cutaneous biopsy was performed in September 2011 which revealed the presence of an atypical infiltration of large lymphoid cells with anaplastic morphology; immunohistochemistry showed a CD30+, CD43+/?, EMA+/?, CD45?, ALK?, CD3?, CD5?, CD8?, CD20?, CD56? phenotype (Fig. 1). The proliferation rate, on the basis of by KI-67 expression, was 80%. A TCR ? chain gene analysis was performed in the suspect of a lymphoid T-cell malignancy and a monoclonal rearrangement was found. A diagnosis of anaplastic large T-cell ALK? lymphoma was posed. Staging procedures performed with a bone marrow trephine and whole body CT scan, resulted both negative. A stage IE bulky disease was defined according to the Ann Arbor criteria. Dose-dense combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide and prednisone (CHOEP-14) was initiated."
1038,S0899-7071(12)00012-5,An unusual Hodgkin's lymphoma case presenting with upper extremity multiple masses," 2 Case report A 33-year-old man was referred to our hospital because the masses that had appeared on his left arm 2 years ago had rapidly enlarged within the last 3 months. Upon his physical examination, a number of successive soft tissue masses were identified on the medial part of his left arm. His leukocyte count was found to be 11,200 and the neutrophile rate was 67.2% in the laboratory tests carried out at the orthopedic polyclinic. A radiologic examination was performed to determine the nature of masses palpated on the arm. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were acquired with a 1.5-T superconducting magnet. The left arm and ipsilateral axilla were imaged in a neutral supine position. Imaging was performed in the coronal, transverse, and sagittal planes. The MRI protocol consisted of T1-weighted spin-echo sequences, T2-weighted spin-echo sequences with fat suppression, and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences with fat suppression before and after intravenous injection of a gadolinium-containing contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine). On the MRI, multiple ovoid masses were observed along the upper medial part of the left arm with axillary masses. Masses were observed to be successive and parallel to neurovascular bundle at the medial part of the arm. The largest mass had a dimension of 25×35×58 mm. The masses, compared to neighboring muscle group, had mildly higher signal on T1-weighted spin-echo images (Fig. 1A), had markedly higher signal on T2-weighted spin-echo images with fat suppression (Fig. 1B), and demonstrated heterogeneous and intense contrast enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted spin-echo images with and without fat suppression (Fig. 1C, D, and E). The soft tissue masses in the ipsilateral axillary region had a similar appearance with the ones on the arm on all sequences (Fig. 1B, C, and D). In order to achieve a histopathological diagnosis, an excisional biopsy was performed on one of the masses. On the histopathological examination of the mass excised, Reed–Sternberg cells were observed, and the case was diagnosed as lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's lymphoma (Fig. 1F). It was reported that the mass excised resembled a typical lymphadenopathy with the features of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immunohistochemically, CD30 positivity was detected in neoplastic cells (Fig. 1G). Neck ultrasonography and computerized thoracic and abdominal tomography were performed to evaluate the possible additional pathologies after the diagnosis. Only mild splenomegaly was determined. Additional lymphadenopathy and different pathologic findings were not determined on the clinical examination, ultrasonography, and computerized tomography (CT). On his control MRI, taken after three chemotherapy sessions, masses had disappeared. "
1039,S2152-2650(13)00424-2,A Case of Primary Cardiac Lymphoma Showing Isolated Central Nervous System Relapse," Introduction Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is a rare subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma defined as extranodal lymphoma involving only the heart or pericardium, or both. The special location of PCL causes many clinically distinctive characteristics. The cardiac-related complications and concerns about the cardiovascular side effects of treatment hinder many effective treatment modalities. As a result, PCL is still considered a clinically fatal disease irrespective of histologic subtype. Furthermore, considering the location of the primary lymphoma, systemic relapse or dissemination is expected to occur in every part in the body. However, only 1 case of central nervous system (CNS) relapse has been reported until now. 1  We describe a case of a 62-year-old man who showed isolated CNS recurrence after surgical excision followed by 6 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin [hydroxydaunorubicin], vincristine [Oncovin], prednisolone) chemotherapy for PCL.

1040,S0959-8049(07)00519-9,"Sun exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma: A population-based, case–control study"," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study population The study population and methods have been reported in detail elsewhere. 19,20  The Institutional Review Board of the University of Nebraska Medical Center approved the study. Briefly, eligible cases of NHL included men and women between the ages of 20 and 75 years who were residing in one of the 66 counties in eastern Nebraska and had newly-diagnosed and histologically-confirmed NHL between January 1999 and December 2002. New patients with NHL were identified weekly through the Nebraska Lymphoma Study Group and area hospitals using a rapid case ascertainment system. Cases were alive at the time of initial contact with no history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or cancer. Of the 949 potential cases, 66 (7%) had died before contact and 354 (37%) were ineligible because they lived outside the study region (n =59), were too young or too old (n =285), had a previous diagnosis of cancer (n =8), or did not speak English (n =2). Of the 529 eligible cases, 387 participated in the study (73.2% participation rate). The main reasons for non-participation included subject refusal (n =92), physician refusal (n =21), subject could not be contacted (n =18), or other reasons (n =11). Controls without a history of HIV infection or cancer were randomly selected from the same geographical area as the cases by 1.5:1 frequency matching by age (five-year age groups) to cases. Eligible controls were randomly selected by a two-stage, random digit dialing, as described by Waksberg. 21  Of the 697 live eligible controls, 535 participated in the study (76.8% participation rate). The main reasons for non-participation were subject refusal (n =116), concern regarding blood collection (n =10), subject could not be contacted (n =28), or illness (n =8).   2.2 Data collection Information on non-dietary exposures was collected by telephone interview, followed by a mailed questionnaire for information on diet. Data collection for cases and controls was conducted concurrently. The telephone interview questionnaire included information on demographics, sunlight exposure, residential and water supply history, occupational history, past medical history, and family history of cancer. Information on sun exposure during the spring, summer, fall and winter was obtained from the following question: ‘Before two years ago (the date of interview), how many hours per day were you usually exposed to sunlight in the spring?’ The question was repeated for summer, fall and winter. Participants responded by quantifying the hours per day or hours per week of exposure. After the completion of the telephone interview, subjects were sent a self-administered, semi-quantitative 117-item food frequency questionnaire that was derived from the Block 1995 Revision of the Health Habits and History Questionnaire. 22  The instrument was validated against multiple diet records with correlations for most nutrients in a 0.5–0.6 range. 23  Subjects were instructed to answer the questions based on ‘usual eating habits, as an adult, before one year ago and not including any recent dietary changes’. For the current study, we combined vitamin D intake from food sources and multivitamin supplements to obtain the total dietary intake of vitamin D.   2.3 Data analysis Sun exposure in the spring, summer, and fall was divided into tertiles according to the distribution among controls. There was little variation in sun exposure during the winter and, thus, sun exposure was grouped into two categories (?median and >median). Each season was arbitrarily defined as having 91.25 days (365 days per year divided by four seasons). Total hours of sun exposure per year were then calculated by multiplying the hours of sun exposure per day in each season by 91.25 days and then summed across seasons. Total hours of sun exposure was grouped into tertiles based on the distribution among controls. Subjects who had never lived or worked on a farm as an adult were defined as non-farmers. The histological subtypes of NHL were defined according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification. 24  Six subtypes with a large enough sample size were evaluated in the current study: (1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (all types); (2) follicular lymphoma (including follicular lymphoma grades 1–3 and diffuse follicle centre lymphoma grades 1/2); (3) small lymphocytic lymphoma (including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia); (4) marginal zone lymphoma (including splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, and nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma); (5) other miscellaneous B-cell NHLs (including mantle cell lymphoma, precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and unclassified B-cell lymphoma); and (6) T-cell lymphoma (all types). The maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio (OR) 25  and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as the measure of association between sun exposure and risk of NHL. The reported p-values are two-sided. Age and sex were included in the final model because controls were frequency matched by these variables to cases in the case–control study. A family history of cancer (yes/no) was included in the model because it is a risk factor for NHL in the current study. Other potential confounders were considered based on prior knowledge of risk factors for NHL, as well as change-in-estimate criteria. 26  Factors such as tobacco use, alcohol use, and marital status were not included in the final models because they did not change the risk estimates by more than 10%. Tests for trend across the tertiles were performed by logistic regression classifying the first to third tertiles as an ordinal variable. We also tested for trend by modelling sun exposure variables as continuous variables. No meaningful differences were noted between the two methods. Therefore, we present the p-trend values derived from ordinal variables. Analysis was conducted using SAS software programs version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Care, NC, USA).  "
1050,S1083-3188(16)30292-3,Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Presenting as Bilateral Ovarian Mass in an Adolescent Girl," Case A 15-year-old postmenarcheal adolescent presented with pain in the abdomen and a mass in the abdomen of 1-month duration. She had attained menarche at the age of 14 years and was menstruating regularly before presentation. On examination she had pallor, but no palpable peripheral lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly. There was a huge mass palpable in the abdomen going into the pelvis. Ultrasonogram examination showed a large hypoechoic mass occupying the pelvis and abdomen measuring 18.5 × 10.1 × 9.8 cm in the left side of abdomen with a cystic area in the lower part. Another large hypoechoic area was seen in the right side of the abdomen measuring 13 × 10.5 × 11.2 cm. She had mild ascites and pleural effusion. Computed tomography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large intraperitoneal mass measuring 12.6 × 11.5 × 18 cm in the right side of abdomen with solid and cystic areas within the mass and showing heterogenous enhancement on postcontrast study. Another similar mass measuring 18 × 12 × 11 cm was noted on the left side extending from the lumbar region into the pelvis (Fig. 1 ). There was no evidence of calcification within the mass. Ovaries were not seen separately on both sides, which led us to diagnose the mass as ovarian. Para-aortic lymph nodes were enlarged. The tumor markers serum alpha feto protein and ? unit of human chorionic gonadotropin were normal. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was very high: 11,000 U/L. Clinically, the differential diagnoses considered were germ cell tumor and a lymphoreticular malignancy. The patient underwent ultrasound-guided trucut biopsy from the ovarian mass to make a preoperative diagnosis. The histopathological examination showed ovarian tissue infiltrated by immature lymphoid cells with vesicular round nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for leucocyte common antigen, CD79a, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt) and negative for CD5 and myeloperoxidase. The Ki-67 staining index was >95%. The picture was diagnostic of pre-B lymphoblastic lymphoma involving the ovaries. Her bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid studies were normal. Induction chemotherapy was started with the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 90 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) protocol. However, 3 months later, she developed persistent headache and lower motor neuron type facial palsy on the left side. A cerebrospinal fluid study showed infiltration by blasts. Triple intrathecal chemotherapy was started along with the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 90 high risk-protocol. Her facial palsy resolved and cerebrospinal fluid became normal. She received cranial irradiation of 24 Gy and maintenance chemotherapy for 2 years. A repeat computed tomography scan showed complete resolution of ovarian masses as well as a normal adnexa. She developed avascular necrosis of the right femoral head soon after completion of chemotherapy, which was managed conservatively. At present she is alive and in complete remission after 10 years. She has also regained normal menstrual function. "

Mononuclear cells (MNC) were purified by density gradient centrifugation with Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) at 1400g for 15min. The MNC were collected, suspended in 50ml 0.9% NaCl solution and spun at 400g for 10min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 30–50ml NaCl 0.9% and methoxalen (Synopharm, Barsbuettel, Germany), stock solution dissolved in pure ethanol at 1mg/ml, added to a final concentration of 200ng/ml. After incubation for 5min the cell suspension was transferred to a 75ml Cryocite stem cell bag (Baxter, Munich, Germany) and placed into a BIO-GENIC UV irradiation chamber (Vilber Lourmat, France). After irradiation with 2J/cm2 at 365nm the cells were collected into a 50ml syringe and reinjected to the patient within 1h.  2.1 Cell proliferation study MNC were separated as above, MOP was added and half of the cells irradiated. Irradiated and non-irradiated cells were suspended in Iscove’s MEM (Gibco, Germany) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Germany) and 10?g/ml Phytohemagglutinin-M (Boehringer, Germany). After incubation in 95 well plates at cell concentrations between 1×104/ml and 1×105/ml at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 72h cell proliferation was determined as described by the manufacturer using a Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany).   2.2 Patients The data of the patients in our clinical trial are shown in the following table. As demonstrated in Table 1  all patients suffered from high-grade cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, had a long history of prior treatments and were in progressive disease when included into our clinical trial.

1055,S1744-9049(05)00035-4,Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma presented with interstitial alveolar pattern of the lung: A case report," Case report A 54-year-old male had suffered from shortness of breath, cough with much sputum, and a low-grade fever for days. He was admitted to our hospital on 4 December 2002. Mild splenomegaly and coarse crackles and rhonchi over the bilateral lungs were noticed. But, no lymphadenopathy was found. The laboratory studies, including hemoglobin, electrolytes, and calcium level were within normal limits, except leukocytosis with 44% atypical lymphocytes and the high level of serum lactate dehydrogenase, 1237IU/L. A chest X-ray and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs showed an enlarged right paratracheal lymph node, bilateral bronchiectasis, and diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltration of the bilateral lung fields (Fig. 1a and b ). Because of unknown etiology, he received a lung biopsy. Two strips of lung tissue were obtained and showed CMV infection and atypical lymphocytosis. For further differential diagnosis between malignant lymphoma and CMV infection with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, he received a wedge resection of the right middle lobe of the lung. Macroscopically, the pulmonary specimen, measuring 2.8×1.4×0.9cm, showed a yellowish red brown and spongy soft cut surface (Fig. 1c). In microscopic examination, the lung parenchyma showed extensive, heavy infiltrates of atypical lymphocytes and the dilated vessels were completely filled with these atypical cells (Fig. 1d). Some scattered enlarged histiocytes, endothelial cells, and pneumocytes contained both intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions (Fig. 1e). In his peripheral blood smear, many lymphoid cells with multilobulated floret nuclei were found (Fig. 1f). After a series of immunohistochemical studies, the atypical lymphoid cells were positively stained for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD30, CD45RB, and CD99, but negatively for CD8, CD20, CD56, CD79a, TIA-1, and TdT. In addition, those scattered enlarged cells with intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions were positively stained by anti-cytomegalovirus anti-body. The ELISA study for HTLV-I showed positive results. Bone marrow biopsy showed the bone was free of tumor. Primary ATLL with secondary CMV infection of lung were finally diagnosed. Ganciclovir and systemic chemotherapy with etoposide, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (EPOCH) were given immediately. Unfortunately, the patient's condition worsened rapidly. Three months after diagnosis, he died of respiratory failure after the second course of EPOCH therapy. "
1059,S2352-5126(17)30144-3,Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma presenting as panniculitis," Case report A 77-year-old Iranian woman was admitted for investigation of a 3-month history of painful abdominal and inframammary subcutaneous nodules in the setting of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, known gallstones and elevated amylase, lipase, and C-reactive protein levels. She also had a history of taking warfarin for atrial flutter, previous transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy. The nodules were extremely tender to palpation and had overlying retiform purpura extending across the abdomen (Fig 1 ). Clinical differential diagnosis included panniculitis, warfarin necrosis, thrombosis/vasculitis, infection, and lymphoma. Fat necrosis was seen on ultrasound scan and was later confirmed on incisional biopsy taken from a lower abdominal nodule because of pain in the inframammary area. The specimen showed extensive fat necrosis with scant inflammation (Fig 2 ). No granulomas, vasculitis, atypical lymphoid infiltrate, or organisms were seen (Gram, periodic acid–Schiff–diastase and Ziehl–Neelsen stains were performed). Flow cytometry of the tissue was negative. The histology results were consistent with those of pancreatic panniculitis. Culture of the subcutaneous tissue grew actinomyces. Further panniculitis screening blood tests (including antinuclear antibody, double-stranded DNA, ?-1-antitrypsin, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay [Celestis Australia], complement levels, and angiotensin converting enzyme) were negative or within normal parameters. Computed tomography scan found a bulky pancreas, necrotic peripancreatic lymph nodes, and a left adrenal nodule. The patient also had B symptoms but no clinical lymphadenopathy. Amylase and lipase levels increased further, and endoscopic ultrasound scan and sampling of the pancreas did not confirm malignancy but suggested an inflammatory mass. The lymph node showed reactive changes, and flow cytometry was negative. The node cultured Escherichia, Neisseria, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus species. Significance of this mixed growth was difficult to determine, and despite broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and repeatedly negative blood cultures, fevers and elevated C-reactive protein persisted. Lactate dehydrogenase level increased from 423 U/L to greater than 1000 U/L, and a cholestatic liver picture developed followed by labile blood pressure and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. A positron emission tomography scan was planned and the original skin biopsy was reviewed. Positron emission tomography scan found extensive aorto-caval, para-aortic, and retroperitoneal lymph node uptake and avid uptake in subcutaneous areas corresponding with the subcutaneous nodules. Review of the sections found focal and subtle intravascular collections of intermediate to large lymphocytes within occasional small-caliber vessels in the reticular dermis and subcutis, away from the areas of panniculitis. The lymphocytes were hyperchromatic with slightly irregular nuclear outlines, and extension beyond vessels was not seen. Immunohistochemistry confirmed a diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, with the tumor cells positive for CD20, CD5, BCL2 (focal), BCL6 (focal), MUM1, and MIB-1 (>90%) but negative for CD3, CD10, CD23, EBER ISH, cyclin D1, and c-myc (<40%) (Figs 3 and 4  ). Galectin-3 provides potential research interest in this disease but is not typically used in routine diagnosis and was not available at our laboratory. The patient was transferred to the care of the hematology team with stage IVB IVLBCL and commenced on R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) chemotherapy. After 2 cycles, the subcutaneous nodules were almost clinically undetectable. "
1064,S2542-4548(18)30107-3,Recurrent Brachial Neuritis Attacks in Presentation of B-Cell Lymphoma,"Case series of lymphomatous infiltration of the brachial plexus are reported to most commonly occur in the setting of known non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. 7,8  However, reports of recurrent brachial plexus attacks as the presenting symptom of B-cell lymphoma are lacking. Neurolymphomatosis (NL) is defined as infiltration of the peripheral nervous system by lymphomatous cells in the setting of hematological malignancy and is most commonly seen in non-Hodgkin large B-cell lymphoma. 9-11  Typical presentations include neuropathy affecting peripheral nerves, the brachial or lumbosacral plexus, spinal nerve roots, or spinal or cranial nerves often associated with intense pain. In a recent case series of newly diagnosed intermediate/high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the relative incidence of NL was estimated to be approximately 3%. 12  In the largest detailed series describing NL, 24% of patients with NL had an initial diagnosis of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. 11  Malignant cells were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in only 40% of patients studied. 11  Of note, NL appears to be the least common initial presentation of lymphoma. 10  "

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using the following commercial antibodies: CD1a (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ), CD3 (Ventana Medical Systems), CD20 (Ventana Medical Systems), CD68 (clone PGM-1) (Dako, Kyoto, Japan), CD138 (DakoCytomation, Kyoto, Japan), IgG (DakoCytomation), IgM (DakoCytomation), S100 (Ventana Medical Systems), TTF-1 (Ventana Medical Systems), CK7 (Dako), and Ig ? and ? light chains (Ventana Medical Systems).   2.2 Electron microscopy Small pieces of tissue were subjected to electron microscopic evaluation. They were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, embedded in a few drops of epoxy resin (Epok 812; Oken, Tokyo, Japan), cut into 500-nm sections, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The grids were examined with an H-7500 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 80 kV.   2.3 Laser-capture microdissection and LC/MS The CSH and MALT lymphoma areas to be analyzed were selected via bright-field microscopy of fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections with laser-capture microdissection (LMD6000 Laser Microdissection System; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Each microdissection specimen contained an area of 50 000-80 000 ?m2, and 10-20 crystal-storing histiocytes or plasmacytoid cells in the MALT lymphoma lesion were microdissected and analyzed. Tissue samples were collected in 0.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 30 ?L of 10 mmol/L Tris/L mmol/L EDTA/0.002% Zwittergent 3-16 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Samples were heated at 98°C for 90 minutes and sonicated in a water bath for 90 minutes, after which they were digested overnight with 3 ?L of trypsin 0.1 mg/mL (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C. The raw MS data files were processed using 2 algorithms (MASCOT and X! TANDEM) to assign peptide and protein probability scores. The results were combined and assigned peptide and protein probability scores in SCAFFOLD (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) as a list of proteins based on the peptide spectra. Details of the methods are described elsewhere [7,8].   2.4 Polymerase chain reaction for detection of IGH rearrangement The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses were performed via the IGH Gene Clonality Assay (Invivoscribe Technologies, San Diego, CA) and the ABI Fluorescence Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Biopsy materials and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were used in these assays.  "
1068,S0046-8177(13)00094-4,Intranodular clusters of activated cells with T follicular helper phenotype in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma: a pilot study of 32 cases from Finland," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Definition of the nodular pattern and the “moth-eaten” pattern in NLPHL To diagnose NLPHL requires the presence of at least 1 “malignant” NLPHL nodule with CD21+ follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) [2,5]. The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections of NLPHL often show, at low magnification, a moth-eaten pattern produced within nodules by the presence of 2 distinct cell clusters, each with a distinct color—either dark blue or pale staining [4]: (1) the intranodular dark blue color is caused by the presence of clusters of densely packed, small lymphocytes with condensed nuclear chromatin structure and scant cytoplasm, and (2) interspersed are scattered, pale-staining cell clusters containing activated lymphoid cells of variable size, with dispersed or open nuclear chromatin structure, indistinct to small nucleoli, and variable amounts of pale-staining to clear cytoplasm [4].   2.2 Case selection Thirty-six cases of nodal NLPHL from 1999 through 2007 were retrieved by one of us (M.V.) from the files of the Institute of Pathology of the University Hospital of Tampere, Finland. All clinical data and the last follow-up information were obtained in January 2010 by one of the coauthors (M.V.). The institutional review boards of University Hospital of Tampere, Finland, and Frankfurt University Hospital approved this study.   2.3 Histologic review A consensus diagnosis of NLPHL was obtained, according to the current World Health Organization criteria [5]. The diagnostic H&E sections were examined by the authors (B.N.N., M.V., R.W., S.H., M.L.H.) without any clinical information. One patient did not have NLPHL, and 3 patients were excluded because of insufficient tissue in the paraffin blocks. The remaining 32 patients form the basis for this study. The following parameters were recorded in the H&E sections. (A) Architectural features, as follows: (1) the surface area occupied by the nodular pattern, the presence of FDCs (CD21), and the presence of the intranodular moth-eaten pattern produced by activated cells; (2) when present, the pale-staining clusters were critically examined for the following features: (a) number of nodules having clusters of activated cells, (b) number of clusters within nodules, (c) size of the clusters within nodules, (d) shape of the clusters, (e) boundaries of the clusters, (f) intranodular or extranodular location of the clusters, and (g) confluence of clusters. (B) Cytologic features of the activated cells within the clusters, as follows: (1) number of activated cells within clusters, (2) size of the activated cells with dispersed or open nuclear chromatin structure, (3) nucleoli size and number, (4) amount of cytoplasm of activated cells, (5) color of cytoplasm, (6) mitotic figures present within activated cell clusters, and (7) whether the activated cells and/or small cells formed rosettes around malignant cells. Within the pale-staining clusters, the presence or absence of dark staining small lymphocytes, histiocytes, epithelioid cells, and FDCs was recorded. The location of malignant cells (lymphocyte-predominant [LP] cells) [2] within and outside the nodules and their relationship with the clusters of activated cells and small lymphocytes were recorded.   2.4 Immunophenotyping by immunohistochemistry and Epstein-Barr virus–encoded RNA in situ hybridization Immunohistochemical stains were performed in the University Departments of Pathology in Frankfurt, Germany, and in Tampere, Finland, on freshly cut sections. The stains examined in each case, antibodies, dilutions, and suppliers are listed in Supplementary Table 1. All stains were performed using an automated instrument (AutostainerLink 48; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), following the manufacturer's instructions. Images were acquired using a digital slide scanner (ScanScope XT; Aperio, Vista, CA). Epstein-Barr virus–encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization was performed (EBER PNA Probe/Fluorescein; Dako Code Y5200), according to manufacturer's instructions, followed by visualization using Fast Red K5005 (Dako). Appropriate positive and negative controls were run with every case. By immunohistochemistry, approximate overall percentages of intranodular CD20+ B cells, IgD+ mantle cells, and CD3+ T cells were recorded. For all of the intranodular T cells, we estimated the percentages of small T cells (with condensed nuclear chromatin and scant cytoplasm), as well as activated cells (with open or dispersed nuclear chromatin) showing positivity for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD57, TIA-1, CD25, PD1, CXCL13, CD10, IRF4/MUM1, BCL2, and Ki-67, and calculated the median (and range) from these individual cases' percentages. The immunophenotype of the malignant (LP) cells was estimated, and the percentages of LP cells positive with CD20, PAX5, CD79?, CD75, BCL6, CD19, IgD, IRF4/MUM1, EMA, CXCL13, PD1, CD30, CD57, BCL2, CD10, CD15, and EBER were recorded. The immunophenotype of the T cells forming “rosettes” around the malignant cells was separately recorded for the 13 antibodies given above.  "
1070,S0967-5868(03)00110-3,Primary central nervous lymphoma presenting as bilateral cerebellopontine angle lesions: a rare case report," Case report A 36 year old man presented with a 10 year history of headache followed by 4 years of right sided hearing impairment with tinnitus and then one month of left sided hearing impairment, tinnitus and unsteadiness of gait. General physical examination revealed no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Chest, cardiac, skull bone and per rectal examination did not reveal any abnormality. He was conscious and oriented. Visual acuity and fields were normal. Fundus examination showed bilateral papilloedema and extra ocular movements showed bilateral mild lateral rectus palsies along with jerk nystagmus. He had a grade II right lower motor neuron type VII nerve palsy and moderate sensorineural hearing loss on the right side. VII and VIII nerves were normal on the left side. Lower cranial nerves were normal on both sides. Motor and sensory examination was normal, but he had cerebellar signs on the left side. Routine hematological parameters were within normal limits and a serological test for HIV was negative. Ultrasound study of abdomen was also normal. MRI was performed which showed bilateral cerebellopontine angle masses and also small masses in right lateral ventricle and anterior third ventricle region. All these masses were isointense on T1 (Fig. 1 ) and hyperintense on T2 weighted imaging with homogenous enhancement on administration of contrast (Figs. 2A and B ). There was obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient underwent a right sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt and 3 days later, a left sided retromastoid suboccipital craniectomy was performed. The cerebellopontine angle tumor was encountered after the cerebellum was retracted. The tumor was soft to firm, moderately vascular with a poor plane of cleavage between the tumor and brain parenchyma. Beyond this the tumor merged imperceptibly with the brain parenchyma. A partial decompression was performed and following the frozen section report resection was discontinued. All the cranial nerves (V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X) could be easily dissected from the tumor and preserved. Following surgery, the patient received ventilatory support and was then gradually weaned off and extubated. He was continued on antibiotics and corticosteroids and discharged after 2 weeks. At discharge, he was afebrile, conscious and obeying commands. He was referred to the medical oncology unit, where a complete workup for lymphoma elsewhere in the body was performed and found to be negative. The patient received 5500rad irradiation to the whole brain over 5 weeks and also combination chemotherapy. The patient was doing well at follow up 6 months later.  Pathological specimen examination The tumour tissue was fixed in buffered formalin and routinely processed. Five micron thick sections were cut for the examination. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of round cells with scant to moderate amounts of cytoplasm (Figs. 3A and B ). Nuclei were vesicular and surrounded with coarse chromatin and some of them had prominent nucleoli on staining. Immuno-histochemical staining for leucocytic common antigen and B cell markers (L26, CD20) was positive but negative for T cell markers, cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and GFAP. A final diagnosis of non Hodgkin’s lymphoma, diffuse large cell type (high grade) was made.  "
1071,S0385-8146(03)00118-4,Successful treatment of disseminated nasal T-cell lymphoma using high-dose chemotherapy and autologus peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: a case report," 2 Case report A 30-year-old man was referred to our hospital on 25 June 1999, and complainted left nasal obstruction due to a mass in the nasal cavity. On physical examinations, a friable, irregular, necrotic mass was observed in the left nasal cavity. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck showed a mass localized to the left nasal cavity, but no bony destruction (Fig. 1 ). The result of biopsy from the mass showed lymphocytic infiltration and necrotic change (Fig. 2 ). Immunohistological staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for CD8, CD4, and CD16, but negative for CD20 and CD56. The tumor was diagnosed as a T-cell malignant non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, angiocentric lymphoma in the REAL classification system [7]. The findings of laboratory tests including complete blood count, coagulation studies, and blood chemistry were normal. Serological tests for EBV antibodies showed the following titers: EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1:160, IgM 1:10, and EB nuclear antigens (EBNA) 1:160, indicative of past infection or reactivated state. CT of the chest and abdomen and gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no other mass. No malignant cells were found on bone marrow aspiration. Thus, the work-up confirmed that the disease was localized to the left nasal cavity, and was classified in Ann Arbor stage I and low risk group defined by the International Prognostic Index [8]. "
1080,S0090-3019(03)00650-5,Cerebello-Pontine angle (CPA) lymphoma with perineural extension into the middle fossa: case report," Case report A 21-year-old woman presented with an 11-month history of progressive right facial droop, right-sided hearing loss, right eye irritation, and 3-weeks duration of headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Neurologic examination revealed a frank right facial palsy (House-Brackmann Grade 4) and moderate degree of hearing loss on the right (Gardner-Robertson Grade 2). Conjunctival injection of the right eye was present. Further examination revealed dysesthesias in a V2 and V3 distribution. Lower cranial nerves were intact. A nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large lobulated hyperdense mass that seemed to originate from the right tentorium, extending both supratentorially and infratentorially into the right middle fossa and right cerebello-pontine angle, respectively (Figure 1  A). The mass enlarged the right internal auditory canal and right facial nerve canal, and caused some bony dehiscence along the petrous bone anteriorly (Figure 1 B). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) these extra-axial masses were mildly hypointense on T1-weighted sequences (Figure 2)  and markedly hypointense on T2-weighted sequences (Figure 3).  On the lower axial T2-weighted image, the tumor obliterated the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space in the right internal carotid artery (IAC). Only a small amount of peritumoral edema was present. Intravenous gadolinium produced slightly heterogeneous enhancement of the bilobed mass divided by a thickened tentorium (Figure 4).  The tumor caused marked mass effect on the brain stem, middle cerebellar peduncle, and adjacent cerebellum. On the basis of imaging, a differential diagnosis of meningioma and facial schwannoma was considered preoperatively. Cerebral angiography was performed for possible embolization in preparation for surgery, but the tumor was distinctly hypovascular. A right retrosigmoid posterior fossa craniotomy was performed under 40× microscopic magnification. A large, soft, purplish mass was found to be anterolateral to the cerebellar hemisphere, and it seemed to infiltrate along the nerve bundles into the internal auditory meatus. The tumor was relatively avascular, but tightly adhering to the dura. This mass was debulked with difficulty because of tight adhesions to the dura and cerebellar hemisphere by fibrous strands. Finally, the tumor was removed from surrounding structures except for the 7th and 8th cranial nerves, which were entirely enmeshed within the tumor. The frozen section was suggestive of a blue cell tumor. Intraoperatively, the middle fossa mass was found to be a separate lesion with no connection to the CPA mass through the tentorium or the incisura. Postoperatively the patient's hearing and facial palsy were unchanged. The facial dysesthesias were gone and the headache was substantially improved. No additional neurologic deficits were incurred. Histologic examination, including flow cytometric analysis, was consistent with B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma with extensive involvement of nerves and ganglia (Figure 5).  CSF cytology, bone marrow biopsy, chest CT, abdominal CT, and pelvic CT revealed no evidence of lymphoma. The HIV antibody test was negative. "

These constitute less than 1% (0.8%) of 617 FL cases diagnosed at our institution during this period. Cases of FL with marginal zone differentiation or with plasmacytic differentiation but without prominent Dutcher bodies were noted; however, they were excluded from this study. A search for LPL in the past 5 years was conducted to collect cases of nodal/splenic LPL for histopathologic comparison (13 cases). Twenty cases of nodal or splenic MZL were also randomly selected for comparison.   2.2 Histologic and immunohistochemical studies Lymph nodes and other tissues were fixed in formalin. All specimens were processed routinely, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Four-micrometer sections from paraffin-embedded blocks were immunostained with each antibody: CD20 (1:200; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), CD21 (1:20; DAKO), CD23 (1:40; DAKO), CD79a (1:100; DAKO), PAX5 (1:50; Biocare Medical, Concord, CA), CD3 (1:100; Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), CD5 (1:40; Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, England), CD43 (1:3,000; D-B Pharm, Saint-Amant-Tallende, France), CD10 (1:25; Novocastra), BCL6 (1:20; DAKO), BCL2 (1:50; DAKO), CD138 (1:100; DAKO), MUM1 (1:50; DAKO), ? light chain (polyclonal antibody; DAKO), ? light chain (polyclonal antibody; DAKO), immunoglobulin (Ig) M (RTU; DAKO), IgG (RTU; DAKO), IgA (RTU; DAKO), IgD (RTU; DAKO), cyclin D1 (1:50; Lab Vision), and Ki-67 (1:50; DAKO) using the streptavidin-biotin complex method. The corresponding positive and negative control slides for each antibody stain were carefully examined for quality assurance. All the slides were reviewed and retrospectively evaluated by 2 authors (E. W. and M. S.). The neoplastic growth pattern, cytomorphology, enumeration and distribution of cells containing Dutcher bodies, and monocytoid or plasmacytoid differentiation were evaluated on H&E-stained sections. Immunohistochemical stains were reviewed with a focus on the immunophenotypic features of cells containing Dutcher bodies, particularly expression of CD20, CD10, BCL6, MUM1, CD138, and Ig light- and heavy-chain isotypes.   2.3 Flow cytometric analysis Four-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed per routine leukemia/lymphoma panel protocols as described previously [31].   2.4 Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization As described before [31], all interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using the Vysis probes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA). Briefly, dual-color, dual-fusion probes were used for the IGH/BCL2 fusion gene; dual-color “break-apart” probes were used for the BCL6 or MALT1 rearrangement; and rearrangement of IGH gene with a non-BCL2 gene locus was deduced by an extra IGH probe signal (green color) without evidence of IGH/BCL2 fusion (yellow color) in the FISH assay for IGH/BCL2.

Patients with prior or concurrent evidence of systemic lymphoma were excluded. All patients underwent a systemic work-up including chest radiographs and/or computerized scan (CT), abdominal and pelvic ultrasound and/or CT, bone marrow biopsy. We retrospectively analysed the patients charts. Data collected included the age and sex of the patient, personal history of autoimmune disorders, cancer, AIDS or immunosuppressive therapy, symptoms, signs and Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score at time of diagnosis, preoperative assessment, surgical procedure(s), pathological findings, chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic treatments, clinical and radiological follow-up and final outcome at the time of study closure. The patients were admitted to the hospital with neurological symptoms suggesting an intracranial mass. All patients underwent radiological brain examination by CT scan (27 patients) and/or MRI (27 patients). Angiography was performed in three patients. The histopathological diagnosis was achieved on tumour material obtained at surgery in 30 cases, on CSF cytological examination in one case, and by strong evidence by sequential radiological examinations in one patient who showed significant tumour shrinkage under corticotherapy. The histological classification predominantly used was that of the World Health Organization. "

We provide a summary of the currently available literature of cases of BL during pregnancy which provides evidence that prompt treatment with aggressive multiagent chemotherapy is the best approach in these patients. Unfortunately, such chemotherapy is notorious for inducing infertility. We present 2 cases in which pregnant women underwent successful treatment of BL and maintained their fertility, suggesting that perhaps the pregnant state is protective against chemotherapy-induced infertility.

1103,S1092-9134(12)00102-5,Plasmablastic lymphoma in pediatric patients: clinicopathologic study of three cases," 2 Discussion Non Hodgkin lymphoma represents approximately 10% of all malignancies occurring in children between the ages of 5 to 19 years of age. These tumors account for approximately 60% of all lymphomas diagnosed in children and adolescents. The spectrum of NHL in pediatric patients comprises B and T cell tumors which are predominantly inclusive of high grade lymphomas such as Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and DLBCL [2,3]. Most PBLs occur in immunocompromised patients and this tumor represents a particularly aggressive NHL with a poor prognosis. The first report of PBL dates back to 1978 when Banks et al published a case report of an extramedullary lymphoid neoplasm displaying morphologic features of DLBCL of “immunoblastic sarcoma” type. This neoplasm was recognized as unique by the lack of immunohistochemical expression of B-cell surface markers and concomitant cytoplasmic expression of immunoglobulin (IgG) leading to recognition of a malignant lymphoma of plasmablastic identity [4]. Subsequently, in 1997, the term PBL was coined by Delecluse et al [5], following the description of an AIDS-associated B-lineage lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation which occurred in the oral cavity of 16 adult patients. The incidence of PBL accounts for approximately 2.6% of all AIDS-associated NHL [6]. Other high-grade lymphomas included in this group include primary effusion lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and DLBCL [4,7]. Most PBL publications derive from adult patients, particularly those afflicted with HIV infection. Topographic sites of involvement may include the oral cavity, jaw and extra-oral regions as nasal, paranasal, lung, stomach, and cutaneous regions [8-11]. Furthermore, PBL has also been reported to occur in HIV negative adult patients [12-15]. In contrast, PBL is very rarely reported in pediatric patients. Colomo et al [16], Chabay et al [17], and Radhakrishnan et al [18],. have provided rare reports of PBL occurring in pediatric patients with immunodeficiency due to HIV infection. Subsequently, Gogia and Bakhshi [19] have reported the particularly rare occurrence PBL in the oral cavity of an HIV-negative patient. Similar to the adult counterpart, there is a propensity for PBL to occur in pediatric patients afflicted by HIV infection, as evident in all our patients. The CD4 counts were assessed in all patients (221, 237, and 592 cells/mm3), and although all 3 patients received HAART, only the last of three received HAART before the diagnosis of lymphoma. This accounts for the relatively high CD4 count (at diagnosis) which was evident in our third patient. Typical plasmablastic morphology with plasmacytic differentiation was present in all these tumors and there was plasma cell immunophenotypic reactivity (Vs38C, MUM1, EMA, and CD138). No CD20, ALK, or HHV-8 immunoexpression was demonstrated. The tumor proliferation indices typically ranged from 80% to 95%, and 2 of 2 cases tested displayed weak to moderate LCA (CD45) immunoreactivity. PBL generally lacks LCA and CD20 expression. However, expression of LCA is not an overtly uncommon finding in PBL. Delecluse et al [5] demonstrated weak surface membrane expression of CD20 and LCA in a proportion of PBL tumor cells. In further support thereof, Colomo et al [16] found weak expression of CD45/LCA in 61% of PBLs (oral mucosa type) and 56% of PBLs with plasmacytic differentiation. In the latter study, weak expression of CD20 in 8% to 13% of cases of PBL was also established. Furthermore, in a case report by Guan et al [14] focal LCA expression was found in PBL occurring in the oral cavity of an HIV-negative patient. All 3 of the PBL tumors lacked EBV LMP1 immunoreactivity. However, in 1 of 3 cases tested, EBER ISH positivity was present in tumor cells. This is supportive of the interesting finding by the Rochford et al [20] having observed that EBER positive EBV infection, without detectable LMP-1, was associated with plasmacytic differentiation in EBV-infected B-cell lines. EBV infection plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PBL and EBV-positivity is demonstrable in the vast majority (60-100%) of PBLs by in situ hybridization. However, detection of expression of EBV latency-associated proteins such as latent membrane protein-1 by immunohistochemistry is known to occur less often [1,10,21,22]. In adult patients, PBL may arise in the setting of multicentric Castleman's disease in association with HHV-8 infection. Dupin et al demonstrated the presence of HHV-8 infection by HHV-8 latent nuclear antigen 1 immunohistochemistry in 8 patients within multicentric Castleman's disease. Three of their patients subsequently developed PBL [23]. In support thereof, Oksenhendler et al. confirmed the development of PBL in 6 patients with HIV infection and multicentric Castleman's disease. HHV-8 latent nuclear antigen-1 was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in 3 of these cases [24]. Even in the absence of multicentric Castleman's disease, some investigators have reported the finding of HHV-8 infection in cases of PBL. Cioc et al demonstrated HHV-8 infection by immunohistochemistry and real time in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 4 cases of PBL occurring within the oral region (oral cavity and oro/nasopharynx) [25]. Deloose et al subsequently confirmed the presence of HHV-8 infection by PCR and immunohistochemistry in 10 of 26 cases of DLBCL occurring in HIV infected patients. These cases constituted a distinctive subgroup of DLBCL with immunoblastic/plasmablastic morphology, CD138/syndecan immunoexpression and low/absent expression of B-cell markers such as CD20, PAX5, and CD79a. All of these tumors were located predominantly within the gastrointestinal tract and there was no associated history of multicentric Castleman's disease [26]. Although Dong et al found low levels of HHV-8 DNA by nested PCR in 6 of 10 cases of PBL, immunohistochemistry for HHV-8 latent nuclear antigen was negative in all the tumor cells. Two of the patients included in their study had concomitant Kaposi's sarcoma and timorous ascites. They concluded that the HHV-8 DNA detected by PCR was most likely due to the presence of infected bystander circulating (non neoplastic) lymphocytes [27]. Moreover, Colomo et al demonstrated a lack of HHV-8 infection in 19 cases of PBL of oral mucosa type and 11 cases of PBL with plasmacytic differentiation using HHV8 immunohisochemistry and/or PCR [16]. All 3 cases in our study lacked HHV-8 latent nuclear antigen-1 immunoexpression. Histopathological confirmation of PBL requires exclusion of other tumors which display plasmablastic features. ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma is one of several tumors which may display plasmablastic morphology and an immunophenotype which overlaps with PBL. Although expression of EMA and plasma cell markers such as CD138 and VS38C may be present, this tumor is typically characterized by granular cytoplasmic ALK protein expression. Plasmablastic morphology may also be seen in primary effusion lymphoma and extracavitatory variants thereof. These are distinguished from PBL by consistent immunoexpression of CD45/LCA and concomitant association with both HHV-8 and EBV. Immunoblastic variant of DLBCL may be considered in the differential diagnosis and the immunoprofile is typified by strong diffuse LCA and CD20 expression [28-31]. Plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) may be considered in the differential diagnosis of PBL. However, PCN are very rare in pediatric patients. Depending on the subtype, PCN may be defined by bone marrow infiltration by neoplastic plasma cells, bone or soft tissue lesions, M protein in serum or urine, renal dysfunction, anemia, and/or hypercalcemia [28]. The plasmacytoid variant of Burkitt lymphoma may also be considered in the differential diagnosis. These tumours display cytoplasmic basophilia, eccentric nuclear displacement and prominent centrally located nucleoli. The immunophenotype includes LCA, CD20, CD10 and Bcl6 immunoexpression [32]. The diagnostic characteristics in all our cases of pediatric PBL includes background HIV infection, low CD4 counts, blastic morphology intermixed with plasmacytic differentiation, immunoexpression of plasma cell markers, lack of HHV-8, EBV LMP1, ALK, and very high tumor proliferation indices. PBL is an aggressive malignancy with particularly poor outcome in the setting of concomitant HIV infection. The combination of cognizance of this rare tumor in the pediatric population coupled with antiretroviral therapy (which precedes the diagnosis of lymphoma) and prompt initiation of aggressive multimodality treatment may, in future, facilitate improved outcome in pediatric patients with PBL.

The patient originally started having nausea and dizziness approximately 2 months prior to admission and stopped taking Cymbalta at his Neurologist’s recommendation. The symptoms did not subside and he later developed diplopia causing him to go to the ED. A non-contrast head CT revealed no abnormalities and the patient was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. The patient’s diplopia, however, continued to worsen and an MRI was obtained which showed a right medullary CVA. The patient was then referred for outpatient therapy in our clinic. During his examination by the attending physiatrist, he was deemed to be a good candidate for acute inpatient rehabilitation and admitted to the service. The patient’s diplopia and gait dysfunction initially remained stable. Over the next few days, however, he noted worsening ataxia and diplopia and developed dysphagia. An MRI was ordered which showed large masses in the third and fourth ventricles with surrounding edema in the brainstem and cerebellum. Neurology, Hematology/Oncology, Neurosurgery, and Radiation Oncology consults were obtained. The patient was transferred to the Medicine service for further care. "

Cerebrospinal fluid was notable for lymphocyte predominance (98%) with large atypical cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive cervical and thoracic myelitis. Physical examination revealed a large palpable cervical neck mass, brisk reflexes, and sustained bilateral lower extremity clonus. A 5-day course of immunoglobulins and methylprednisolone yielded minimal improvement. Repeat MRI demonstrated abnormal hyperintensity in the cord from C6-C7 to T11-T12 with multifocal areas of enhancement. Cervical mass biopsy and flow cytometry revealed an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder. Plasmapheresis initially improved his lower extremity strength. Positron emission tomography (PET CT) showed lymphadenopathy without osseous, marrow, or abdominal involvement. A working diagnosis of paraneoplastic transverse myelitis secondary to lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin’s lymphoma was established. Treatment consisted of systemic steroids, 4 cycles of intravenous rituximab, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone. He received these treatments alongside 21 weeks of acute inpatient rehabilitation. "

Physical examination revealed bilateral neck and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Abdominal ultrasonography disclosed mild hepatomegaly, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and a moderate amount of ascites. Examination of the peritoneal fluid obtained by paracentesis revealed leukocytosis which appeared atypical to a great extent. A small amount of right-sided pleural effusion was detected. Laboratory studies demonstrated an elevated white blood cell count of 11,000/mm3 with lymphocytosis of 25%, including the atypical forms (Fig. 1 ). Hepatocellular and ductal enzymes were elevated (alanine aminotransferase, 312 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase alanine, 411 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase, 939IU/L; and the lactate dehydrogenase 445 IU/L (normal, 10–37). All the serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Subsequent serological tests for EBV yielded the following results: a viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titer of 1:80, a VCA IgM titer of 1:40, an early antigen titer of less than 1:10, and a nuclear antigen titer of less than 1:10. Bone marrow aspiration from the sternum disclosed hypercellular bone marrow with 1.6% atypical lymphocytes, but there was no clear evidence of lymphoma. Ascites and liver dysfunction disappeared with resolution of acute IM. The patient was given no further treatment, and she was well at the last follow-up 10 months later. "
1112,S0090-3019(02)01046-7,Primary malignant lymphoma of the trigeminal region treated with rapid infusion of high-dose MTX and radiation: case report and review of the literature," Case report A 55-year-old Japanese male presented with a 3-month history of left facial pain in all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. He experienced severe facial pain and was hospitalized at our facility. Though neurologic examination on admission revealed only left trigeminal pain, left-side lower cranial nerve and bilateral oculomoter palsy progressed very shortly after hospitalization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass lesion in the left side of Meckel’s cave, with extension into the cerebellopontine angle and the infratemporal fossa through the foramen ovale (Figure 1A, B ).  The mass lesion, isointense on T1- and T2-weighted MR images, was homogeneously enhanced with gadolinium. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no erosive changes of the bone. The first presumptive diagnosis on admission was trigeminal schwannoma, based on MR and CT images [14] and clinical symptoms. However, the fact that the patient presented with rapidly progressing and radiologically inexplicable neurologic defects, such as lower cranial nerve palsy and untreatable trigeminal neuralgia, suggested cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) dissemination of some kind of malignant tumor. We performed a lumbar puncture and identified many large abnormal cells. To confirm the diagnosis we performed surgery. The mass lesion at the cerebellopontine angle was biopsied via the lateral-suboccipital approach. The trigeminal nerve was swollen to a large extent and surrounded by reddish granuloma-like tissue (Figure 1C ). This tissue was removed at the entry zone to Meckel’s cave, and some of the trigeminal nerve was resected. Tissue from the nerve showed a mass of neoplastic cells; remnants of neuronal fiber were recognized (Figure 2A ).  Tissue from the granuloma-like lesion showed massive and concentrated invasion of abnormal cells (Figure 2B ). The specimen was studied immunohistochemically. Many of the cells reacted with CD79? antibody, suggesting that the mass lesion was malignant B cell lymphoma (diffuse large cell type). The Ki-67 staining index was 29%. To determine the primary site, the patient underwent chest and abdominal CT scans and Ga-scintigram. The results indicated no active lesion. As the patient complained of lower extremity pain a few days after surgery, spinal dissemination was suspected; spinal MR imaging showed enhanced lesions in the lumbar region. The final diagnosis was primary malignant lymphoma of the trigeminal nerve with CSF dissemination. The patient was treated with rapid high-dose MTX chemotherapy [13] for 3 cycles at 2-week intervals, followed by radiation therapy of whole brain (30Gy), local region (20Gy), and whole spine (27Gy). No corticosteroid hormone was administered. MTX concentration in the CSF was 17.5 mM at 6 hours after IV infusion of 100 mg/kg/3 hour MTX. During infusion, hydration and urine alkalinization were performed to prevent renal failure. After infusion, the patient underwent leucovolin rescue for 3 days. Although no complications, including renal and liver disfunction and myelosuppression, were observed during and after MTX therapy, low WBC count was observed after spinal radiation, requiring G-CSF injection. Cranial nerve symptoms excepting neuralgia all improved remarkably within MTX therapy, and intracranial mass lesion was almost undetectable on MRI after the full course of rapid high-dose MTX therapy. However, the mass lesion at the infratemporal fossa still remained, suggesting partial response. At 2 weeks after all treatment, including radiation, MRI detected no enhanced lesion either in brain or spine. CSF study revealed no abnormal cells. The total treatment outcome was complete remission. The patient was discharged with no cognitive loss or memory disturbance 4 months after admission. The patient was then followed up for 14 months, until he was found collapsed in his house. Severe brain damage, presumably from seizure, was observed. Though no local recurrence was noted, an MRI revealed enhancement all over the cortex, and recurrence of CSF dissemination was suspected. He died shortly after from multiple organ failure. "
1114,S0303-8467(13)00309-0,An uncommon case of epidural plasmablastic lymphoma presents as spinal cord compression," 2 Case report A 59-year-old Chinese woman had complained of pain in her chest and back for 2 months. The pain was localised, dull, and persistent. Analgesics alleviated the symptoms. One month after the onset, she felt numbness underneath her collarbone and simultaneous weakness in her feet. She was ambulatory without assistance until 2 days before presentation to our clinic. She had no problems with urination or defecation. Physical examination was negative for lymphadenopathy. Neurological examination showed a decreased pinprick sensation in the trunk below the collarbone. Her muscle strength was 4/5 in the lower extremities. Both superficial and deep tendon reflexes were normal. Pathological signs were absent. Computed tomography (CT) of her vertebrae showed no bone destruction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine revealed spinal cord compression at the C5–T1 level. A discus-like lesion was located posterior to the spinal cord and showed an isointense signal on T1- and T2-weighted images (Fig. 1A and B). After injection of an intravenous contrast agent, the lesion was homogeneously enhanced with a typical mouse tail sign (Fig. 1C). The patient underwent laminectomy and spinal cord decompression. After removal of the vertebral plate, a lesion was exposed in the epidural space. The lesion was fleshy, vascular, and loosely adhered to the dura. The lesion was completely excised from the dura. Exploration of the subdural space revealed no lesion, and the spinal cord restored pulsation. Histopathological examination of the spinal mass revealed large tumour cells with mostly centrally located nuclei. There were one or more nucleoli in the nuclei. Frequent mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies were observed. Well-differentiated plasma cells were also present. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD138 and Mum-1 with sparse weak positivity for CD3, CD5, and PAX5. Staining was negative for ALK, BCL-6, CD10, CD20, and CD30. The proliferation index by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry exceeded 70% (Fig. 2A–F). Tests for HIV and EBV were both negative. PET-CT revealed no nodular hypermetabolic regions. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy demonstrated locally increased plasma cells. Immunohistochemical staining displayed CD138 (+), Mum-1(+), CD38(?), CD3(?), and PAX-5(?). Therefore, PBL was diagnosed. One week after the operation, the patient's pain and numbness were relieved and she was able to walk by herself. Post-operative MRI showed that the epidural neoplasia was totally removed, and the spinal cord was thoroughly decompressed (Fig. 1D). She was then transferred to the haematology department for chemotherapy. The chemotherapy protocol was the CHOP regimen plus Bortezomib. After five cycles of chemotherapy, she was evaluated by the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). The KPS score was 60. "

He presented with nonspecific complaints of fatigue and vomiting for 2 weeks and had one episode of syncope prior to hospital admission. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large heterogeneous right atrial mass protruding through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle (Fig. 1) . During surgery, a solitary and pedunculated intracavitary mass was found in the right atrium, attached via a stalk to the medial aspect of right atrium and superior vena cava junction (Fig. 2) . Using femoral venous and superior vena caval cannulation, the mass was successfully resected with adjacent portions of right atrium and superior vena cava. Good macroscopic margins were obtained. The remaining defect was reconstructed with autologous atrial tissue. No other masses or enlarged lymph nodes were present. After surgical resection and final pathologic diagnosis of B-LBL, patient was treated with chemotherapy. He is well and in complete remission a year after initial diagnosis. "

Separation of these two patterns does not have any prognostic significance; however, pattern recognition is important in differentiating this tumor from other tumors with intense lymphocytic infiltrates.3 "
1122,S2152-2650(13)00174-2,Rituximab-Induced Acute Severe Thrombocytopenia: A Case Series in Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma," Introduction Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a form on B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and by World Health Organization criteria is sub-classified as intermediate type. Mostly affecting patients in their fifth or sixth decade, it carries the worst prognosis of all B cell NHL. Treatment involves aggressive chemotherapy regimen along with rituximab with a goal to achieve complete remission followed by autologous stem cell transplant in eligible patients. Addition of rituximab in the treatment of NHL has made a significant impact in overall response and survival. Mostly well tolerated, rituximab toxicities are mainly infusion related hypersensitivity reactions. Cytopenias are the described hematological toxicities and they usually occur 10 – 14 days following rituximab infusion. We present this case series as a single institution experience of a unique side effect of acute severe thrombocytopenia following rituximab infusion during treatment of patients with MCL.  Case Reports Patient 1: A 63-year-old Caucasian woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented with symptoms of abdominal pain and night sweats. She was diagnosed with stage IV MCL with involvement of the bone marrow, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and rituximab was poorly tolerated because of a severe infusion reaction, and she was transferred to the West Penn Cancer Institute for further management. She subsequently received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin (Schaumburg, IL), methotrexate, cytarabine, and dexamethasone (R-HyperCVAD). A complete blood count (CBC) before rituximab infusion showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.99 K/?L, hemoglobin (Hbg) level of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 133 K/?L. She experienced a minimal infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction to rituximab, which resolved promptly with administration of acetaminophen and steroids. A CBC drawn 24 hours after rituximab infusion showed WBC count of 7.64 K/?L, Hgb level of 7.4 g/dL, and a critically low platelet count of 5 K/?L. She had no bleeding complications and required 2 days of platelet transfusion, followed by spontaneous recovery of the platelet count to 56 K/?L by post-infusion day 5 and a return to the baseline platelet level of 134 K/?L by day 8. She had a similar episode during her second cycle with a pre-infusion platelet count of 149 K/?L decreasing to 5 K/?L 24 hours after rituximab infusion. She had no bleeding complications and required platelet transfusion for 2 days followed by spontaneous recovery by day 4 to a platelet count of 36 K/?L. She then developed pancytopenia that was considered secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Subsequently she received bortezomib with rituximab without further episodes of acute severe thrombocytopenia. Patient 2: A 72-year-old male was presented with dyspnea, fever, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Biopsy and staging revealed stage IV MCL with bone marrow involvement and splenomegaly. Extensive comorbidity precluded aggressive chemotherapy, and he received bendamustine and rituximab. A CBC before rituximab infusion showed WBC count of 26.26 K/?L, Hgb level of 9.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 33 K/?L. He tolerated rituximab infusion well without any infusion-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. A CBC within 24 hours of infusion showed WBC count of 5.73 K/?L, Hbg level of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 10 K/?L. His acute thrombocytopenia did not result in any bleeding complications, and he received a platelet transfusion for 2 days. This was followed by spontaneous platelet recovery to pre-treatment levels by day 5 to 28 K/?L. Subsequent treatment with rituximab did not result in any further complications of acute thrombocytopenia. He remains in complete remission after 4 cycles of bendamustine and rituximab. Patient 3: A 60 year old Caucasian male was presented with splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. He underwent supraclavicular lymph node and bone marrow biopsy and was diagnosed with MCL stage IV. Calculation of the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) revealed intermediate risk disease. He received 1 cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone without any side effects and was then referred to the West Penn Cancer Institute for further management. Given his stage and risk status, he was started on the R-HyperCVAD regimen. A CBC before rituximab infusion showed WBC count of 12.32 K/?L, Hbg level of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 146 K/?L. He also tolerated rituximab infusion well without any hypersensitivity reactions. Post-infusion blood work showed progressive thrombocytopenia. A CBC after 3 days showed WBC count of 3.86 K/?L, Hbg level of 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 74 K/?L, with thrombocytopenia reaching a nadir of 11 K/?L on the seventh post-infusion day. He had no bleeding complications and required only 2 days of platelet transfusion. Although the decrease in platelet count seemed to be more subacute, we decided to include this case because there was no other reasonable explanation for his thrombocytopenia. Subsequent chemotherapy cycles with rituximab did not result in acute thrombocytopenia. He achieved a good partial response and underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patient 4: A 64 year old Caucasian female was diagnosed with stage IV MCL after she presented with symptoms of night sweats and shortness of breath. She had involvement of the bone marrow, leukemic phase, and splenomegaly. She was started on the R-HyperCVAD regimen. A mild infusion-mediated reaction with rituximab resolved with medications and a slower infusion rate. Pre-infusion blood counts showed WBC count of 13.07 K/?L, Hgb level of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 91 K/?L. A CBC drawn 24 hours after rituximab infusion showed WBC count of 6.18 K/?L, Hgb level of 8.5g/dL, and a decrease in platelet count to 3 K/?L. She received platelet transfusion for 2 days and did not have any major bleeding complications. Her subsequent cycle with rituximab was uneventful without any thrombocytopenia complications. She achieved complete remission after 2 cycles of chemotherapy and underwent successful autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patient 5: A 76 year old Caucasian male was diagnosed with stage IV MCL with involvement of bone marrow and splenomegaly after workup of his chronic but slowly progressing lymphocytosis. He was started on chemotherapy with bendamustine and rituximab. A CBC before his first rituximab infusion showed WBC count of 20.44 K/?L, Hbg level of 14.1g/dL, and platelet count of 122 K/?L. He developed an infusion-mediated hypersensitivity reaction requiring a slower infusion rate to complete his treatment. A 24-hour post-infusion blood sample showed WBC count of 8.81 K/?L, Hbg level of 13.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 26 K/?L. The acute thrombocytopenia did not result in any bleeding complications and did not meet the threshold criteria for platelet transfusion. This episode of acute thrombocytopenia was followed by spontaneous recovery of the platelet count to 61 K/?L by post-infusion day 4 and to 134 K/?L by day 7, equal to the pre-infusion level. The patient characteristics and platelet count trends are summarized in Table 1  and Figure 1 .  "
1134,S2212-5345(12)00083-4,A case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with rapid progression of pulmonary areas of ground-glass attenuation and multiple nodules," 2 Clinical findings A 48-year-old Japanese male began to experience a dry cough in January 2010. He had previously been treated for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was a current smoker (20 pack-years) and was not exposed to any toxic materials. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) performed during a medical checkup revealed abnormally high uptake of FDG bilaterally in the axillary lymph nodes, and he was initially referred to the Center for Cancer Chemotherapy and Hematology in our hospital in May 2010. His peripheral blood findings included a high proportion of atypical lymphocytes (including 10% flower cells) and HTLV-1 antibody positivity, and he was therefore diagnosed with chronic ATL. Chest radiography showed no remarkable abnormal findings, but chest computed tomography (CT) revealed several fine nodular opacities bilaterally in the lower lobes and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. He was initially followed closely without any treatment, but his symptoms of dry cough, exertional dyspnea [British Medical Research Council dyspnea scale grade 3], and fever (over 38°C) worsened in early August, 2010. Chest CT performed at that time showed bilateral pulmonary areas of GGA with small nodules, and the patient was referred and admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine for evaluation and treatment. Upon admission (Day 1), the patient exhibited a blood pressure of 134/80mmHg, SpO2 of 92% (room air), pulse rate of 83 beats/min (regular), and body temperature of 37.4°C. Late-inspiratory fine crackles were audible bilaterally in his lower lung fields on physical examination. His laboratory findings at admission ( Table 1) were as follows: peripheral blood white blood cell count=18,900/mm3 (50% neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes and 24% atypical lymphocytes), AST=28IU/L, ALT=18IU/L, Na=140mEq/L, K=4.0mEq/L, Cl=105mEq/L, BUN=14mg/dL, Cre=1.0mg/dL, Ca 8.8mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase=340IU/L, C-reactive protein=1.86mg/dL, KL-6=925U/mL, surfactant protein-D=236ng/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor=5656U/mL. Arterial blood gas analysis (O2 at 3L/min, mask) revealed hypoxemia, hypocarbia, and respiratory alkalosis (pH=7.438, PaO2=71Torr, and PaCO2=33.8Torr). Chest radiographs taken at admission (Day 1) showed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally in the lower lung fields. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demonstrated areas of diffuse GGA bilaterally and several round nodules bilaterally in the lower lobes ( Fig. 1A1 and A2). Echocardiography showed evidence of left heart failure. Blood examination revealed a high atypical lymphocyte count, elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor and lactate dehydrogenase. Although the patient was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin beginning on Day 1, the bilateral pulmonary infiltrates expanded, and the bilateral round pulmonary nodules increased in both size and number within a week (Day 7) (Fig. 1B1 and B2). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the right B4 and transbronchial lung biopsies (TBLB) from the right S8 and S9 were performed via fiber-optic bronchoscopy on Day 9. The recovered fluid was slightly bloody and contained predominantly lymphocytes (56%) (Table 1). Flow cytometric analysis of the BALF revealed proliferation of ATL-phenotypic lymphocytes (CD3+CD4+CD5+CD25+) ( Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical analysis of the TBLB specimens demonstrated infiltration of CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes into the lung ( Fig. 3). Based on these findings, the pulmonary lesions were considered to reflect pulmonary involvement of the ATL, and acute transformation of chronic ATL was diagnosed. Prednisolone (40mg/day) was administered beginning on Day 11, and systemic chemotherapy using THP-COP (50mg/m2 pirarubicin, 750mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 1.4mg/m2 vincristine, and 60mg/m2 prednisolone) was initiated on Day 16. The patient's clinical course is shown in  Fig. 4. The chest radiography findings and oxygenation gradually improved, and oxygen support was discontinued on Day 20 (Fig. 4). Chest radiography and HRCT on Day 37 showed remarkable improvement of the areas of pulmonary GGA and decreased number and size of the pulmonary nodules (Fig. 1C1 and C2). The patient underwent a total of 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy and received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant from his daughter in December 2010. After 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy, chest radiography and HRCT showed no areas of GGA and the number and size of the pulmonary nodules had further decreased (Fig. 1D1 and 2). "

Patients with PTLs were retrieved in the following manner:  • Demographic data (age at diagnosis, gender and symptomatology).   • Histopathological characteristics: For thyroid DCBCL and MALT lymphoma immunohistochemical positivity for CD20, CD45, CD15, and CD30 from fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, core biopsy and surgery and the presence of small lymphoid cells. For T cell lymphoma, appearance of diffusely infiltrating lymphocytes with immunopositivity T-cell markers (CD3 and CD45) and for Hodgkin's lymphomas, presence of Reed Sternberg cells with immunopositivity for CD15 and CD30.   • Clinical stage, according to Musshoff's modification of Ann Arbor staging system [10] by findings from physical examination, hematological tests and electrolytes, computed tomography (CT) scan of neck, chest and bone marrow examination findings.   • Treatment modalities (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and outcomes.   • Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the duration between the completion of treatment and the date of documented disease recurrence, death resulting from the cancer, and/or last follow-up visit (censored). Overall survival (OS) was defined as the duration between the completion of treatment and the date of patient death or last follow-up visit (censored).    "
1155,S0145-2126(11)00332-8,Primary uterine localization of malt lymphoma: A case report and literature review,"Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBC) and follicular lymphomas represent the most common subtypes of primary lymphomas of the uterus. Primary uterine localization of Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma (MZBCL) have been described only anecdotally [2]. MALT lymphoma is a group of indolent NHL defined as extranodal MZBCL of Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) and they most commonly occur in the stomach, lung, salivary glands, and thyroid; nevertheless, virtually all extranodal sites can potentially be involved. Several subtypes of MZBCL has been demonstrated to be associated with specific microbial infections; chronic microbial stimulation may contribute to transformation of lymphocytes triggering a sustained lymphoid proliferation, giving a selective advantage to lymphoid clones that still remain dependent upon antigen stimulation. The microbial pathogen can be considered as a chronic source of antigens increasing the proliferative rate of lymphoid effectors, aiding the transformation process. This model has emerged after the description of several MZBCL developing in the context of chronic antigen-dependent immune stimulation, among which H. pylori-associated gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is the best characterized. Several other correlations between microbial pathogens and MALT lymphomas have been demonstrated. In this contest uterus is not considered a typical site of MALT lymphoma, with only anecdotic mentions in the literature [3]."
1156,S0046-8177(11)00464-3,CD5-positive mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma: a clinicopathologic study of 14 cases," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case selection We searched the database of our hospitals from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2010, for cases of B-cell lymphoma that met the criteria for MALT lymphoma and were positive for CD5 by immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry immunophenotyping. Other types of marginal zone lymphoma were excluded. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records. The study was conducted according to an institutional review board–approved laboratory protocol.   2.2 Morphological examination We reviewed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained slides of all tissue biopsy specimens. In patients with bone marrow involvement, H&E-stained core biopsy and clot sections, as well as Wright-Giemsa–stained bone marrow aspirate smears and touch imprints were reviewed. Differential 500-cell counts were performed on either bone marrow aspirate smears or touch imprints.   2.3 Immunophenotypic analysis Immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry was performed on tissue or bone marrow aspirate specimens from each patient using a FACScan instrument (Becton-Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as described previously [15]. The lymphocyte population was gated using right angle side scatter and CD45 expression. The panel of monoclonal antibodies included reagents specific for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD38, CD43, FMC-7, and immunoglobulin ? and ? light chains (Becton-Dickinson). Immunohistochemical stains were performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of tissue or bone marrow core biopsy or clot using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method and an automated immunostainer (Ventana-Biotech, Tucson, AZ) as described previously [16]. All tissue sections underwent heat-induced antigen retrieval. The antibodies utilized were specific for CD3 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), CD5 (Labvision/Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), CD10 (Novocastra/Vision Biosystem, Benton Lane, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK), CD20 (Dako), CD23 (Novacastra/Vision Biosystem), PAX-5 (Transduction Labs, San Diego, CA), BCL-2 (Novocastra/Vision Biosystem), BCL-6 (Dako), and cyclin D1 (SP4, Labvision/Neomarkers). Membranous reactivity for CD5 in the neoplastic CD20+ B cells was considered positive. CD3+ reactive T cells were used as a control.   2.4 Cytogenetic analysis Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on 7 cases on metaphase cells prepared from bone marrow aspirate specimens (n = 3) or cell suspensions from tissue biopsy specimens (n = 4) using standard techniques. Giemsa-banded metaphases were analyzed, and the results were reported using the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (2005). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for the detection of IGH@ and CCND1 gene rearrangement was performed in 5 cases (cases 1, 4, 10, 12, and 14) on tissue sections using a Vysis LSI MALT1 dual-color, break-apart probe, which hybridizes to band 18q21 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vysis/Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines, IL).

1160,S0967-5868(03)00089-4,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the cauda equina and ocular cranial nerves: case reports and literature review," Clinical cases  Case 1 A 71-year-old woman, previously independent, presented with a 3 week history of worsening pain and weakness of both lower limbs, which left her wheelchair bound. She denied any back pain, other sensory or sphincter disturbances, weight loss, fever or night sweats. Examination revealed flaccid paraparesis with absent lower limb reflexes and an inconsistent sensory loss in the left L4-5 dermatomes. This progressed over 10 days to complete flaccid paraplegia, with a sensory level to all modalities below the L2 level bilaterally. Anal tone and peri-anal sensation were preserved. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Routine haematology and biochemistry were within normal limits, and her HIV serology was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine reported thickening of the nerve roots below the conus contrast enhancement of the cauda equina following gadolinium was noted. A bone scan revealed multiple bony lesions including lesions in the seventh and eighth thoracic vertebrae and skull. One of the skull lesions was biopsied, but was negative for malignancy. Three weeks following admission, whilst receiving oral dexamethasone, she developed a complete right third nerve palsy over 24 hours. An MRI scan of the brain with gadolinium revealed an old parietal infarct and cerebral atrophy, but no abnormality of the third nerve. Lumbar puncture was difficult to perform, and yielded a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing abnormal lymphoid cells. A definitive diagnosis of a diffuse large B cell NHL was made on tissue obtained at laminectomy of the eighth thoracic vertebra. Further staging included a normal thoraco–abdomino–pelvic computerised tomography (CT) scan; gallium scanning which showed increased uptake in the lower thoracic vertebrae, the right para-aortic lymph nodes and the right tibia; and a bone marrow examination which revealed no evidence of involvement. Her disease was classed as stage IV due to her CNS and bony involvement. Her initial treatment consisted of high-dose oral dexamethasone, which was gradually weaned. Following the definitive diagnosis of lymphoma, she was commenced on intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) via an Omaya reservoir and CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisolone). She received 4mg of MTX 3 times per week with folinic acid rescue and CHOP at a reduced dose due to her poor performance status. Within a week of intrathecal MTX, her CSF protein normalised and she obtained significant improvement of third cranial nerve function, which continued to improve over the next month. At follow-up 15 months after presentation (9 months after cessation of MTX), she was still wheel chair bound, but with normal third cranial nerve function. However, her condition then deteriorated. The decision to palliate was made and she died a month later of overwhelming sepsis.   Case 2 A 69-year-old male, previously able to walk unaided, presented with a 2 week history of severe lumbosacral back pain, accompanied by a 5 day history of worsening bilateral leg weakness, worse on the right side. By the time of presentation, he was no longer able to walk. He had normal bladder function, but a 5 day history of constipation, which resolved with aperients. He denied any other sensory symptoms, fever, night sweats or lymphadenopathy. He had a relevant past history of a stage IV large cell gastric lymphoma diagnosed 6 months previously and was receiving 3 weekly CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone), the last cycle given 2 weeks before the onset of his symptoms. Examination of the lower limbs revealed marked wasting, flaccidity and a symmetrical, global pattern of weakness. Reflexes were absent, save for the left plantar response, which was flexor. Sensory examination showed only patchy loss to pain and temperature. Rectal examination revealed normal tone and sensation, and upper limb and cranial nerve examination was normal. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Routine haematology and biochemistry revealed no significant abnormality. A CT scan of the lumbar spine performed prior to his admission revealed a broad posterior bulge of the L4-5 disc indenting the thecal sac and causing some compression of the L5 nerve roots. The patient was thus commenced on dexamethasone 4mg orally qid. On arrival at our institution, an MRI scan without gadolinium was reported as normal. Repeated attempts at lumbar puncture, including under CT guidance at multiple levels, failed to obtain any CSF. Neurophysiological studies revealed changes consistent with a lower motor neuron deficit. Protein immuno- and electrophoresis did not show a paraprotein. A provisional diagnosis of Guillian–Barré syndrome was made and plasmapheresis was initiated. This was complicated by recurrent hypotension and was abandoned in favour of 3 courses of intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient's lower limb weakness progressed to the point of paraplegia. A variable sensory level to small fibre modalities below the knees and to large fibre modalities to the T12 level could be elicited. Following the second immunoglobulin treatment, he developed a complete palsy of his right abducens nerve. At the time of the onset of the abducens nerve palsy, the initial MRI was reviewed and increased signal was noted on T2-weighted images from the conus to the S1 segment of the spinal cord. The MRI examination was repeated, this time with intravenous gadolinium, and revealed abnormal signal in all vertebral bodies from C1 to S1 and an extensively enhancing soft tissue mass wholly occupying the thecal sac in the lumbar region. Pre- and post-contrast parasagittal cuts of the spinal cord are shown in Fig. 1 . A presumptive diagnosis of recurrent lymphoma was made, and the patient was treated with radiotherapy to the lumbar spine, with no improvement in his flaccid paralysis or his cranial nerve palsy. His course was further complicated by dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia and he died a short time later.  "

A case report," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Patient selection Of the 54 cases with MYC translocations previously reported by Johnson et al. [3], a case with an uncharacterized MYC translocation at chromosomal band 12p12 was selected for further study. The histological diagnosis was assigned according to the 2008 WHO guidelines by an expert hematopathologist (RG) [4]. The case was confirmed to have an 8q24/MYC rearrangement by karyotype analysis plus interphase and metaphase FISH analysis using the commercial dual color MYC break apart probe. The study was approved by the University of British Columbia-British Columbia Cancer Agency Research Ethics Board (REB no. H08-02834) and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.   2.2 Conventional cytogenetics and FISH analysis Standard karyotype analysis by G-banding was performed as previously described [5]. Karyotype descriptions were recorded as per the ISCN (2009) for normal metaphases, stemlines and sidelines [6]. FISH analysis was performed at diagnosis on methanol–acetic acid-fixed cell pellet using a commercial dual color MYC break apart probe and a dual color dual fusion probe for the IGH/BCL2 translocation (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL). Based on the FISH patterns obtained with the MYC commercial probe, additional “in house” probes for MYC were designed and used to further characterize and map the MYC breakpoints (see below). A total of 200 interphase nuclei and 5–10 metaphases were scored for both MYC and IGH/BCL2 translocations. A cut-off value of >5% of interphase cells with identified IGH/BCL2 fusions and MYC break apart was considered as positive.   2.3 Chromosome walking/FISH analysis Precise mapping of chromosomal breakpoints and the identification of the candidate gene at the breakpoint on the partner chromosome 12p12 were performed by chromosome walking/FISH-based analysis using minimally overlapping fosmid clones kindly provided by Dr Wan Lam (http://www.bccrc.ca/cg/lam_main.html). The corresponding gene(s) that mapped within the breakpoint spanning probe pair was then identified using the UCSC browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/ (March 2006, hg 18). To confirm the possible candidate gene as a MYC translocation partner, these fosmid probes were used to demonstrate a dual fusion signal pattern, using custom-made flanking probes for the candidate gene and for MYC, applied to both interphase cells and metaphases. The fosmid probes, including the “in house” probes for MYC, were labeled using the direct labeling method by nick translation using a commercial labeling kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL). The fosmid probes were initially tested on normal peripheral blood lymphocytes to check the efficiency of labeling, chromosomal specificity and false positivity before application to clinical samples. For fosmid FISH experiments, a total of 200 interphase nuclei were scored and at least 10 metaphases when available. The cut-off for a positive result for split-signal analysis was established to be 10% of interphase cells and >1 metaphase, if available, and for dual fusion analysis, a positive result was established at 5% of interphase cells and >1 metaphase, if available.

These patients may be instructive in better understanding this rare variant of CTCL, because chronically sun-damaged skin is known to express defects involving epidermal dendritic cells, which are speculated to play a role in epitheliotropic T-cell responses."
1180,S0090-8258(03)00057-X,Primary non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the uterine cervix successfully treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy: case report," Case report A 56 year old gravida I, para 1 woman with postmenopausal vaginal bloody discharge and pelvic mass discovered on bimanual examination was referred to the I. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Semmelweis University. A bulky, exophytic cervical mass 8 cm in diameter was palpable along with a normal size uterine corpus. The tumor invaded the left parametrium to the pelvic sidewall and the anterior and left side of the vaginal wall. Ultrasonography confirmed a cervical mass measuring 74 × 56 mm in diameter, and moderate hydroureteronephrosis. No other alteration was detected by the clinical staging, which established a FIGO stage IIIb tumor of the uterine cervix. Punch biopsy from the cervical mass was performed and preliminary histopathologic examinations confirmed a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the uterine cervix. Further immunohistochemical studies were conducted to specify the immune phenotype and genotype of the tumor. Tumor cells showed intensive CD-20 positivity, but CD-23, CD-10, CD-3, and CD-5 immunostainings were negative (Fig. 1).  Fifty percent of the tumor cells showed intensive positivity to Ki-67 nuclear proliferative antigene (Fig 2).  After the isolation of tumor cell DNA, we made an attempt using PCR to determine the gene translocation on the hard chain of the immunoglobulin; although, no positivity could be demonstrated, because of the paraffin embedding of the tissue block. Pathologic examination revealed the final diagnosis of a primary, diffuse, large B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the uterine cervix according to the WHO Classification [9]. Operative eradication of the tumor was planned after obtaining patient consent. A complete clinical staging workup including CT scan of the abdomen and thorax, abdominal ultrasonography, bone scintigraphy, bone marrow biopsy, and blood tests was carried out. Tests excluded tumor progression to other organs and indicated a primary cervical lymphoma, stage IE according to Ann Arbor classification. Six courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy according to the CHOP protocol (Day 1, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 iv, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 iv, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 iv. Days 1–5; prednisone 100 mg/m2 po) were administered on a monthly basis. No major side effects developed during the treatment. Clinical examinations following chemotherapy revealed a complete resolution in tumor size. As planned, a Piver 3 radical hysterectomy according to Wertheim was performed with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and regional lymph node dissection [10]. There were no intraoperative or early postoperative complications. Histopathology was unable to confirm any residual tumor in the surgical specimen; therefore, we considered the pathologic response to the chemotherapy complete. The patient is alive with no evidence of recurrent disease 5 years following the initial diagnosis. "
1185,S0145-2126(11)00319-5,Primary cutaneous CD30 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma – Report of a case treated with bexarotene,"CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma is characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation of phenotypically abnormal T lymphocytes, with CD30 expression in more than 75% of tumor cells [1]. It usually occurs on the 6th decade and shows a male preponderance [1]. It usually presents as an asymptomatic isolated nodule or tumor that can eventually ulcerate [2]. Most often it is localized on the limbs, although it can also frequently appear on the face. In 90% of the cases the lesions are solitary [2]. Extracutaneous involvement is not a common feature, occurring in approximately 10% of the patients [1]. This determines its good prognosis, with a five-year survival ranging from 77% to 95% [3]. Partial or complete spontaneous regression occurs in approximately 25% of patients with primary cutaneous disease [2]."
1187,S2152-2650(12)00294-7,CD30-Positive Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma and Response to Brentuximab Vedotin: 2 Illustrative Cases," Introduction  Case 1 The patient is a 75-year-old, otherwise healthy male who had a history of developing a bilateral axillary ‘burning,' with a painful, pruritic erythematous rash in bilateral axillae, right worse than left. The rash persisted for 2 months despite topical steroid treatment. Physical exam revealed an 8 × 4 cm pink tumor with erosion in the right axilla. Biopsy of the right axillary tumor revealed mycosis fungoides (MF) with large cell transformation (Figure 1A). There was a confluent dermal mass of enlarged and atypical lymphocytes, with exocytosis of lymphocytes into the overlying atrophic epidermis. The large lymphocytes contained vesicular chromatin and variably prominent nucleoli, representing 75% of the infiltrating lymphocyte population. Also present was a minor population of intermixed small lymphocytes with complexly folded nuclei and condensed nuclear chromatin. The large atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3, CD4, and CD30, and negative for CD8, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), consistent with large cell transformed MF. A biopsy of the right inguinal skin lesion also revealed smaller lymphocytes that were positive for CD4 and CD8. Identical clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) ? and ? rearrangements were noted in the right axillary tumor and the right inguinal lesion, evidence that both lesions arose from the same clone. Staging positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) was notable only for activity in the right axillary region. Lab work including a complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, and peripheral blood flow cytometry were unremarkable. A bone marrow biopsy was not performed. He was diagnosed with stage IIB (T3N0M0B0) tumor stage MF with large cell transformation, with < 10% skin involvement. He was treated with single agent gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle but had rapid progression of disease after 1 cycle. He was then treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) complicated by grade 1 neuropathy. After an initial partial response, his disease progressed in the right axilla, scalp, left nare (Figure 1B), and right inguinal regions. A biopsy of the scalp tumors revealed transformed mycosis fungoides with similar morphology to the previous biopsies. At this point he was treated with the novel antibody drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks. After just 1 cycle he had a partial response to therapy with complete flattening of his scalp lesions, central necrosis of his left paranasal lesion, and complete flattening of his right axillary region lesion. After 2 cycles he had achieved a complete response, with resolution of the tumor in his right axilla and the tumors at the left nare, scalp, right flank, and right inguinal areas (Figure 1C). Because of persisting neuropathy from CHOP, and side effects of taste aversion attributed to brentuximab vedotin, the dose was reduced to 1.2 mg/kg for the subsequent cycles, with significant improvement dysgeusia, and no progression of neuropathy. He has now completed 10 cycles of therapy and continues to maintain a complete response.   Case 2 The patient is an 87-year-old man who has a history of a pruritic rash over his chest and trunk. His rash failed to respond to topical steroids for presumed eczema. Approximately 1 year later he experienced progression of his symptoms with eruption of large, pruritic, deep red, oval scaly plaques scattered on his trunk, arms, buttocks, thighs, and legs. In addition he developed weeping, tumorous lesions on his right thigh, left upper medial arm, left anterior thigh, and his anterior right shin. A biopsy of a plaque on his chest wall revealed a superficial band-like/lichenoid infiltrate with deep dermal perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate containing small to intermediate sized lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours consistent with mycosis fungoides. In addition, a biopsy of a tumor on his right thigh revealed a neoplastic infiltrate with epidermotropism which was positive for CD2, CD43, CD25, CD30, and focally positive for TCR-?F1. The tumorous cells did not express CD3, CD5, CD7, or ALK. The morphology was suggestive of mycoses fungoides, however, the immunophenotypic profile suggested cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), small cell variant. Staging CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable, and flow cytometry of peripheral blood detected an aberrant clone (<1000/?L). He was diagnosed as stage IIA (T2N0M0B1), with approximately 15% total skin involvement. Considering his age and comorbidities, he was treated with 10 cycles of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (Doxil; Janssen) with a very good partial response, however this was stopped 7 months later because of a drug shortage. He then received 2 months of narrow band ultraviolet light B treatment with minimal response. He then presented with progression of his disease with tumors on the right chest wall and scalp (Figure 1E). Biopsy of the tumor revealed similar morphology and immunohistochemistry to his original skin lesions and CD30 was diffusely positive (see Figure 1D). He was treated with brentuximab vedotin 1.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, with dose reduction because of age and renal insufficiency. After just 1 treatment he had near-complete resolution of his tumors (see Figure 1F). After a second cycle he had achieved a complete response. He has now completed 8 cycles of therapy and maintains a complete response without significant toxicity.  "
1188,S1871-4048(10)00064-X,Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the subglottis in children—Report of a single case with positive anaplastic lymphoma kinase," 2 Case report A seven-year-old boy was referred by the Otolaryngology Service of the Infanta Margarita Hospital of Cabra after presenting with a dysphonia of five months duration. His personal antecedents included neither known allergies nor associated pathologies. Physical exploration returned completely negative results, and there was no evidence of respiratory problems. Flexible laryngoscopy was performed under local anesthesia, using a Machida® ENT-30PIII flexible laryngoscope (LTD 13-8 Honkomagome 6-Chome, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-0021, Japan), which revealed a violet-red lesion of the right subglottis (Fig. 1 ). Cervical computerized tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast medium produced a well-defined rounded image, which absorbed the contrast medium homogeneously, at the level of the anterior right vocal cord (Fig. 2 ). Endoscopic surgery was employed to excise the lesion. Pathological examination revealed the existence of two tissue fragments lined with squamous and pseudostratified ciliated Schneiderian epithelium on the right vocal cord (Fig. 3 ). At subepithelial level, the fragments displayed a proliferation of fibroblasts mixed with inflammatory lymphoplasmocyte cell structures and thick-walled blood vessels of plexiform appearance, all within a myxohyaline stroma. Between the fibroblasts, dispersed cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm were prominent and centered on a large nucleus and prominent nucleole. Immunohistochemical techniques were employed to stain for vimentin, smooth-muscle actin and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 1 (ALK-1), in order to confirm the lineage of myofibroblasts (Fig. 4 ). The mitotic index was low, and there was no mucosal ulceration. The patient was followed up at six-monthly intervals; at 12 months he displayed no signs of recidivism and is currently asymptomatic.

The only relevant information in the patient's past history was that he had taken allopurinol for 3 months to treat asymptomatic hyperuricemia. He had interrupted this medication 3 days before visiting our department. Physical examination revealed an oval, dome-shaped erythematous tumor measuring 3 x 4cm on the left cheek. The tumor had well-defined borders and a shiny surface and was indurated on palpation (Fig. 1A)."
1196,S0344-0338(12)00069-6,Rare case of a large mediastinal cyst involved in Hodgkin's lymphoma," Case report The patient presented with generalized pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath in June 2008. The symptoms appeared for the first time. Cough, asthma, loss of weight, or fever was negated. He had been a smoker for two years. His medical history revealed no remarkable incidents. Pulmonary function, ecg, bronchoscopy, and coronary angiography affirmed findings appropriate to the patient's age. Differential blood count and tumor markers were normal. As the first diagnostic step, a two layer chest X-ray showed a right paracardiac mass in addition to a complete shadow of the retrosternal space (Fig. 1a). Thus, the patient was submitted to the ward, and further diagnostics were initiated. Initially, a magnetic resonance imaging of the chest was performed. The T1- and T2-weighted images showed a cystic space-occupying process with 17.6×7.1×6.8cm in expansion and inhomogenous signals. Wall structures and septa within the lesion showed intensive contrast enhancement in the T1-weighted images. This lesion filled the retrosternal space entirely and extended to the right paramediastinum. In order to exclude an infiltration of the pericardium, a cardial MRI was performed as well. These images demonstrated that the pericardium was demarcated from the space-occupying lesion (Fig. 1b). All given radiological findings indicated a monstrous cystic retrosternal process, most likely a thymic cyst. Untypical for this diagnosis was the contrast-enhancing septation of the lesion. Malignant transformation could therefore not be excluded. The case was discussed in the hospital's interdisciplinary cancer center, and a primary resection of the tumor was recommended. The operation was performed using sternotomy. The encapsulated tumor was located in the center of the mediastinum. It did not infiltrate other organs and could be completely removed without complications. The thymus was mostly destructed by the cyst, only a small part was preserved and replaced by it. The patient recovered quickly from the surgical intervention and could be discharged ten days after operation. The specimen was examined intraoperatively. We saw a tumor weighing 1330g. It showed one cyst up to 14cm in diameter. The inner surface of the cyst was grayish-white with knotty structures. Enlarged lymph-nodes were attached to the outer surface (Fig. 2a). The intraoperative frozen section allowed strong suspicion of Morbus Hodgkin in the cystic wall (Fig. 2b). After embedding in paraffin, further histological diagnostics of the cystic wall showed that it was outlined by squamous and cuboidal epithelium, positive for antibodies against cytokeratin. Furthermore, the cystic wall consisted of additional small satellite cysts which were seen microscopically. No features of a bronchogenic, pericardial or parathyroid cyst, such as specialized respiratory epithelium, cartilage, mesothelial lining, or parathyroidal endocrine cells, were noted. Therefore, and because of its location, the origin of the cyst was most likely the thymus (secondary thymic cyst). The cystic wall and adjacent lymph nodes were infiltrated by classical Hodgkin's lymphoma of the nodular sclerosing type (Fig. 2c). Reed-Sternberg cells (Fig. 2d) and Hodgkin cells, positive for CD30, were found in a polymorphous inflammatory background (Fig. 2e). However, the separately resected left lower horn of the thymus, which survived the destruction and was replaced by the cyst, was not involved by the lymphoma. Subsequent to the resection, the appropriate diagnostic procedures in disease staging were completed and no further tumor manifestation could be detected. Adjuvant cytostatic therapy has been conducted over 3 months. Up to now, the patient has been in full remission for three years. "
1197,S0090-3019(02)00845-5,Primary B-cell lymphoma of the clivus Case report," Case report A 60-year-old woman with persistent headaches for 2 months presented to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset of double vision while driving. The visual defect initially occurred only on left lateral gaze, but rapidly progressed to a constant state. Covering one eye relieved the patient’s visual symptoms. The headaches had been treated with antibiotics because a computed tomography (CT) scan showed possible sphenoid sinusitis. Medical history included a functional endoscopic sinus surgery 6 years previously for chronic sinusitis and polyps. On physical examination, the left eye showed a left lateral gaze paralysis consistent with cranial nerve VI palsy, with no other remarkable findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1)  revealed an expansile, infiltrative process in the clivus. The lesion caused expansion of the posterior clivus which resulted in mild extrinsic compression of the prepontine cistern. Lateral expansion of the mass resulted in partial encasement of the internal carotid arteries (Figure 2).  After contrast administration, there was intense, irregular clival enhancement with a central component of slightly decreased enhancement. There was no mass effect on the pituitary gland. A follow-up CT study of the paranasal sinuses showed clival destruction and detected no nasopharyngeal mass. Mammography and chest radiography were both unremarkable. Tissue biopsy and partial resection were performed via an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach. A standard sublabial incision was made for the transseptal approach to the sphenoid. The sphenoid sinus was entered endoscopically and a wide osteotomy performed. Using an image guided system, the cortex overlying the clival mass was outlined and carefully delineated from surrounding structures. The posterior wall of the sphenoid was then penetrated and a large soft tissue mass was encountered. Using a ringed curette and a 30-degree pediatric nasal endoscope, the tumor mass was debrided and large amounts of tissue were sent to pathology for permanent section and flow cytometry. The posterior or lateral bony cortex of the clivus was not transgressed surgically and had not been invaded by tumor extension. Finally, the bone fragments taken from the face of the sphenoid were finely minced and packed into the clival defect. The mucoperichondrial flaps were re-approximated loosely and the wounds closed uneventfully. Examination during biopsy showed no evidence of intracranial extension. Pathology revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Histologically, the specimen showed sheets of neoplastic cells with round to ovoid nuclei and dense chromatin infiltrating around bony trabeculae. The tumor appeared admixed with histiocytes and other inflammatory cells and most areas showed degenerative changes and necrosis. Immunohistochemical studies showed reactivity of the diffuse infiltrating cells for CD20 and CD79A. The proliferating marker, MIB-1 showed focal areas of proliferative activity at approximately 50% (Figure 3).   The patient tolerated the biopsy well and was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day. Further radiologic scans were conducted 4 weeks after the biopsy. CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis were unremarkable. The F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed a bi-lobed focus of significant increase of FDG accumulation that corresponded to the malignancy in the clivus, without any additional sites of FDG accumulation in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. After the fourth course of chemotherapy, reevaluation of the MRI and the PET scans remained unchanged and cerebral spinal fluid cytology showed no malignancy. The patient’s ability to abduct the left eye beyond the midline has improved. The left pupil remains smaller compared to the right pupil. "
1207,S1054-8807(02)00112-6,Human herpesvirus-8-positive body cavity-based lymphoma involving the atria of the heart A case report," 2 Case report The patient is a 31-year-old Ethiopian man who was known to be HIV-seropositive since 1997. He was diagnosed with KS of the lung in June 1997 and treated with three cycles of Taxol. He was also placed on antiretroviral therapy at that time. In March 1998, the patient developed exertional shortness of breath and cough. No other symptoms, except for occasional episodes of dysphagia, were reported. Chest X-ray revealed a large pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram showed normal rhythm and nonspecific T-wave changes. Pericardiocentesis was performed and 1.3 l of fluid was removed. Cytopathologic examination of the fluid revealed more than 95% of nucleated cells to be atypical lymphoid cells, consistent with high-grade large cell lymphoma with anaplastic and immunoblastic features typical of PEL. Molecular DNA analysis of the fluid revealed DNA sequences of HHV-8 and clonal rearrangement of the JH region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Echocardiogram revealed a filling defect in the posterior aspect of the left atrium with thickening of the atrial wall. Whole-body computerized tomographic scanning confirmed no evidence of other masses or lymph node enlargement. The patient was treated with multiple cycles of combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP). Follow-up studies revealed resolution of the left atrial thickening. In August 2000, the patient presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath on exertion associated with lightheadedness. He reported having night sweats, persistent fevers and abdominal discomfort during the previous several months. Laboratory evaluation on admission disclosed mild anemia and CD4-positive lymphocyte count of 97 per microliter. There was no evidence of peripheral blood involvement by lymphoma cells. Contrast-enhanced axial T-1 MR examination of the heart (Fig. 1)  revealed a large enhancing left atrial mass obstructing the mitral valve and large right atrial mass involving the pulmonary valves. The patient underwent exploratory open-heart surgery. The right atrial wall was 1.5 cm thick and filled with tumor. In the right atrial cavity, there was a 3×4 cm mass protruding from the right atrial wall. It was partially obstructing the inferior vena cava. The mass extended to the atrial septal wall as well as to the left atrial wall. Intraoperative diagnosis of the atrial tumor was NHL. Given the past chemotherapeutic response of the lymphoma, removal of the tumor was not deemed feasible and an incisional biopsy was performed for diagnostic confirmation and special stains. Following diagnosis of atrial involvement by PEL, the patient was started on a chemotherapeutic regimen with etoposide, methyl-prednisolone, cytoarabine and cysplatinum (ESHAP). Follow-up CT scan performed 3 months later revealed a persistent intracardiac mass and normal pericardium. "

1222,S1067-2516(10)00326-1,Soft Tissue Anaplastic Large T-Cell Lymphoma Associated with a Metallic Orthopedic Implant: Case Report and Review of the Current Literature," Case Report A 77-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of pain and erythema at the medial aspect of the distal portion of his right leg, adjacent to an old wound where 7 years earlier he had undergone placement of a stainless steel plate and screws for repair of a spiral fracture of the tibia. He had suffered no recent trauma to this area, and denied any systemic signs or symptoms that could have been related to infection. Other than localized swelling, erythema, and minimal warmth at the old surgical location, his physical examination was unrevealing. Plain radiographs of the distal tibia showed well-healed bone that was void of any lucency, erosion, or any other abnormality surrounding the osseous tissue and the metallic plate (Fig. 1 ). No additional imaging studies were undertaken, and laboratory data were unremarkable. Despite a normal white blood cell count, a diagnosis of infection was assumed, and the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room where removal of the intact plate and screws was carried out. During the dissection, which was performed through the well-healed postsurgical scar, the surgeon encountered an amorphous gelatinous material deep in the soft tissues and adherent to the extracted metallic plate. Samples of this material were submitted for microbiologic studies and pathologic inspection. The Gram stain analysis revealed a paucity of white blood cells and no organisms. Empiric antimicrobial therapy was initiated pending culture results that ultimately proved negative for aerobic, anaerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal pathogens. Unexpectedly, the histopathologic analysis of the tissue samples demonstrated the presence of sheets of undifferentiated malignant cells (Fig. 2 ). Although the morphologic features of these cells suggested a lymphoid malignancy, only after the use of specialized immunohistochemical studies, which showed the cells to be positive for the pan-T-cell marker CD2 and to coexpress the T-cell helper subset marker CD4, as well as CD30 and perforin, and flow cytometry and molecular analysis indicated anaplastic T-cell lymphoma. Ultimately, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies confirmed the T-cell lineage of this lymphoproliferative malignancy. Subsequent computerized tomography (CT) along with positron emission tomography (PET) scans failed to exhibit disease distant from the involved lower extremity. Thereafter, the diagnosis was discussed with the patient who underwent oncologic evaluation and decided to pursue systemic chemotherapy that consisted of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) in a medical center distant from ours and therefore was lost to follow-up. Based on the diagnosis and clinical staging of the tumor, the prognosis for 5-year survival for this patient was unknown. "
1223,S0150-9861(16)30115-8,Primary central nervous system natural killer/T-cell lymphoma: An atypical case of chronic meningitis," Discussion Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) represents 2% of primary CNS tumors and 0.8% of lymphomas. Leptomeningeal localization is a frequent form of presentation for secondary CNS lymphomas, but it accounts for only 7% of all PCNSL [1]. NK/T-cell lymphoma is a rare and heterogeneous group of hematologic neoplasms with a wide variety of clinical, morphological and immune characteristics that may compromise the CNS [2]. These lymphomas are mainly extranodal and typically present as nasal and paranasal destructive lesions. The 2016 WHO classification divides them into several sub-groups most of them with surface positive CD3, CD16, CD56, CD57 and negative myeloperoxidase [2]. Exclusive CNS localization is rare, with only 9 cases reported in the literature [3]. Five of these patients were men (55%). Mean age at presentation was 43 years (25–68 years) with a mean survival time of 4 months (1–18 months). Seven cases involved brain parenchyma (71%), 1 had exclusive meningeal involvement and 1 had mixed pattern. Only 1 patient was immunocompromised. EBv was found in 7 patients (71%). Our patient is the oldest yet reported and the second with an exclusive meningeal pattern to our knowledge. The exclusive leptomeningeal involvement was reported in a woman, manifested with multiple cranial neuropathy, with positive EBv and disseminated leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI [3–5]. Infectious diseases of the CNS, mainly tuberculosis and mycosis, should be quickly ruled out due to the severe inflammatory characteristics of the CSF [5]. Other differential diagnosis that ought to be considered include neuro-inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada) and neoplasms (glioma, meningeal carcinomatosis and melanoma). Exclusive leptomeningeal involvement by primary CNS NK/T-cell lymphoma is an extremely rare form of presentation.

Amoxycillin was ineffective. On admission, fever was 39°C, pulse 106 bpm, and blood pressure 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination was unremarkable; spleen, liver, and lymph nodes were not enlarged. Laboratory results yielded: hemoglobin 9.1 g dl?1, hematocrit 26%, white blood cell (WBC) count 3.1×109/l, platelets 128×109/l, ESR 88 mm/h, and LDH 377 IU (N<370 IU). Routine tests including blood coagulation, kidney and liver functions were normal. Repeated blood and urinary cultures were sterile. Tests for Chlamydia, Toxoplasma, Salmonella, Rickettsia, Legionella, Brucella, Mycoplasma, malaria, tuberculosis, and viruses including CMV, EBV, HIV, and parvovirus were negative. Protein- and immunoelectrophoresis, C3, C4 complement, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were normal or negative. On chest X-ray, small pleural effusions in both costodiaphragmatic spaces were detected with characteristics of transudate. Abdominal and lung CT, echocardiography, thyroid and bone scans did not reveal additional findings. Temporal artery biopsy was normal. BM aspiration revealed increased cellularity, predominantly of the white cell line. Moreover, a few monocytes with prominent nucleoli and increased numbers of lymphocytes were detected. High fever and weakness continued. Examination remained unremarkable. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were ineffective. Hemoglobin dropped to 7.2 g dl?1, WBC decreased to 2.8×109/l, and platelets to 65×109/l. BM biopsy showed cellularity of up to 100%, a mild to moderate increase in background reticulin fibers, and a large population of small lymphoid cells with small, irregular nuclei. Immunohistochemical studies included CD45RB, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD23, CD43, CD74, CDW75, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, TRAcP, DBA-44, and light chain-kappa, lambda, and myeloperoxidase. Most lymphoid cells were immunoreactive to CD-45RB, CD-20, CD-74, CDw-75, and Bcl-2, with a minor component positive to CD-10, CD-3, CD-5, and CD-43. The morphological features, together with the immunohistochemical results, were consistent with a mature B small cell lymphoproliferative disorder, possibly of follicular origin, but they could not be further classified according to the REAL or WHO classification. Prednisone 80 mg/day was initiated. Several days later the patient felt better. Fever subsided and she was discharged after 35 days. Pancytopenia was essentially unaltered. Attempts at reducing prednisone dosage were followed by fever resurgence. The patient eventually succumbed to CMV infection 18 weeks following symptom onset. Hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy were absent throughout the course.   2.2 Patient 2 A 78-year-old male was admitted for anemia, weight loss of 6 kg, and progressive weakness of 3 months duration. Past history included essential hypertension. Physical examination was normal, blood pressure 145/90 mmHg, pulse rate 78 bpm. Notably, no lymph node enlargement or hepatosplenomegaly was detected. Laboratory examinations revealed: hemoglobin 10.3 g dl?1, hematocrit 31%, mean corpuscular volume 101 ?l, WBC 5.4×109/l (neutrophils 48%, lymphocytes 44%, monocytes 8%), platelets 64.2×109 /l, ESR 45 mm/h, and LDH 1720 IU. Additional routine laboratory data including serum iron, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folic acid were normal. Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography and CT were normal. BM aspiration revealed an increased number of lymphocytes. On BM biopsy, a 100% cellularity and an exaggerated background fibrosis were seen. The hematopoietic elements were replaced by a diffuse population of small, irregular lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical studies included the following antibodies: CD-45RB, CD-3, CD-20, CD-10, CD-23, CD-5, CD-43, CD-74, CDw-75, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6, as well as kappa and lambda light chains. The lymphoid cells showed a strong and diffuse immunoreactivity to CD-45RB, CD-20, CD-74, CDw-75, Bcl-2, and Kappa monoclonality. These results favor the diagnosis of a mature B small cell lymphoproliferative disorder, not further classifiable. Prednisone 60 mg/day was initiated but discontinued by the patient after 2 months. Two years later, he was admitted for aggravation of anemia. Lymph nodes, spleen, and liver were not enlarged. Hemoglobin was 4.0 g dl?1, hematocrit 13%, platelets 30×109/l, ESR 130 mm/h, and iron and ferritin values were normal. The patient was discharged after blood transfusions and died 4.5 years after diagnosis from septic shock.  "
1230,S2468-1245(17)30110-9,T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma presenting as chylothorax in a child,"A 13 years-male-child presented with cough, shortness of breath and weight loss. Shortness of breath was aggravated on lying down and associated with stridor. There was history of weight loss (4 kg in 15 days), with no history of night sweats, hemoptysis, bony pains, jaundice or fever. On examination, the patient had 2 × 2cm, firm, painless, mobile right cervical lymph node. Dullness was noted in the parasternal region and left infrascapular and inframammary region with decrease in breath sounds. Chest radiograph showed left sided pleural effusion with prominence of superior mediastinum, pleural tap revealed chylothorax (Fig. 1 a), which on examination showed elevated triglycerides with low cholesterol (triglycerides 2184 mg/dl, cholesterol 96 mg/dl) and mature looking lymphocytes. Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid fast bacilli was negative. Contrast enhanced CT (CECT) chest showed a conglomerate mass in anterior mediastinum. FNAC of cervical lymph node showed atypical lymphoid cells, 1.5 to 2.5 times the size of mature lymphocyte, with opened up chromatin and some of them showing cleaving. On immunocytochemistry, these cells were positive for tdt and CD3 and negative for CD20, based on which the case was reported T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (Fig. 1b and c). Staging bone marrow showed no infiltration and CSF did not show any malignant cells. Echocardiography was normal. Prephase was started with injection dexamethasone and changed to prednisolone. Modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster regimen (BMF 2000) was given. The child improved symptomatically after one month and follow up chest radiograph was normal (Fig. 1d)."
1238,S1521-6926(16)30125-6,"Ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma: Clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment"," Clinical presentation In the Western countries, OAML usually affects elderly patients (median age, 65 years), with a higher prevalence among females. The interval between developing of symptoms and diagnosis is variable, with a median of 6–7 months (range 1–135 months). The clinical presentation of OAML depends on involved structures with 25% showing conjunctival lesions, intraorbital masses in 75% of cases, and bilateral (mostly conjunctival) involvement reported in 10%–15% of cases [14]. Conjunctival OAML usually appears as the typical “salmon red patch” (Fig. 1 ), while intraorbital lymphoma may cause exophthalmos (27% of cases), palpable masses (19%), ptosis (6%), diplopia (2%), orbital edema or nodules, epiphora, and potentially impaired ocular motility [14]. At physical examination, MALT lymphoma may be undistinguishable from other orbital diseases, since different lymphomas affect the ocular adnexa; histologic diagnosis is mandatory for correct treatment.

1248,S0145-2126(01)00183-7,Evidence for T-large granular lymphocyte-mediated neutropenia in Rituximab-treated lymphoma patients: report of two cases," 2 Case reports  2.1 Case 1 In April 2000, a 41-year-old man was referred to our department for management of refractory mantle cell lymphoma. BM biopsy examination showed a 55% infiltration by malignant CD5+, CD20+, CD23?, cyclin D1+ B cells. Initially (April–May 2000), he was given two courses of the ESHAP chemotherapy regimen (to which he responded partially) and eventually attained complete remission (CR) (assessed immunohistochemically and by PCR analysis for clonal Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements) with two further, combined Rituximab-ESHAP courses (June–July 2000). On recovery from the second Rituximab-ESHAP course, PB stem cells (PBSC) were collected. Post-CR, he was given four weekly courses of Rituximab (August 2000). Then, in late September 2000, the patient received high dose chemotherapy (BEAM) with autologous PBSC support (4.6×106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight); while on recovery (late October 2000, with a steadily rising hemoglobin level and platelet count), neutropenia was noted (WBC 8.2×109/l, neutrophils 12%; lymphocytes 67% of which 40% had typical LGL morphology; hemoglobin: 9.8g/dl, platelets: 64.0×109/l). Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen as well as human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. PB and BM immunophenotypic analysis showed absence of B cells and a predominance of CD3+ CD8+ CD57+ CD28? over CD4+ T cells. BM biopsy findings on H- and E-stained sections were suggestive of involvement by lymphoma: a moderate (?15–20%) lymphocytic infiltration was identified both diffusely as well as in the form of three aggregates (one paratrabecular, the other two intramedullary). Lymphocytes were small or medium-sized with rounded or irregular nuclei and prominent clear cytoplasm. On immunohistochemistry, the lymphoid aggregates lacked CD20+, CD79a+, CD45RA(4KB-5)+ B cells and were composed entirely of CD3+, CD45RO+, CD43+ T cells, with a slight predominance of CD8+ over CD4+ T cells. A moderate number of CD3+ lymphocytes were also CD57+. The myeloid series was slightly reduced with a left shift. The evolution of PB counts over time indicated that while hemoglobin levels and platelet counts quickly rose, neutrophil numbers remained below 1.0×109/l for a considerable time-period (Fig. 1 ). Repeated PB and BM evaluations by flow cytometry and BM biopsy histological and immunohistochemical examinations in the ensuing 6 months gave similar results.   2.2 Case 2 A 41-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IVB lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin’s disease (LPHD) in January 1999, predominantly diffuse and in part nodular, presenting with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and BM and liver infiltration. L&H cells were CD15?, CD30?, L26 (CD20ass)+CD79+, EMA+, CIg(?)+, CD3?, CD43?. He received six courses of the ABVD regimen, resulting in partial remission (histological evidence of disease in the liver and BM). Eventually, the patient attained CR with three BEACOPP courses; however, 2 months later (January 2000) he relapsed with stage IVB disease. He was then treated with Rituximab at 375mg/m2 in four weekly doses followed by two more doses at monthly intervals. The patient quickly became afebrile; furthermore, lymph node and spleen size progressively decreased and hematology values and liver function tests improved considerably (Fig. 2 ). On evaluation, 1 month post-Rituximab treatment, he was in CR. However, in the ensuing 4 months persistent neutropenia was noted (WBC ?1.8×109 to 3.5×109/l, neutrophils 15–30%; lymphocytes 55–70%; Fig. 2), albeit without infectious complications. On evaluation in May 2000, the BM biopsy showed a mild lymphocytic infiltration (?10%) both interstitially and in the form of two intramedullary aggregates. Lymphocytes were small or medium-sized; on immunohistochemistry they exhibited the same phenotypic features as described above for case #1; large CD20ass+ L&H cells were not observed. The myeloid series was slightly depressed with a left shift.  "
1249,S2311-3006(16)30002-7,Antecedent presentation of aplastic anemia in a patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma," 2 Case report A 50-year-old female presented with splenomegaly (24 cm) and pancytopenia in Mar. 2014. A bone marrow biopsy revealed hypocellular marrow (<5%). Biochemistry tests including ANA and anti-Ds-DNA were normal. Flow cytometry revealed no CD59/CD55 deficient clones. Aplastic anemia was diagnosed after serial work-ups. She initially received low dose prednisolone (10 mg/day). The hemogram improved but worsened again in Dec. 2014. On examinations showed white cell count (WBC) 810/ul; hemoglobin 7.0 g/dl; platelet count 64,000/ul, and lactate dehydrogenase 1041 U/L. An abdominal computed tomography revealed extensive lymphadenopathies mainly at retroperitoneum and massive splenomegaly, with biopsy proved DLBCL (Fig. 1 ). Repeated bone marrow biopsy again showed remarkable hypocellularity (Fig. 2 ). Concerning for profound myelosuppression, we delivered chemotherapy with standard dose R-COP regimen (rituximab; cyclophosphamide; vincistine, and oral prednisolone), and we skipped anthracycline for the first 3 cycles due to concern for profound marrow suppression. Long-acting filgrastim (pegylated granulocyte colony stimulating factor, [G-CSF]) was given 24 h after chemotherapy. The patient stood 3 cycles of R-COP very well and there was no occurrence of neutropenia. Interestingly, her WBC recovered shortly after the 1st cycle of R-COP (Fig. 3 ). Further 5 cycles of cytotoxic therapy with standard dose R-CEOP (rituximab; cyclophosphamide; epirubicin; vincistine, and oral prednisolone) regimen were given, and a follow-up abdomen CT showed marked decreased spleen size and resolution of previous lymphadenopathy (Fig. 4 ). PET-CT confirmed complete metabolic response (Fig. 5 ). We accomplished successful stem cell harvest after documented recovery of hematopoiesis (Fig. 6 ). Her HLA-DR typing revealed DRB1*12. "
1251,S0959-8049(11)01035-5,Allergy-associated symptoms in relation to childhood non-Hodgkin’s as contrasted to Hodgkin’s lymphomas: A case–control study in Greece and meta-analysis," 2 Materials and methods During the 11-year period between 1996–2008, 374 patients aged 0–14years with incident childhood lymphoma were newly diagnosed in all six paediatric haematology-oncology departments across Greece and contributed to NARECHEM. For administrative reasons, during specific time periods detailed datasets were not available in two of the participating departments, resulting in the exclusion of 67 patients (18%) from this study. An additional 30 patients (8%) were excluded due to refusals, incapacitation or abandonment of the child. Eventually a total of 277 incident lymphoma cases (166NHL and 111HL) were included in the analyses. For every child with lymphoma, a suitable control was individually matched on age (±6months) and sex among those hospitalised for minor paediatric ailments, in the same hospital and at the same time as the corresponding cases. Out of 277 control children, 135 were admitted for viral or other infections, such as pneumonia and axillary lymphadenitis, 59 for gastrointestinal or genitourinary conditions, such as gastroenteritis, abdominal pain and haematuria, 51 for cardiovascular or nervous system conditions namely, such as arrhythmia, transient loss of consciousness, febrile convulsions and headache, 14 for muscle-osteoarticular conditions, such as joint pain and myalgias and 18 for other conditions including accidental poisoning, obesity and diabetes mellitus. The guardians of all eligible children were informed of the study objectives and interviewed in person using a structured questionnaire covering socio-demographic, anthropometric, perinatal and selected medical history characteristics. Guardians were also asked to report the child’s history of allergy-associated symptoms/conditions (hereafter called “allergy”) including asthma, hay fever, eczema, allergies to food or medications or an allergic reaction severe enough to require urgent medical attention. To minimise the inclusion of “non-atopic wheezers” among those with a reported history of bronchiolitis or bronchitis, two paediatricians (SD, NS) blinded to case–control status reviewed the questionnaires as well as the medical records of each child. Thus, all eight children (3 NHL, 1HL and 4 controls) with reported wheezing symptoms below the age of 2years but no other history of allergic conditions were classified as non-allergic. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Athens University Medical School. Given that HL and NHL are distinct pathophysiologic entities, we performed separate analyses by lymphoma type. Frequency distributions of study variables were initially compared between childhood HL or NHL cases and their matched controls using chi-square tests for trend or contrasts. Subsequently, the data were modelled using multiple conditional logistic regression analyses, treating HL or NHL as the outcome variable and allergic conditions as well as a series of potential confounders as predictor variables. Covariates were coded as follows: days spent annually at seaside resorts (0, 1–14, 15–29 or 30+ days), birth weight (in 500g increments), birth order (continuous), maternal age at birth (in 5-year increments), maternal education (mandatory, lyceum, tertiary), maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes versus no), breastfeeding duration (in 2-month increments), residential crowding index (<0.50, 0.50 [reference] or >0.50rooms/person) and allergy presence (yes versus no). The SAS statistical package was used in all the analyses. 33   To maximise statistical power of the main end-point of our study, we estimated the combined odds ratios (OR) and 95%confidence intervals (CI) of the individual results regarding the association of asthma and lymphoma risk derived from our study and a national registry-based case control study (ESCALE) that was carried out in France comprising 128 cases of HL and 848 population controls (5–14years old), as well as 164 cases of NHL (2–14years old) and 1312 population controls. 32  The process was planned a priori and was statistically feasible, as two studies suffice for such an approach. 34  To avoid bias deriving from the different population groups or study designs, we combined the results using the fixed-effects (Mantel–Haenszel) model 35  after assessing the between-studies heterogeneity using Cochran Q statistic (at the 0.05 level of significance). Data were analysed with the SAS statistical software (SAS v9, SAS Institute, Carry, NC). "

Physical examination revealed lymph node involvement in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas, in the absence of liver and spleen enlargement. Routine blood cells analysis revealed leukocytosis (13.4×109/l) and lymphocytosis (10.3×109/l) at the expense of cells displaying lymphoplasmacytoid features and restricted surface immunoglobulin (sIg) ? light chain expression; peripheral blood hemoglobin levels and platelet counts were within the normal range. Routine blood biochemistry was normal and serum tryptase levels (CAP, Pharmacia, Sweden) were of 11ng/ml (normal ranges: <1 to 15ng/ml). In the BM aspirate (at diagnosis patient refused BM biopsy), together with a population of CD19+/sIg ?+ monoclonal B-lymphocytes, which accounted for 23% of the whole BM cellularity, morphologically abnormal BMMCs exhibiting elongated cytoplasmic extensions, an hypogranulated cytoplasm with focal granule accumulation (atypical MC type I) and an oval and eccentric nuclei [12] were observed. Multiparametric flow cytometry immunophenotypic studies of BMMC [13] performed at diagnosis (Table 1  and Fig. 1A and B ) showed the presence of 0.05% BMMC; all BMMC showed an aberrant immunophenotype [14–17] characterized by the expression of CD2 and CD25 (Fig. 1A), abnormally high levels of expression of the CD35 and CD69 antigens and decreased reactivity for CD117. Thus, the diagnosis of BM mastocytosis associated to a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was suspected according to recently established consensus criteria [18]. Due to the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, treatment with CVP and interferon-?-2b was started on January 2000, 6 months later the patient showed an objective response of his lymphoma. In contrast, no major changes were observed in the percentage of BMMC whose aberrant immunophenotypic features remained stable. Due to progression of lymphoma in November 2000, the patient was subsequently treated with intravenous cladribine (a 3h infusion given at a dose of 0.15mg/kg of body weight per day for five consecutive days). After five cycles an objective clinical response was attained with disappearance of the lymphadenopathies and a decrease of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count from 15.6×109 to 2.7×109/l. A BM trephine biopsy was performed in May 2001. In the BM 11% of clonal lymphocytes were detected; furthermore, an admixture of both morphologically normal and abnormal MC was found. In tryptase-stained BM sections small-size MC aggregates [19] were observed confirming the diagnosis of BM mastocytosis. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis revealed an overall percentage of BMMC of 0.02% and the presence of two distinct MC populations (Table 1 and Fig. 1C and D); a population comprising 60% of all BMMC (0.012% of all nucleated cells) showed the same abnormal immunophenotype as that of the BMMC detected at diagnosis. In contrast, the second MC population, representing 40% of all BMMC (0.008% of all nucleated BM cells), was negative for CD2, CD25, and CD35 showed dim expression of CD69 and higher reactivity for CD117, this phenotype being identical to that usually displayed by normal BMMC [14,15] (Fig. 1C and D).

1273,S0145-2126(10)00616-8,Hemophagocytic syndrome associated NK/T nasal type lymphoma presenting as hypereosinophilic syndrome: A case report and literature review," 2 Case report A 21-year-old Bolivian female was admitted for an elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. The patient had emmigrated from Bolivia to Spain 8 months prior to admission. Two months after her arrival she developed acute abdominal pain and fever and was diagnosed with complicated diverticulitis receiving initial medical management. However, it was then decided that surgical intervention would be necessary. Pre-operative assessment showed an eosinophilia (1990×103 mm?3) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (1067U/L) and LDH (706U/L). In the early post-operative period, two episodes of haemoperitoneum occurred leading to further emergency laparotomies. Histopathological investigation of the sigmoid colon at this time was unremarkable. On day 5 of the admission, the patient developed a high-grade fever. No focal signs of sepsis were found but the abdomen was diffusely distended without peritonism. Peripheral blood count revealed: haemoglobin 10.9g/dL; leucocytes 3.74×103 mm?3 (neutrophils 0.93; eosinophils 1.14×103 mm?3); platelets 150×103 mm?3; AST 43U/L; ALT 37U/L; GGT 852U/L; LDH 1067U/L; triglycerides 288mg/dL; vitamin B12 266pg/ml; serum tryptase <1mcg/L; PT 16.4s; APPT 44s; fibrinogen 206mg/dL. Renal function parameters as well as electrolytes were within normal ranges. Broad spectrum antibacterial drugs were started empirically and an abdominal CT scan was ordered with the suspicion of post-operative intrabdominal infection. This showed a normal sized liver with several scattered focal lesions (Fig. 1 ) and a heterogeneous splenomegaly (20cm). At that time intravenous fluconazole was added to the treatment regimen. Daily pyrexial episodes persisted despite broad-spectrum antimicrobials and an extensive diagnostic work up was initiated. Blood and urine cultures, HIV, HBV, HCV, HAV, Salmonella, Toxocara, Amoeba, Cysticercosis, Lesihmania, Fasciola, Chagas disease and Borrelia serologies were negative. Anti-EBNA IgG and CMV IgG were positive. ELISA was positive for Echinococcosis. Stool microscopy for ova and parasites was negative and stool culture did not reveal any pathogens. On day 23 a percutaneous liver biopsy showed diffuse eosinophil infiltration of hepatic parenchyma and areas of focal necrosis without evidence of parasites. Two days later, a bone marrow biopsy showed an extensive eosinophil infiltration. FIP1L1/PDGFRA mutations were negative and evidence of clonal eosinophilia was not found by HUMARA. Despite no evidence of tissue-infiltrating parasites they were empirically treated with antihelminths although there was no significant improvement. On day 29 the patient started to complain of oropharyngeal pain which on examination showed an exudative and ulcerated left tonsil (Fig. 2 ). Biopsy of the tonsil found eosinophil infiltration and areas of necrosis. Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) was considered and prednisolone (1mg/kg) was started. However there was no significant response. On day 38 imatinib was commenced but was discontinued on day 45 due to the development of pulmonary oedema. The patient remained intermittently febrile with anaemia requiring blood transfusions. A second bone marrow biopsy showed haemophagocytosis, eosinophilia and foci of non-granulomatous necrosis surrounded by CD3+ lymphocytes with a predominance of CD4 positivity over CD8, CD20?, perforin+ and granzyme B+. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) titres were highly positive (3×106 mL?1) and IV immunoglobulin and acyclovir were administered with a one log drop in the plasma viral load over the following 10 days. Further biopsy of the left tonsil confirmed a diagnosis of NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. At this point, IV ciclophosphamide 450mg, vincristine 2mg and dexamethasone 40mg QDS were started. The patient developed rectal bleeding requiring emergency surgery for a spontaneous transverse colon perforation. During the procedure a biopsy was taken with histopathological reports proving compatible with NHL-T/NK infiltration. The patient died on day 100 after admission. "

On physical examination, splenomegaly was also detected. Computed tomography scan showed multiple axilar, mediastinic, precarinal, retroperitoneal, and para-aortic lymphadenopathies. A biochemistry profile revealed a serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level within the normal range and a ?-2-microglobulin level of 9.4 mg/L (reference range, 0.6 to 2.4 mg/L). Hematologic data showed a hemoglobin level of 136 g/dL, along with 10.8×109/L leucocytes, 5.800×109/L lymphocytes, and 208×109/L platelets. Peripheral blood lymphography revealed 17% mature lymphocytes with clumped chromatin (grumelée), 70% lymphocytes with lymphoplasmocytic differentiation, 6% lymphocytes with evident nucleolus, and 7% large granular lymphocytes (Fig 1; PB).  Fig. 1  LN: Biopsy of an inguinal lymph node showing an infiltration of tumoral B lymphocytes, with wide and pale cytoplasm, a single nucleus with a central nucleolus, the so-called paraimmunoblastic cells. (Hematoxylin and eosin; original magnification ×400). PB: The right side of the image shows a peripheral blood smear with a mature lymphocyte with clumped chromatin and another lymphocyte with a nucleolus and a wide cytoplasm. (May-Grünwald Giemsa; original magnification ×1000.).    A flow cytometry immunophenotype of peripheral blood cells yielded the following results: positivity for CD5/CD19, CD23, and CD38; negativity for CD10, FMC7, CD25, and CD11c; lambda light chain restriction; and weak SmIg positivity. A bone marrow aspirate showed a diffuse atypical lymphoid infiltration of 29%, with the same morphology as in peripheral blood. Inguinal lymph node biopsy revealed interfollicular infiltration of tumoral B lymphocytes, with wide and pale cytoplasm and a single nucleus with a central nucleolus, the so-called paraimmunoblastic cells (Fig 1; LN). An immunophenotypic profile of the bone marrow yielded the same results as in peripheral blood except for CD38. Immunohistochemic results in the lymph node were CD20, CD79a, CD23, CD5, and IgM (surface) positivity and IgD (surface) negativity. Overexpression of p53 was seen in 60% to 70% of tumoral cells, but cyclin D1 expression was not detected. The diagnosis of atypical CLL (lymphoplasmacytic variant) was established in peripheral blood and a paraimmunoblastic variant of SLL/CLL was identified in the lymph nodes. 1   Cytogenetic analyses of several tissues were performed. A 72-hour peripheral blood tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)-stimulated culture showed the following karyotype: 46,XY[5]/43,X,-Y,del(4)(p15),6,add(17)(p13),-18,der(20)t(18;20)(q11;p11)[15] (Fig 2).  Fig. 2  Image showing a 43,X,-Y,del(4)(p15),-6,add(17)(p13),-8, der(20)t(18;20)(q11;p11) karyotype.    A 24-hour bone marrow culture showed a normal 46,XY karyotype in 16 metaphases and a 72-hour lymph node TPA-stimulated culture revealed the same abnormal karyotype as found in peripheral blood in 10 metaphases. Karyotypes were described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN 1995). 5   Conventional FISH studies were performed using 3 different probes. LSI IgH/BCL-2 and LSI IgH/BCL-1 dual-color, dual-fusion translocation probes (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) were applied on TPA-cultured peripheral blood cells; no translocations were detected. In addition, a spectrum orange-labeled 17p13.1 DNA probe (p53 locus) (Vysis) was used to confirm a p53 deletion found in 61% of TPA cultured peripheral blood nuclei. A minimum of 200 nuclei per case were scored. CGH was performed on peripheral blood tumoral DNA following the manufacturer's instructions (Vysis) with modifications. The image analysis was performed with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 600; Nikon, Japan) and image analysis software (Cytovision; Applied Imaging, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K.) The ratio of spectrum green/spectrum red fluorescence intensities was calculated along each individual chromosome. Ratio values obtained from 10 metaphase spreads were averaged, and the resulting profile was plotted next to the ideogram. Heterochromatic regions (the entire chromosome Y, 19, and 22 and 1p regions) were excluded from the final calculation because they are known to be critical in CGH. In our case, CGH showed gains on 4q and losses on 6p, 6q, 17p, 20p, and 20q (Fig 3).  Fig. 3  CGH profile of a case affected with paraimmunoblastic variant of SLL/CLL. Gains on 4q and losses on 6p, 6q, 17p, 20p, and 20q can be observed.      The patient received treatment and is now in partial remission after a year. "
1284,S2173-5794(17)30020-8,Proptosis as initial manifestation of Burkitt's lymphoma with orbital involvement," Clinic case report Female, 35, who visited the emergency department referring right ocular pain with 2 months evolution and increased intensity in the last 48h. For a few weeks, said pain associated frontal pain which did not remit with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Personal history included smoking habit, denying the use of other toxic substances or known systemic diseases. Patient was in treatment with oral iron due to chronic anemia and in the past 2 months had lost 5kg of weight without loss of appetite. Ophthalmological history included right amblyopia due to strabismus with surgery during childhood and no subsequent checkups. The general appearance of the patient indicated poor health. Ophthalmological examination of the right eye showed proptosis with temporal and inferior displacement of the ocular globe as well as limited ocular motility in all positions except infraduction. Periocular tissue was edematous. The left eye was normal (Fig. 1 ). The patient did not refer diplopia or diminished visual acuity, which was of hand movement in the right eye and of one in the left with myopic correction. Pupil was isochoric, with right relative afferent pupil defect. Ocular fundus exploration evidenced marked vascular tortuosity and right papillary edema (Fig. 2 ). Orbital computerized action tomography (CAT) was urgently requested, which evidenced an apparently aggressive extraconal medial lesion in the right orbit that eroded the ethmoidal lamina papyracea and occupied the ethmoidal cells, associating occupation of the frontal sinuses. There was no association of inflammatory changes in the intra- or extraconal fat (Fig. 3A and B). The differential diagnostics suggested by radiology were sarcoma or lymphoma, although this was not the typical presentation site of the latter. The patient was admitted for complete studies and to initiate treatment. Blood analyses identified moderate normocytic anemia (hemoglobine 9.5g/dl), slight lymphopenia and monocitopenia. Biopsy of the tumor was carried out endonasally and diagnosed as Burkitt's lymphoma (Fig. 4 ). Serologic results were positive for HIV, confirmed by means of Western blot. "
1285,S0041-1345(10)01262-5,Fatal Sclerosing Peritonitis Associated With Primary Effusion Lymphoma After Liver Transplantation: A Case Report,"Several registry 2–4  and single-center reports 5–8  have shown trends toward increased incidences of certain types of posttransplantation de novo malignancies, principally those linked to viral causes. Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a widely recognized complication of solid organ transplantation with a myriad of clinical presentations. Although the majority of PTLDs are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (usually type A), 9–11  up to 30% are EBV-negative 12–14  of unknown etiology. Some of these may be cases when EBV is no longer detectable, where as the others are due to other unknown viruses. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8–associated PTLD has been reported, including posttransplantation primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). 15–17  Whether HHV-8 complications are the result of reactivation in the recipient during immunosuppression or transmission of infected cells from the donor is still under debate. To date, in Italy the HHV-8 serological profile is not routinely performed on donor candidates for or recipients of liver transplantation."
1286,S2152-2650(12)00132-2,Rapid Neurologic Decline in a Patient With Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma: A Case of Leptomeningeal Lymphomatosis," Case and Introduction A 62-year-old African American man presented to the emergency department with subacute onset of abdominal distention, massive ascites, and shortness of breath. He had no B-symptoms and no neurologic symptoms or deficits. Results of a paracentesis and cytologic examination revealed innumerable large cells with round, oval, or irregularly shaped nuclei with moderate amounts of dark blue cytoplasm. Flow cytometry confirmed a malignant population of CD2+, CD3+, CD5+ and T-cell receptor (TCR)-alpha/beta positive cells with a virtual absence of other lymphocytes. Molecular analysis confirmed a clonal T-cell population. There was an absence of anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein on immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus related RNA did not demonstrate hybridization signals. Staging evaluation with computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse adenopathy with a large right pleural effusion. Staging positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrate fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; diffuse peritoneal FDG avidity; and a mild-to-moderate FDG avidity in the humeral head, which corresponded to a lucent lesion noted on CT. A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate was relatively normal, with only a 1% immunophenotypically aberrant lymphoid population suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, involvement by peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Flow cytometry revealed expression of CD3 and CD4, and loss of the pan-T-cell antigen CD7 in this subset of cells. A lumbar puncture was negative for malignant cells. Significant laboratory abnormalities included a serum LDH level higher than 1000 ?/L, and an ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level higher than 7000 ?/L. The patient was given a final diagnosis of stage IVA PTCL-not otherwise specified (NOS). The patient started systemic treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy and had a brisk clinical response, with improvement in his ascites and shortness of breath. A mid treatment CT to assess response was done after 3 cycles and showed a significant improvement, with near complete resolution of all previous sites of disease. Up until that time, central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with intravenous methotrexate (MTX) had been deferred due to concerns about third-spacing and MTX accumulation. Plans were made to start CNS prophylaxis during cycle 4 of CHOP chemotherapy. The patient presented to the clinic for cycle 4 of chemotherapy and had new-onset right seventh and left partial third nerve palsies that manifested as facial weakness, exotropia, and diplopia. He reported headache that was most pronounced when lying flat. Results of a history and physical examination were consistent with multifocal CNS lesions and increased intracranial pressure, which raised suspicion for a process within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space. At the time of the onset of neurologic symptomatology, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord, with and without contrast, revealed no abnormalities. Lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF cytology showed atypical lymphocytes consistent with his known diagnosis of PTCL (Figure 1). The patient received systemic high-dose MTX, 3500 mg/m2, and intrathecal MTX, 24 mg with stabilization of his neurologic symptoms. He also received systemic corticosteroids, dexamethasone 4 mg every 6 hours. The patient developed systemic infection and died 30 days after the CSF cytopathologic diagnosis of lymphoma involvement.

1290,S2152-2650(11)70051-9,Complete Remission in Two Cases of Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Treated With Hyper-CVAD: A Case Report and Review of the Literature," Case Reports  Patient 1 Patient 1 is a 60-year-old male of Caribbean descent with a past medical history remarkable for mild coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic onychomycosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and gastroesophageal reflux who presented with fevers, night sweats, fatigue, and anorexia. His white blood cell count (WBC) was 91.1 × 109/L (normal range: 3.5-11.0 × 109/L), with 83% lymphocytes. His hemoglobin was 14.3 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-16 g/dL) and platelet count was 154 × 109/L (normal range: 150-400 × 109/L). Physical examination showed multiple bilateral palpable small neck lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the laboratory values were significant for elevated transaminases, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 160 IU/L (normal range: 10-42 IU/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 245 IU/L (normal range: 6-45 IU/L); LDH, 574 IU/L (normal range: 50-175 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase, 323 IU/L (normal range: 40-130 IU/L); total bilirubin, 2.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.2-1.3 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 1.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.0-0.3 mg/dL); and calcium, 15.5 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL). A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a markedly enlarged liver consistent with diffuse involvement with leukemia with small mesenteric lymphadenopathy. A subset of the lymphoid cells examined in peripheral blood had markedly lobulated “flower-like” nuclei. On the bone marrow examination, approximately 25%-35% neoplastic lymphoid cells with a similar morphology were identified. There was prominent osteoclastic activity noted. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood, identified a predominant (95%) population of CD2+, surface CD3–, cytoplasmic CD3+, CD5+ T-lymphoid cells that were CD7–, CD4+, CD25+, had partial expression of HLA-DR and CD56, and minimal expression of CD30. They were negative for CD34, CD8, CD16, and CD57. Molecular studies detected T-cell receptor B gene rearrangements in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. The presence of HTLV-1 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Cytogenetics performed on the bone marrow aspirate showed a complex karyotype: 48XY,t(1;3)(q31;24),+3,+3, add(8)(q11.1),–10, del(13)(q12q22), del(16)(q22), +mar[10]/46,XY[11]. On hospital day 4, the patient's total bilirubin rose to 4.4 mg/dL and he was treated urgently with CHOP chemotherapy at standard doses for 1 cycle before his formal diagnosis. By day 21, his WBC responded only minimally with decrease to 27 × 109/L with 72% abnormal lymphocytes. He had persistence of his hepatomegaly. His treatment course was complicated by difficult-to-control hypercalcemia during the first 21 days of his treatment, requiring multiple doses of intravenous pamidronate and aggressive diuresis. After the diagnosis of acute ATLL was determined, the patient's treatment was changed to the hyper-cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (CVAD) regimen starting on cycle 2 with prophylactic valacyclovir, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluconazole. Within 10 days of his initial cycle of hyper-CVAD, his WBC and lymphocyte number normalized and his calcium level normalized. His hepatomegaly resolved as well. His course was also remarkable for a decrease in his ejection fraction to 37% with a clinical episode of congestive heart failure. It was felt that this was because of a coronary artery event and not doxorubicin related. He also developed a persistent mild renal insufficiency, creatinine level 1.34-1.80 mg/dL (0.4-1.3 mg/dL). As a consequence of these complications, his treatment regimen was shortened to 6 cycles (he received 3 cycles of hyper-CVAD part A and 3 cycles of hyper-CVAD part B) instead of 8 total planned cycles. The patient achieved a complete clinical remission with this regimen. He then underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from his matched brother and remains in clinical remission over 18 months after diagnosis.   Patient 2 Patient 2 is a 59-year-old Caribbean woman with a medical history remarkable for total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy for cervical cancer, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, who presented with a history of 2 months of intermittent abdominal pain. Physical examination showed a palpable midepigastric abdominal mass, but no hepatosplenomegaly or peripheral lymphadenopathy. Laboratory studies were remarkable for a normal creatinine and blood counts. Liver function tests including AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin were normal with the exception of the ALT which was 58 IU/L. Lactate dehydrogenase was 616 IU/L. Abdominal CT scans revealed extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy predominantly in the superior aspect of the retroperitoneum, between the aorta and infrahepatic inferior vena cava. A retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy showed a monotonous infiltrate of medium-to-large-sized lymphoid cells with angulated nuclei, finely granular chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. By flow cytometry, the neoplastic cells were CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, and lacked CD7 expression and, by immunohistochemistry, the lesional cells were CD3+ and negative for CD34, TdT, CD99, CD1a, ALK-1, CD30, EMA, CD10, and CD21. The proliferation rate as highlighted with the MIB-1 antibody was nearly 95%. An initial enzyme immuno assay (EIA) study was reactive for HTLV-I/II, and the presence of HTLV-I was confirmed by Western Blot. Molecular studies identified T-cell receptor B gene rearrangements in both the peripheral blood and lymph node biopsy. A diagnosis of lymphomatous ATLL was made. The patient's bone marrow was only minimally involved by the neoplastic process. The patient was in intense abdominal pain secondary to her tumor; hence, she was treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy before a formal diagnosis. Her abdominal pain persisted for the following 3 weeks. After the diagnosis of ATLL was made, the treatment was then revised, and the hyper-CVAD regimen was begun on day 21. Prophylactic medications, valacyclovir, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluconazole accompanied the chemotherapy. After the initial cycle of hyper-CVAD her abdominal pain rapidly resolved. She underwent a total of 8 cycles of hyper-CVAD. Four doses of intrathecal methotrexate for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis were given. The patient had restaging studies after her fourth cycle and was in a complete remission. She remains in remission 12 months after her treatment.  "
1295,S0039-6257(16)30024-8,Bilateral ocular panadnexal mass as initial presentation of systemic blastoid variant of mantle-cell lymphoma," 2 Case report  2.1 Clinical findings A 66-year-old man presented in October, 2013, with a 9-month history of slowly enlarging, bilateral (synchronous and relatively symmetrical, but with the right side more prominent), painless, periorbital, and orbital swelling/mass. The patient also presented with mechanical ptosis, proptosis, and downward dystopia (nonaxial proptosis) more severe on his right side, chemosis that was severe on the right side, with exudation and conjunctival keratinization, and lagophthalmos with exposure keratopathy that was also more severe in the right eye (Fig. 1 A). There was almost complete loss of vision in his right eye and decreased visual acuity in his left eye. Symptoms also included a feeling of resistance, irritation, and weight loss of 15 kg. On initial examination, he had light perception without accurate projection in the right eye and 20/60 acuity in his left eye, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. His intraocular pressures were 30 mm Hg right eye and 32 mm Hg left eye. Exposure keratopathy and chemosis, with sticky hard exudate and keratinization, were more pronounced on the right side. Eye movements were restricted. The posterior segments of both eyes were unremarkable. A multislice computerized tomography scan (Fig. 1B) showed a bilateral, homogeneous, expansile, enhancing, well-demarcated, solid, periorbital and orbital mass of soft-tissue density, mainly in the superotemporal quadrant, with involvement of the lacrimal gland, superior and lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, optic nerve, and lacrimal sac. There was no CNS or sinonasal involvement. Laboratory investigations showed elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (612 U/L, normal 220–460), low hemoglobin (115 g/L, normal 138–175), low serum calcium (2.00 mmol/L, normal 2.15–2.65), high white cell count (22.17 × 109/L, normal 3.4–9.7), low neutrophil count (34.9 × 109/L, normal 44–72), high lymphocyte count (55.6 × 109/L, normal 20–46), low platelet count (0.003/L, normal 0.158–0.425), low red blood cell count (4.01 × 109/L, normal 4.34–5.72), and low hematocrit (0.349%, normal 0.415–0.530). The patient's past medical history was significant only for low-grade hypothyroidism without substitution therapy. He had worked for 35 years at a paint and varnish factory, and his father died of bone cancer at the age of 70 years. There was no history of Sjögren syndrome, Mikulicz syndrome, IgG4-related disease, Graves disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, bullous pemphigoid, or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The serologies for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses were all negative. There was no prior history of lymphoma. No pathologic skin lesions were present. At presentation, enlarged cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph glands were found. The spleen was nonpalpable. A chest X ray and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography were within normal limits. The clinical diagnosis was bilateral ocular adnexal lesion suspected of being a lymphoproliferative malignancy, with an International Prognostic Index 5 (high intermediate risk) and a Performance Score (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) >1. A transcutaneous, transpalpebral incisional surgical biopsy of the periorbital part of the tumor on both sides was performed under local anesthesia, and the specimens were sent for histopathological evaluation.   2.2 Histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings After fixation in 10% buffered formalin, the 2 biopsy specimens were whitish-yellowish pieces of tissue, measuring 1.5 cm × 1.1 cm × 0.5 cm and 1.7 cm × 1.1 cm × 0.7 cm, respectively. Microscopy examination (Fig. 2 A) revealed a relatively uniform, hypercellular, diffuse, and slightly nodular, malignant lymphoid proliferation of intermediate-sized cells. The cells showed angulated, cleaved, irregular or round nuclear contours, finely dispersed nuclear chromatin, small nucleoli, and a narrow rim of cytoplasm. The cells were limited to the zone surrounding the residual germinal centers that could still be recognized. There was no necrosis. Hyalinized small-sized blood vessels were also present. Immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 2B-D) demonstrated diffuse and strong positivity for cyclin D1, CD5, CD20, CD44, CD79a, MUM-1, and Bcl-2, with scattered focal moderate positivity for Bcl-6, p53 (<20% of cells), IgM, and lambda light chain > kappa light chain, and a very high percentage of nuclear staining for Ki-67 (60%–80%). The tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD10, CD15, CD23, CD30, CD56, CD68, CD138, IgG, and TdT. Among the tumor cells were a moderate number of small T cells (CD3+) and histiocytes (CD68+). A relatively disorganized meshwork (alternating loosely structured and tight clusters) of follicular dendritic cells (CD23+) was prominent. Based on the morphology, histopathological features and the immunohistochemical profile, a diagnosis of bilateral ocular adnexal mantle-cell lymphoma of the blastoid variant was thought most likely. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on formalin-fixed tissue specimens, using LSI IGH/CCND1 dual fusion DNA probe. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed 35% of spread single cells with t(11; 14) (q13; q32) translocation (Fig. 3 ).   2.3 Therapy and follow-up The patient was referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and treatment. A bone marrow biopsy was also positive for a lymphoproliferative malignancy, with paratrabecular and centromedular neoplastic growth. He was staged according to TNM seventh edition and Ann Arbor staging system as follows: T3N3M1c, pT3M1b, IVB. After 8 cycles of immune-chemotherapy (R-CHOP: rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) at the regional oncology center, all ocular adnexal tumor manifestations had disappeared or regressed significantly. The patient did not experience an OAR bMCL recurrence after 11 months of ophthalmic follow-up. In September 2014, generalized lymphadenopathy and bilateral proptosis recurred, with worsening of the patient's general condition. In October, 2014, R-DHAP regimen (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) was introduced for 1 cycle of immune-chemotherapy. In November, 2014, 13 months after presentation, the patient died from massive pleural effusion, chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, neutropenic fever, and heart failure.  "

Physical examination showed splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy. A complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.5g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 58.1×109/L, platelet count of 74×109/L, and 8% blasts. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed hepatosplenomegaly, bilateral tonsil enlargement, and multiple enlargements of intraabdominal, retroperitoneal, axillary, and cervical LNs. Histopathologic examination of a cervical LN revealed T-lymphoblastic lymphoma with a monotonous replacement of nodal architecture by T-lymphoblasts (Fig. 1A). Lymphoblasts expressed CD3, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and CD34, and were negative for CD20 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) (Fig. 1B). The BM was hypercellular (100% cellularity), with prominent myeloid hyperplasia (an M/E ratio of 13:1) (Fig. 1C). The differential was as follows: 24% neutrophils, 2% eosinophils, 14% metamyelocytes, 17% myelocytes, 4% promyelocytes, 15% myeloblasts, 13% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 6% erythroblasts. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the blasts revealed positive expression of MPO (61%), CD13 (91%), CD33 (79%), CD34 (69%), CD117 (47%) and negative expression of CD2, CD5, CD7, CD56, CD10, CD19, CD20, and TdT. Interestingly, BM biopsy revealed several well-demarcated nodular aggregates of undefined cells with fibroblast-like morphology (Fig. 1D). The nodular aggregates of these spindle-shaped cells were stained positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin in addition to deposits of reticulin and collage, and stained negative for MPO, CD117, CD3, CD20, and TdT (Fig. 1D). The observed aggregates were markedly hypervascular, as shown by CD34 staining (Fig. 1E). In order to assess if these cells were mesenchymal stem cells, staining with monoclonal antibody against endoglin (CD105, DAKO, Caripinteria, CA) were performed, which revealed inconclusive results, showing a weak reaction that could not be distinguished from a diffuse background signal. Notably, diffuse interstitial and patchy infiltration of CD20+/TdT+ lymphoid cells into the area surrounding the nodular structures was prominent; however, these infiltrating CD20+ B-lymphocytes were negative for CD3, suggesting the infiltrating lymphocytes in the BM were not metastatic T-lymphoblasts from the cervical LN (Fig. 1F). T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene clonality assays for BM and LN cells were performed using multiplex PCR (InVivoScirbe Technology, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described [2]. Both assays showed germline configurations with no monoclonal peak. A conventional G-banding study of BM cells showed the karyotype of 47,XY,t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2), +19[16]/46,XY[1] (Fig. 2A). An interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study using the BCR/ABL probe (LSI dual color, dual fusion translocation probe, Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Des Plaines, IL) was consistent with t(8;22) translocation, showing a split signal of the BCR probe in 70.5% of cells (three green BCR gene signals and two orange ABL gene signals). The translocation partner of the BCR gene was confirmed by metaphase FISH analysis using an AML1/ETO probe (LSI dual color, dual fusion translocation probe), which showed a translocated BCR signal at der(8) (Fig. 2B). FISH analysis using 19q13/19p13 FISH probe (dual color probe, Abbott Molecular/Vysis) on BM cells showed trisomy 19 in 95% of cells. FISH analysis using a BCR-ABL probe in paraffin-embedded cervical LN tissue revealed three green signals of the BCR probe among 30% of LN cells, and 19q13/19p13 FISH probe revealed trisomy 19 in about half of LN cells (Fig. 2C). In order to confirm the BCR-FGFR1 rearrangement, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on RNA extracted from BM aspirates (RNeasy Mini Kit; QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to a previously described procedure [3]. The expected amplification band of 642-bp was clearly detected, and sequencing of the product confirmed the presence of a fusion transcription of BCR exon 4 and FGFR1 exon 9 (Fig. 3 ). In order to further investigate the presence of BCR-FGFR1 rearrangement in the cervical LN tissue, RNA from archival paraffin-embedded LN tissue was extracted with a nucleic acid isolation kit (Ambion, Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA), and RT-PCR was performed using the same protocol as that used for the BM cells; however, the BCR-FGFR1 fusion transcription was not detected despite the presence of the 450-bp band of human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (hGAPDH) gene, which was used as an internal control (Fig. 3). After diagnosis, the patient underwent chemotherapy with cytarabine, daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. After 2 months of treatment, cytogenetic analysis demonstrated persistent (8;22)(p11;q11) translocation (46,XY,t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2)[3]/47,sl, +19[2]/46,XY[13]) and the three signals of the BCR probe in 7.5% of cells by FISH study. The patient then underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and subsequent BM examination revealed a normal //46,XY[20] karyotype. "

1318,S0737-0806(11)00670-8,Pathological Findings in a Case of Equine T-Cell Lymphoma Associated with Ataxia," 2 Case Report A 15-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding with no history of neurological or locomotor disease underwent surgery to remove masses in the right upper eyelid (Fig. 1 ). The removed tissue was diagnosed histopathologically as lymphoma. The lymphoma recurred in the left lower and right lower and third eyelids, and a second surgery was performed 48 days after the first removal. The horse was comfortable thereafter and returned to its previous discipline, but subcutaneous masses were palpable on the left auricle and the right nasal vestibule, and edema of the lower limbs and the preputium was apparent 3 months after the first surgery. One hundred thirteen days later after the first surgery, the horse developed sudden incoordination and hindlimb stumbling, and these signs progressed rapidly over 5 days. Because of the poor prognosis, the horse was humanely destroyed and subjected to necropsy. At necropsy, in the section from the first cervical vertebra to the seventh thoracic vertebra, yellow-white or dark reddish-brown masses were found adhering to the outer surface of the spinal dura mater (Fig. 2 ). In the epidural space, the adipose tissue had decreased in volume and had been replaced by the masses. The masses were mainly seen in the ventral spinal cord and were a maximum of 15 mm thick. Near the first cervical and seventh thoracic vertebrae, the spinal cord had changed markedly in shape as a result of compression by the masses filling the epidural space. These masses were not bound to the inner surface of the spinal canal. At the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints, many brown or yellow-brown masses (maximum 2.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm3) adhered to the synovial surface close to the articular capsule attachments and the inner articular fossae adjacent to the articular surfaces (eg, trochanteric fossa, coronoid fossa) (Fig. 3 ). In the lower left eyelid, a subcutaneous mass (4.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm3) was observed along the ventral margin of the orbit. Similar masses were found in the right upper, lower, and third eyelids and the periorbital fat body. All the masses that appeared in the joints and around the eyes were red to light reddish-brown and solid. In the larynx, flattened, tan, solid masses approximately 2 cm in diameter were observed cranial to the right vestibule and caudal to the rear of the intermembranous part of the vocal fold. These masses continued under the vocal fold. Small solid masses (<1 cm in diameter) were scattered under the skin of both thoracolumbar parts of body; in cross-section, the masses were solid and tan. There were similar masses in the subcutaneous tissues of the nasal vestibule and pinnae. The mandibular, retropharyngeal, axillary, superficial inguinal, deep inguinal, and lateral iliac lymph nodes were markedly enlarged (maximum 10.0× 5.0 × 2.0 cm3); they were solid and dark reddish-brown or yellow-white. The masses, spinal cord, and enlarged lymph nodes were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed routinely, and embedded in paraffin. The tissue was sectioned at 3-?m thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson trichrome, Giemsa, Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen, silver, and phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin. Sections of the spinal cord were further stained with Luxol fast blue. Tissue sections were also evaluated immunohistochemically for the expression of CD 3 and CD 79 alpha. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with peroxidase-labeled polymer (Envision, DAKO Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and the sites of primary antibody binding were visualized with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine used as a chromogen. To promote antigen retrieval, the slides were placed in antigen-retrieval solution (Target retrieval solution, DAKO Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and heated in an autoclave for 15 minutes at 121°C. The primary antibodies used were polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD3 (DAKO Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan. 1:300 dilution) and monoclonal mouse anti-human CD79 alpha (DAKO Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan. 1:200 dilution). After immunohistochemical staining, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The masses located on the outer surface of the spinal dura mater and in the joints were composed of small or medium-sized lymphocyte-like tumor cells arranged in sheets. A fine network of reticular fibers was also present among the tumor cells (Fig. 4 ). The masses contained many small vessels and small amounts of adipose tissue. Most of the tumor cells were small and had clumped chromatin and scant cytoplasm. The medium-sized tumor cells were round or polygonal, with round, granular nuclei and moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures were rarely observed. There were moderate infiltrations of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells that occasionally ingested the surrounding tumor cells (Fig. 5 ). Some of the multinucleated giant cells contained needle-like eosinophilic structures within their cytoplasm; these structures were also stained with phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (Fig. 6 ). However, no microorganisms were found out by using Giemsa, Gram, or Ziehl-Neelsen staining. The tumor cells mildly infiltrated the spinal dura mater adjacent to the tumor masses, but they did not reach the subdural space and were not observed in the spinal fluid extracted at necropsy. Throughout the spinal cord, enlargement or loss of nerve axons, dilation of periaxonal spaces, and macrophage infiltration of the periaxonal spaces were observed, mainly in the ventral funiculus. In the portions of cervical spinal cord nerves that were buried in the tumor masses, tumor cells and/or macrophages had infiltrated among the bands of nerve fibers, and severe swelling of the nerve axons was observed (Fig. 7 ). The masses located in the eyelids, laryngeal wall, and skin contained clusters of tumor cells and macrophages similar to those in the masses in the spinal dura mater and the joints. The masses were indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue, and occasionally, the tumor cells and macrophages infiltrated diffusely into the adjacent muscular and glandular tissues. In most of the enlarged lymph nodes, although the follicular architecture had disappeared because of the accumulation of tumor cells, the sinus and trabecular architectures remained. In the present case, the tumor cells were small to medium-sized, as were the other masses, and there were moderate infiltrations of the lymph sinuses with macrophages and multinucleated cells. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells proliferating in the masses and lymph nodes expressed CD3 antigen but did not express CD79 alpha antigen (Fig. 8 ). "

She had received treatment with leflunomide for 10 years and infliximab for 2 years for rheumatoid arthritis. Secondary Felty’s syndrome has appeared. Infliximab had been discontinued six months before, when pancytopenia was disclosed. On abdominal ultrasound homogeneous hepato-splenomegaly associated with Felty’s syndrome was found. A 5cm mass was observed in the right atrium on computed tomography. On trans-esophageal echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging, a mass of tissue arising from the right atrium was seen (Fig. 1 ), hypermetabolic (SUV=39) on positron emission tomography. White blood cell count was 3.32×109/l, with an absolute neutrophil count of 1.5×109/l, hemoglobin level of 95g/l and a platelet count of 294×109/l. Bone marrow biopsy was within normal limits.

He had received a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis 5 years before and at the last follow-up cardiologic visit (5 months earlier) he was classified in New York Heart Association class II, on the basis of symptoms (absence of dyspnea during ordinary activity). ECG showed sinus rhythm and echocardiograpy a moderate left atrium enlargement, a Doppler estimated mean aortic gradient of 22 mmHg with moderate regurgitation. Physical examination on admission revealed a well nourished man with dyspnea at rest. Vital signs were blood pressure 110/70, irregular pulse of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 per min. Jugular veins distention, decreased breath sound in both lung bases, a rough ejection murmur at the base of the heart and modest generalized edema were appreciated. Chest-X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions. ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation and a complete right bundle block. Transthoracic echocardiography showed moderate pericardial effusion and a thickened right ventricular free wall, within which it seemed to appreciate a mass (Fig. 1 ). Cytologic analysis of large amount of pericardial fluid showed large cells suspicious for a lymphoproliferative disorder. CT scan indicated a thick pericardium with no evidence of cardiac mass. At thoracotomy, a firm mass infiltrating the wall of right atrium and ventricle was appreciated and biopsied. Biopsy of thickened pericardium was also obtained. Microscopic examination disclosed a diffuse proliferation of large atypical lymphoid cells with vescicolous nuclei showing prominent nucleoli (Fig. 2 ). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a clonally restricted (intracytoplasmic IgM? positive) population of large neoplastic lymphoid cells, which were CD19, CD20, CD22, CD38 and FMC7 positive and had a high proliferative activity. Pericardial specimens showed neoplastic lymphomatous infiltration. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (WHO Classification) infiltrating myocardium and pericardium was diagnosed. Staging for NHL with whole body CT scan and bone marrow biopsy was negative. Laboratory findings were normal except for increased LDH (540 U/l, normal range 250–450 U/l). One week after surgery, chemotherapy with cyclophoshamide, vincristine and prednisone (COP) was started. After several hours of clinical stability, the patient developed refractory ventricular tachycardia with hypotension and, despite appropriate therapy, died 22 h after chemotherapy. "

Two months before, MR imaging of his entire spinal cord revealed no abnormalities. At the age of 50years, the patient was incidentally diagnosed as having chronic ATL. Serum analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 11,500/dl (16% of which were abnormal lymphocytes), an LDH level of 323IU/l, and concentration of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level of 2,530U/ml. Serum BUN, albumin,and Ca levels were within normal limits. The acquired abdominal computed tomography (CT) images showed mild lymphadenopathy only in the axillary regions. Galium-67 scintigraphy of the whole body showed mild uptake in the regions corresponding to the above-mentioned axillary regions. These findings did not change over five years. Serum analysis of anti-aquaporin-4 and anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies showed negative results. His CSF demonstrated 15 white blood cells/?l (lymphocytes without abnormal lymphocyte cells) and a total protein level of 90mg/dl. The titer of the anti-HTLV-1 antibody was determined to be 1.8 in CSF by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). His CSF anti-sIL2 antibody level was 351U/ml. Spinal cord MR imaging revealed a high signal intensity in T2-weighted sequences and swelling from C6 to T1 levels with gadolinium enhancement (Fig. 1A,B, and C). Brain MR imaging findings were normal. The HTLV-1 proviral copy numbers per 1×104 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were 941 in blood and 8566 in CSF. We suspected that the patient likely suffered from acute myelitis resembling HAM rather than ATL with spinal cord invasion because his spinal cord abnormalities resembled LCLs observed in cases of transverse myelitis such as NMO and the absence of abnormal cells in the CSF. He was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone. One month after the treatment, spinal MR imaging showed that the high signal intensity decreased and the swelling of the lesions had attenuated; however, his severe tetraplegia did not improve. He suddenly developed right heart failure 6.5months after admission due to a mass in the right atrium. Although the level of concentration of sIL-2R in serum markedly increased (11,200U/ml), that in CSF did not (82.1IU/ml). He died of right heart failure 1month later. The spinal cord showed no gross abnormality, and no fibrous thickening of the pia matter was observed. The histopathologic findings were myelin pallor of the anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord (Fig. 1D) and obvious loss of myelin sheaths with well-preserved axons (Fig. 1F), where mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltration accompanied by fibrillary gliosis was noted (Fig. 1E). These lymphoid cells were not abnormal lymphocytes. They were positive for CD3 (Fig. 1G) and CD8 (Fig. 1I), but negative for CD4 (Fig. 1H) and CD20. The cervical and mediastinum of lymph nodes and the mass in the right atrium revealed a massive infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells with hyperchromasia and irregularly shaped nuclei (Fig. 1J). The infiltrating cells were positive for CD3 (Fig. 1K), CD4 (Fig. 1L), and CD8 (Fig. 1M), but negative for CD20, as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin sections. "
1364,S1067-2516(09)00198-7,Cutaneous Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma of the Foot: A Rare Case Report," Case Report A 51-year-old Hispanic female presented to our outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of a small mass on her left foot of approximately 2 years' duration. She related that it started with a small insect bite on the side of the left foot, which produced intense itching and she obtained relief using an over-the-counter steroid cream. Several months later, she noticed that the lesion began to take on a light purple coloration with an increase in size, and causing mild to moderate pain with shoe gear. There were no systemic symptoms and the lesion did not cause any limitation of the patient's activity. The patient's past medical history included hypertension and iron deficiency anemia. Approximately 1 year later a dermatologist evaluated her and a punch biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histological features of the specimen included small lymphocytes, follicular colonization, and plasmacytic differentiation consistent with a diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma. The Hematology-Oncology team worked up the patient extensively, including a wide range of blood tests, as well as computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the abdomen, pelvis, and thorax, all of which yielded negative results. The patient was closely observed for another several months by the oncology team and was eventually referred to our service for surgical excision of the lesion with radiation therapy to follow. When she presented to our service, examination of the left foot revealed a raised circular lesion that measured 2.0 × 3.0 cm, located in the medial longitudinal arch at the juncture of the dorsal and plantar skin, and at the area of the talonavicular articulation (approximately 3.0 cm distal to the medial malleolus). The lesion appeared well circumscribed, elevated above the surrounding skin surface, and flesh-toned to light violaceous in color (Figure 1 ). Compression of the lesion revealed a billowy consistency, and the lesion appeared to be confined to the epidermal and dermal layers. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy, and the patient's neurovascular status was intact in the lower extremities. Radiographic examination of the left foot was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left foot revealed a small soft tissue mass confined to the skin along the medial aspect of the midfoot, as well as mild talonavicular osteoarthrosis (Figures 2 and 3) . The patient agreed to surgical intervention after a thorough discussion related to this treatment. Preoperative laboratory studies consisted of a chemistry profile, complete blood count, and urinalysis, all of which were within normal limits with the exception of a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase (123 IU/L). Excision of the lesion was effected using the Mohs technique to ensure complete removal of the tumor (6). Mohs surgery entails excision of a lesion using a dermagraphic map of the area of resection, along with orientation of the lesion in regard to its borders and depth. In essence, this aids the pathologist who processes the specimen using frozen sections via horizontal sectioning and staining techniques while the surgeon awaits the results. If additional areas of tumor are seen, the process is repeated until no further tumor is noted in any of the margins. This method ensures removal of the tumor without excessive excision of adjacent normal tissues. In our case, the specimen was oriented into borders and tagged with different color suture to denote gross lesion, space orientation, and normal tissue. The lesion was also tagged from the dorsal to the plantar quadrant, in order to delineate depth and poles. After confirmation of complete excision of the tumor, it was noted that the mass did not extend into the deep subcutaneous tissues, underlying muscle or bone. The surgical wound was closed primarily, except for a central area that was left open for healing by secondary intention to avoid excessive tension on the surgical wound margins. Ultimately, histopathological examination of the excised specimen, using hematoxalyn and eosin (H&E) staining, demonstrated diffuse lymphoid infiltrates composed of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with slightly irregular nuclear contours and moderate amounts of cytoplasm. In addition, the specimen displayed scattered large cells and plasma cells consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous NHL (Figures 4–6   ). Postoperative care initially included the use of a large, bulky dressing, as well as avoidance of weight bearing on the operated foot for approximately 3 weeks. The wound healed uneventfully and the patient began radiation therapy 6 weeks after the surgical excision, as recommended by the Oncology team. The patient was followed over the course of 3 years after completion of the excision and radiation therapy, with annual blood screening and repeat MRIs of the lumbar spine, as well as CT scans of the thorax and chest. To date, none of the postoperative imaging ever revealed pathological lymphadenopathy or any acute findings suggestive of lymphoma. Clinically, moreover, there was no recurrence of the mass (Figure 7 ). "
1370,S2152-2650(11)70101-X,Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma in a Young Man With Crohn's Disease: Case Report and Literature Review," Case Report A previously healthy 13-year-old boy presented with a 2-month history of fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and 25-pound weight loss. Colonic and terminal ileum biopsies yielded a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. After failing initial treatment with mesalamine and prednisone, he was treated with 6-MP 25 mg alternating with 50 mg every other day. He had a normal baseline thiopurine methyltransferase serum value, drug metabolite levels were maintained in a therapeutic range, and he improved rapidly and remained in excellent health. After 5 years of therapy with 6-MP, at age 18, the patient's repeat colonoscopy was normal, and 6-MP was discontinued. Two weeks later, the patient experienced fevers, fatigue, and dyspnea. He had no gastrointestinal symptoms or weight loss. On examination, he appeared pale and exhausted. Abdominal tenderness and hepatomegaly were absent, but he had splenomegaly that extended 12 cm below the left midcostal margin. Laboratory results included the following: white blood cell count, 6.5 × 109/L with 42% lymphocytes, 16% monocytes, 17% polymorphonuclear cells, 23% bands; hematocrit, 19%; platelets 62 × 109/L; reticulocyte, 5.7% (normal range, 0.5-2.5%); and lactate dehydrogenase 289 U/L (normal range, 145-243 U/L). Creatinine, bilirubin, and hepatic transaminases were all within normal limits. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed only splenomegaly of 26 cm (Figure 1 ). A bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular, with reactive hyperplasia of megakaryocytic, myeloid, and erythroid cell lines. An abnormal monotypic lymphocyte population permeated the bone marrow sinuses (Figure 2 ) and comprised 30%-40% of bone marrow cellularity. These cells were enlarged and displayed high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios with perinuclear clearing. Flow cytometry of the abnormal population of cells showed expression of CD2, CD3, CD7, CD16, CD45, and CD56. The lymphocyte markers CD4, CD8, and CD5 were absent. In situ hybridization studies for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were unremarkable. Gene rearrangement studies showed presence of the ?-? T-cell receptor. These findings were consistent with ?-? HSTCL. 12   The patient was treated with single-agent pentostatin 4 mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 2 cycles without significant improvement. He then received 2 cycles of ifosfamide 5 g/m2 once on day 2, carboplatin administered on day 2 and dosed to an area under the curve of 5, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 daily on days 1-3. He had a transient improvement in systemic symptoms but no improvement in his splenomegaly. He received chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and etoposide, followed by collection of peripheral blood stem cells. The patient then received high-dose cyclophosphamide and busulfan, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT). His course was complicated by culture-negative febrile neutropenia and grade 4 cytopenias. Six weeks after autoSCT, he experienced fevers, night sweats, and rapidly increasing splenomegaly. A detailed infectious disease workup, including a search for bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, proved unremarkable. In the context of progressive lymphoma, the patient received palliative care and died 7 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. "
1371,S0899-7071(16)30106-1,Neurolymphomatosis of the peripheral nervous system: a case report and review of the literature," 2 Case report We present a 65-year-old female patient with past medical history diabetes mellitus type I, remote history of human immunodeficiency virus infection on highly active antiretroviral therapy, hepatitis B, prior myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure and automated implanted defibrillator who presented with symptoms of right gluteal pain and numbness, with weakness of the right lower leg, and difficulty walking. Her surgical history was significant for total hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids. Otherwise, the social and family history was unremarkable. Upon admission, physical examination demonstrated a fully oriented patient to time, person, and place with intact cranial nerves. Bilateral upper extremity strength and sensation were normal. In the lower limb, the following were observed: very limited right lower extremity knee extension with normal strength, right ankle dorsiflexion weakness, and right lateral leg decreased sensation to light touch. Vascular system evaluation was normal with present pulses in the entirety of the length of both legs. The patient's implanted defibrillator was a Medtronic SureScan implantable cardioverter defibrillator system and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible; therefore, a diagnostic workup included MRI of the lumbar spine, which revealed mild thickening of the spinal nerve roots, a nonspecific finding. MRI of the brain was negative and the lumbar puncture performed subsequently was also unremarkable. MRI of the right tibia and fibula demonstrated a 4.9 cm×1.2 cm×1.0 cm lobulated mass anterior to the distal fibular shaft, which was T2 hyperintense and isointense to the skeletal muscle on T1 showing mild enhancement on postcontrast images (Fig. 1a and b). The lesion appeared to be contiguous with the superficial peroneal nerve. At that time, it was thought to represent a peripheral nerve sheath tumor or marked neuritis; other malignant neoplasms such as neurofibroma, neurofibrosarcoma, or rhabdomyosarcoma were also considered but were less likely. The lobulated mass appeared to exert mild mass effect on the extensor digitorum longus muscle belly, however, without definite intramuscular extension. At this time point, it was decided to perform a fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (18-FDG PET/CT) study to determine the avidity and extension of the mass. 18-FDG PET/CT demonstrated increased soft tissue density in the anterior compartment of the lower right thigh with heterogeneously increased tracer uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 4.3 (Fig. 2a and b). Selective peroneal nerve biopsy was sought to provide a more definitive answer to the findings, which demonstrated a diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the peroneal nerve (neurolymphomatosis) and surrounding soft tissue (Fig. 3a). Concomitant flow cytometry demonstrated a B cell lymph proliferative disorder, which was CD19+, CD20+, and B lymphocytes appearing to show lambda light chain restriction (Fig. 3b). The patient was then subjected to chemotherapy composed of rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed transaminitis (alkaline transaminase of 900 U/l) and leukovorin was added to the regimen, with subsequent resolution of condition. Following six cycles of chemotherapy, the patient underwent a restaging 18-FDG PET/CT study that demonstrated resolution of disease. After restaging 18-FDG PET/CT, the patient continued adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation treatment for residual disease eradication. "
1373,S0046-8177(11)00121-3,"Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular characterization of17 Chinese cases"," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Patient selection Twenty-two cases of HSTCL were collected from the Pathology Department of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 1990 to June 2010. Five of them were excluded because of insufficient materials or incomplete clinical data. The remaining 17 cases were included in this study; 4 of them have been described previously in a Chinese journal [26]. Histologic diagnosis of the tumors was based on the World Health Organization classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues [27]. Evaluation of each case was based on the following: (1) examination of histologic features on slides of biopsies; (2) immunophenotype analysis by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, or both, including B- and T-cell differentiation antigens, the NK-associated marker CD56, cytotoxic granules, TCR ?F1 (T-cell receptor Beta F1), and proliferation index; (3) in situ hybridization for the presence of EBV-encoded small-molecular messenger RNA (EBER); and (4) TCR rearrangement. The clinical features of these 17 patients, including age, sex, clinical course, and follow-up data, were compiled. The staging evaluation was based on the Ann Arbor system (1971). All patients had a staging evaluation that consisted of a thorough physical examination, complete blood count, serum assay for lactate dehydrogenase, BM aspiration, and computed tomography (CT) scans of the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.   2.2 Morphology A total of 35 tissue samples were examined: 10 samples from splenectomy and another 5 in combination with liver biopsy samples (wedge resection), 9 image-guided core-needle biopsy liver samples from 7 patients, and 11 BM biopsy samples from 8 patients. BM smears were available in 10 patients. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained sections were used to assess the histologic features.   2.3 Immunohistochemistry The following antibodies were used: CD3? (polyclonal; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), CD4 (1F6; Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), CD8 (C8/144B; DAKO), CD20 (L26; DAKO), CD45RO (UCHL1; DAKO), CD56 (123, C3; Zymed, South San Francisco, CA, USA), granzyme B (GZB01; NeoMarker, Fremont, CA, USA), TIA-1 (2G9; DAKO), ki-67 (MIB-1; DAKO), and TCR ?F1 (TCR1151; Endogen, Thermo Scientific, China). A series of 4-?m paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in a graded series of ethanol. For CD3, CD3?, ?F1, CD8, CD20, CD56, and granzyme B labeling, the slides were treated in citric acid buffer (10 mmol/L, pH 7.4) for 3 minutes. For CD4, TIA-1, and Ki-67 labeling, the slides were treated in EDTA (1 mmol/L, pH 9.0) for 8 minutes. The EnVision method (DAKO) was used for immunohistochemical staining, with diaminobenzidine as substrate; the positive staining was dark brown.   2.4 DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction Genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue samples was extracted by phenol-chloroform procedures. Successful extraction was confirmed by amplification of a 110-base-pair fragment of ?-globin. Both universal TCR? (TVG/TJX) primers and BIOMED-2 (Invitrogen, US) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex tubes (TCR? + TCR?) [28,29] were used for TCR rearrangement analysis. For universal TCR? (TVG/TJX) detection, 1 ?L of each primer at 25 ?mol/L (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) was used in a 25-?L reaction. The PCR mixture (Takara) contained 2.5 ?L of 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 ?L of 25 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 ?L of 2.5 mmol/L deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase, and 1 ?g of template DNA. A 5-?L amount of PCR products was electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel (110 V, 30 minutes). Gels were stained with Goldview (Saibaisheng, China) and visualized with ultraviolet light using Image Acquisition and Analysis Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). BIOMED-2 PCR multiplex tube (TCR? + TCR?) detection was essentially based on the procedure of Van Dongen et al [28].   2.5 In situ hybridization In situ hybridization was carried out with a fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to 2 EBV-encoded small RNAs, EBER-1 and EBER-2 (EBER1/2; DAKO, No. Y520001). Rabbit anti–fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (DAKO) was used to combine with the probe, whereas nitroblue tetrazolium (NBI)/ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) was used as substrate. The dark blue–purple hybridizing signal was located in the cell nucleus.   2.6 Survival and statistical analysis Follow-up data were obtained for 12 (70.58%) of the 17 patients. Overall survival time was estimated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up and was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software for Windows, version 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).  "

She underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, yielding an initial diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma with a differential including NK/T-cell lymphoma vs EATL. Based on this differential, a gluten-free diet was attempted. After failing to respond to dietary changes, she was treated with 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone, resulting in clinical improvement of her abdominal pain. Although follow-up endoscopies in 2003 and 2005 revealed inflammatory abnormalities and focal ulcerations, there appeared to be no recurrence of the lymphoproliferative disorder. In October 2007, the patient returned with vomiting, iron deficiency, and abdominal pain. A positron emission tomography scan demonstrated increased uptake in multiple abdominal lymph nodes, concerning for lymphoma. The result of fine-needle aspiration of an abdominal lymph node was negative, and an abdominal lymph node biopsy showed follicular hyperplasia with no clonality by flow cytometry or T-cell gene rearrangement studies. Her symptoms worsened after surgery, and she developed marked watery diarrhea. She was hospitalized and given intravenous steroids with improvement in her diarrhea and resolution of her abdominal pain. She was subsequently managed with oral 10 mg prednisone daily with continued symptom abatement. Repeat upper and lower endoscopy in March 2009 continued to reveal the atypical CD56-positive T-cell proliferation in the stomach and descending colon. The patient remains today in relatively good health, 8 years after her initial diagnosis. "
1406,S0009-2797(05)00067-0,"Exposure to benzene and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, an epidemiologic overview and an ongoing case-control study in Shanghai"," 2 An Epidemiologic Overview In 1979 Vianna and Polan reported the results of an investigation based on the linkage of deaths from lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma or Hodgkin disease during 1950–1969 in New York State and the 1960 US census [15]. Fourteen selected occupations were assumed to have exposure to benzene or coal tar fractions. For denominator, Vianna and Polan used the 1960 census data to determine the number of workers in these occupations (“populations at risk”). A total of 242,105 New York residents in these 14 occupations were identified from the 1960 census. The largest groups were farmers (80,366) and woodworkers (47,549). Other occupations with exposure included fishermen, brick and stone workers, and barbers. The numerators were lymphoma deaths (total=2654) among New York residents in these occupations between 1950 and 1969. Occupations listed on death certificates were used to identify New York residents in these occupations who died from lymphosarcoma or reticulosarcoma. According to Vianna and Polan [15], an increased risk of lymphosarcoma or reticulosarcoma was found in these occupations, and, in particular, the highest risk was reported among fishermen. The Vianna and Polan investigation has been criticized by Enterline [16], Smith and Lickiss [17], and Wong [18]. The major criticism was that information on occupation derived from the US census and from death certificates was not compatible, and the reported mortality excess might simply be an artifact due to the inadequate study design. Subsequent to the Vianna and Polan record-linkage investigation, several cohort studies addressed the issue of benzene exposure and NHL. Hayes et al. [19] reported a cohort study of 74,828 workers in 12 cities in China, who were exposed to benzene in a wide spectrum of industries with heterogeneous exposures (e.g., food, textile, paper products, agricultural chemicals, pharmaceutical, rubber and plastic, electrical equipment). The comparison group was a cohort of 35,805 Chinese workers who were not exposed to benzene or any other carcinogens. Hayes et al. reported 16 NHL cases among the benzene-exposed workers and three among the non-exposed workers. The risk ratio (RR) was 3.0, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.9–10.5. Analysis by occupation reported the following RRs: “organic, insecticide and benzene production” (RR=7.8), paint and other coatings (RR=1.6), and shoe (RR=1.6). The group “organic, insecticide and benzene production,” which had the highest risk, consisted of several heterogeneous industries/occupations with very different exposures. In particular, insecticide workers are exposed to a variety of chemicals not related to benzene, and studies have reported increased risk of NHL among agricultural chemical workers or farmers throughout the world. Thus, the result might have been confounded by chemicals other than benzene. In the Hayes et al. study, individual benzene exposure estimates were developed based on ambient benzene exposure measurements and production/process information at the subjects’ factories. Analysis by cumulative benzene exposure reported the following RRs: 1.0, 3.3, 1.1, and 3.5 for non-exposed, <40, 40–99, and 100+ppm years, respectively. The lack of a clear positive exposure-response relationship further argues against an association between benzene exposure and NHL. Quite appropriately, Hayes et al. did not conclude that the findings established a causal association between benzene exposure and NHL. Instead, they concluded that “the possible links with NHL are all provocative new observations”. Wong reported the mortality experience of a cohort study of 7676 chemical workers in the US [20,21]. Most of these workers were exposed to benzene in the 1940s and 1950s, with some whose first exposure occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. Based on historical exposure measurements and facility histories, exposure estimates were developed for workers’ jobs in the study. Some of the jobs entailed relatively high benzene levels in the past (in the range of 50–100ppm). In the original study, no analysis specific to NHL was reported because of the NHL classification in the past and the grouping of diseases in vital statistics. A subsequent analysis indicated that there were seven deaths from NHL among workers exposed to benzene, compared to 5.12 expected deaths based on the US general population [22]. The corresponding SMR was 1.37 (95% CI 0.55–2.82). Thus, there was no increased risk of NHL in this large cohort of workers exposed to benzene. In the US there is another often-cited cohort study of workers exposed to benzene, consisting of 1165 white men at two rubber hydrochloride plants in Ohio, where benzene exposures were reported to be very high (up to several hundred ppm) [23]. Individual benzene exposure estimates were developed for the workers in the study. A significant increase of leukemia mortality was reported in the study. In particular, a remarkable risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was found and a positive exposure-response relationship between cumulative exposure to benzene and AML was also reported [24]. In terms of NHL, however, based on the latest update, Rinsky et al. reported 5 NHL deaths, comparable to 5.01 expected (SMR=1.00, 95% CI 0.32–2.33) [25]. Thus, there was no elevated risk of NHL in this cohort of workers who were exposed to extremely high levels of benzene and who were found to have experienced an elevated risk of AML. Petroleum workers are exposed to benzene or benzene-containing petroleum products, such as gasoline, which typically contains 2–3% of benzene by volume. A comprehensive review of airborne concentrations of benzene in the petroleum industry can be found in an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monograph [26]. Studies of petroleum workers, therefore, provide an opportunity for investigating the relationship between benzene and NHL. Wong and Raabe reviewed and summarized the results of 26 cohorts of petroleum workers in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, and Finland [27]. Data from these studies were reviewed individually as well as combined in a pooled analysis (meta-analysis). The combined multi-national cohort consisted of 308,199 petroleum workers (6.6 million person-years), and the observation period covered an interval of 60 years from 1937 to 1996. A total of 506 NHL deaths were observed, compared to 561.68 expected. The SMR was 0.90 and the 95% CI was 0.82–0.98. Stratified analyses were performed by type of facility or industrial process. Stratum-specific SMRs (95% CIs) were 0.96 (0.86–1.07) for US refinery workers, 1.12 (0.90–1.37) for non-US refinery workers, 0.64 (0.50–0.82) for product (gasoline) distribution workers, and 0.68 (0.47–0.95) for crude oil workers. When individual cohorts were stratified by length of observation, no pattern was detected. In general, occupational exposure levels prior to 1950 were much higher than thereafter. However, analysis of workers by hire date (<1950, ?1950) revealed no difference in NHL mortality. Furthermore, none of the individual studies showed significant exposure-response relationship. In summary, results from individual studies as well as from the pooled analysis indicated that petroleum workers were not at an increased risk of NHL as a result of their exposure to benzene or other benzene-containing petroleum products in their work environment.  Table 1  summarizes the findings of NHL from the above cohort studies. Only the study of Chinese workers reported an increased risk (RR=3.0, 95% CI 0.9–10.5). However, there was no clear exposure-response relation when the data were analyzed by cumulative benzene exposure. The potential confounding due to other chemicals (such as insecticides) further weakened the finding. Other cohort studies of workers exposed to benzene or benzene-containing products consistently demonstrated no increased risk of NHL. Further supporting evidence that there is no association between benzene exposure and NHL comes from case-control studies, which have been summarized by Wong [22,27]. In a case-control study consisting of 501 NHL patients in North Carolina, Schumacher and Delzell reported 66 cases exposed to benzene [28]. The risk ratios for benzene exposure were 0.77 (95% CI 0.56–1.07) in whites and 0.94 (95% CI 0.47–1.87) in blacks. Ott et al. [29] conducted a detailed case-control study of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue cancers among 29,139 Union Carbide employees in West Virginia. Based on 52 cases, the NHL risk ratio for exposure to benzene was reported as 1.0. In a case-control study consisting of 303 NHL cases in Boston, the risk ratio for benzene exposure was 1.2 (95% CI 0.5–2.6) [10]. In a case-control study conducted by the US National Cancer Institute, the exposure histories of 622 NHL cases in Iowa and Minnesota were compared to those of 1245 controls [13]. A total of 153 cases were reported to have been exposed to benzene. The risk ratio for benzene exposure was 1.1 (95% CI 0.9–1.4), indicating no increased risk. Case-control studies from other countries also support the results of no association reported in the American studies. In a case-control study consisting of 215 NHL patients in Montreal, 26 cases reported exposure to benzene [30]. The relative risks were 0.7 for any exposure to benzene and 0.8 for substantial exposure to benzene. In another report based on the same data, Siemiatycki et al. [31] reported the following relative risks for a variety of petroleum-derived fuels or solvents: 0.8 for automotive gasoline, 0.4 for aviation gasoline, 0.8 for mineral spirits, 0.4 for kerosene, 0.7 for jet fuel, 1.1 for diesel fuel, and 0.7 for heating oil. In an Italian case-control study of 208 NHL cases, the risk ratio for exposure to benzene and solvents was reported as 1.14, with a 95% CI of 0.57–2.28 [3]. In a case-control study of NHL conducted in the UK, the employment and medical histories of 158 cases were compared to those of their matched controls [6,32]. The risk ratio for benzene exposure was 0.49, with a 95% CI of 0.21–2.00. The risk ratios reported in these case-control studies of NHL and benzene or benzene-containing solvents ranged from 0.49 to 1.2 (Table 2 ). Although exposure classification in some of these case-control studies might lack specificity, these investigations have consistently demonstrated that no association was found between exposure to benzene and NHL. Thus, these case-control studies confirm the results of cohort studies of workers exposed to benzene or benzene-containing petroleum products. "

A triple therapy consisting of cyclosporine A, prednisolone, and azathioprine was prescribed. In December 1997, he developed a small ulcer at the back of the pharynx. Clinical examination, serologic tests for EBV (including Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen [EBNA] and EBV early antigen [EA]) cytomegalovirus (CMV), Listeria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-1) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), and imaging studies showed (1) EBV seroconversion as evidenced by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titer, (2) a small pleural and a hemodynamically irrelevant pericardial effusion, and (3) a tumor with a diameter of 2 cm in the left lateral pharyngeal wall and an enlarged lymph node on the contralateral right cervical side as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Histologic examination of a tumor biopsy specimen yielded a posttransplant-associated NK/T-cell lymphoma with no evidence of bone marrow involvement. Cyclosporine was ommitted from the immunosuppressive therapy; chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and methylprednisolone (CHOP) was started. A CT scan performed after 4 cycles of CHOP showed a complete remission of the PTLPD. As of April 2001, the patient was still alive without evidence of neoplastic disease. "

She had had a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis three months before in another center and was on rifampicin and isoniazid. Her blood tests taken in the previous 20 months showed lymphocytosis varying from 10,000 to 13,700 lymphocytes/mm3. Physical examination revealed cervical and retroauricular lymphadenomegaly. No skin lesions were observed. Blood examination showed leukocytosis with mild lymphocytosis (5940lymphocytes/mm3). The blood levels of calcium, urea, and albumin were within the normal limits but the LDH was slightly elevated. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed an expression of CD3, CD4, CD5, TCR?? and CD2 with co-expression of CD25. The lymphoid cells were negative for CD7, CD8, TCR??, and for NK cell and B-cell markers. Serology for HIV was negative. Cervical and thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed cervical and thoracic enlarged lymph nodes and infiltration in the left lung; abdominal CT was normal. A lymph node biopsy was performed and a diagnosis of Hodgkin-like ATLL was given, clinically corresponding to a favorable chronic ATLL. It was decided that the treatment for ATLL should begin after Tb control, considering the high toxicity of the combined therapy and the fact that favorable chronic ATLL constitutes an indolent form of ATLL. 1   ATLL treatment was initiated six months after admission with zidovudine and interferon-? but due to important side-effects the drugs were discontinued and the patient began to be treated with six cycles of standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) with partial response. After 14 months of Tb treatment, she was considered cured with no acid-alcohol resistant bacilli in sputum smears and negative culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The lymphocytosis reappeared after the end of chemotherapy and persisted until September 2013 varying from 4600 to 8000 lymphocytes/mm3. At this time, CT revealed enlarged cervical, thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes. Elevation of LDH, 2.5 times the upper normal limit, bilateral pleural effusion, slight peritoneal effusion and paresthesia and unilateral palpebral ptosis were also observed. She received two more salvage regimen of chemotherapy with partial response and died at home four months later. Pathologic findings – The lymph node exhibited diffuse infiltration of medium-sized atypical lymphocytes. Scattered in this background, HRS-like cells were seen, isolated or in small clusters (Fig. 1A). The medium-sized lymphocytes expressed CD3, CD4, CD5, CD25 (Fig. 1B), CD45RO (UCHL-1) and were CD8 negative. A marked reduction of CD7 expression was observed. The HRS-like cells were positive for CD30 (Fig. 1C), CS1-4 (Fig. 1D), CD79a, and focally for Bcl6 and CD20. The proliferative index as determined by Ki-67 immunostaining was 50%, especially in the giant cells. Both cell types were negative for CD10, CD15, CD21, CD23, and PD1. "

A case report and review of literature"," 2 Case report A 64-year-old male came in for a regular follow-up in oncology clinic. About 22 months ago, he presented with chest pressure. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a 15cm×9cm anterior mediastinal mass. Biopsy of the mass showed lymphoma and the tumor cells were CD20, CD79a positive and CD3, CD10, CD15 and CD30 negative. He was diagnosed with stage IA DLBCL. The international prognostic index (IPI) score was 1. He was treated with eight cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP). After treatment, the size of the mediastinal mass decreased to 1.7cm, and positron-emission tomography (PET) scan was negative for residual disease. About 9 months ago, he was found to have a new PET positive 2.2cm lung nodule. There was no active disease in other sites. He underwent a wedge resection of the lung nodule and the pathology showed recurrent DLBCL. He was offered treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation but he refused this option. He received two cycles of chemotherapy with rituximab, ifosphamide, carboplatin and etoposide (R-ICE). He was followed in clinic and his last PET scan done at 3 months ago was negative for disease. At this time, he had no symptoms or palpable lymph nodes. His PET scan was unremarkable except for showing a mass lesion with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 12 in the distal SVC (Fig. 1 a). CT scan did not show any corresponding anatomic abnormalities. Three months later, the SUV of the lesion was 23 (Fig. 1b). CT scan this time found a 2.7cm intraluminal mass in the SVC just above the cavoatrial junction that occluded 80% of the lumen (Fig. 1c). The mass had subtle central gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain MRI and bone marrow biopsy were negative for involvement with lymphoma. Venogram confirmed the presence of a mass in the SVC. Interventional radiology was consulted. Using forceps catheter placed through the jugular vein into the SVC, multiple biopsies of the mass were obtained. The pathology was consistent with recurrent DLBCL. He was treated with three cycles of rituximab, dexamethasone, cisplatin and cytarabine (R-DHAP). MRI showed that the intraluminal mass had completely resolved after the first cycle of treatment. PET scan was negative for residual disease. He has been disease free for 7 months since completion of last cycle of treatment. "
1421,S0344-0338(11)00217-2,"A case of lymphomatoid gastropathy: An indolent CD56-positive atypical gastric lymphoid proliferation, mimicking aggressive NK/T cell lymphomas"," Discussion CD56-positive lymphomas are characterized by their well known aggressive clinical course that necessitates vigorous treatment. Last year evidenced the evolution of a new pathological entity of self-limited pseudomalignant CD56-positive lymphoproliferative lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. To our knowledge, to date, 10 cases have been reported in the stomach under the term (lymphomatoid gastropathy) [9]. Other authors used the term (NK-cell enteropathy) to describe similar lesions diffusely distributed through the gastrointestinal tract and not limited to the stomach. Eight cases have been reported under this term until now [6]. On the histological basis, lymphomatoid gastropathy may show small foci of necrosis, but lacks the characteristic angiocentric and angiodestructive lesions seen in ENTCL. Furthermore, the large eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules which were curiously detected in lymphomatid gastropathy cases were not seen in ENTCL [9]. The immunohistochemical profile of lymphomatoid gastropathy is characteristically unique and can easily differentiate such indolent cases from the other aggressive CD56-positive lymphomas. In lymphomatoid gastropathy, cytoplasmic CD3 is positive while surface CD3 is negative. EBV is always negative and no evidence of TCR gene rearrangement. CD7 is characteristically positive. CD4 and CD8 are negative [9]. Differentiation from CD56-positive enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma with loss of T-cell markers on the histological or immunohistochemical basis only could be difficult. However, TCR gene rearrangement in such conditions could be extremely beneficial. Takeuchi reported that CD56 was strongly positive, among which CD16 was negative in five cases of lymphomatoid gastropathy examined. However, in our case, the atypical cells were strongly positive for CD56 and positive for CD16. Poli et al. reported that CD56brightCD16? and CD56brightCD16dim were subpopulations of NK cells for flow cytometric analysis [7]. Freud and Caligiuri indicated that NK cells had functional maturation and transitioning from CD56brightCD16? to CD56dimCD16+ for flow cytometric analysis [5]. Although the expression level measured by flow cytometry cannot be directly compared with that measured by immunohistochemistry, these results suggest that NK cells change the intensities of CD56 and CD16 expressions according to the developmental stages, and can be positive for both CD56 and CD16. Further case collection needs to be warranted to clarify the significance of CD16 expression in atypical cells of lymphomatoid gastropathy. Ninety percent of the reported cases were positive for H. pylori [9]. This high percentage could be attributed to the fact that all the reported cases were from Japan, where the percentage of H. pylori infection may reach 80% among the normal population [10]. However, the relation between H. pylori and lymphomatoid gastropathy needs to be elucidated in further studies. The clinical course in all the reported cases was indolent and ranged between spontaneous regression, mere persistence, and multiple relapses of the lesion. None of the reported cases showed progression or death of the disease. In concordance with this non-lethal course, our patient showed spontaneous regression with recurrence of the lesion in another site of the stomach 22 months later followed again with spontaneous regression. The only line of treatment in such condition is to wait and see. Misdiagnosis of such cases usually results in subsequent administration of gastrectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or even bone marrow transplantation. In the series reported by Takeuchi et al., two patients were treated by gastrectomy [9]. In the series reported by Mansoor et al., three patients received unnecessary chemotherapy with or without bone marrow transplantation [6]. In conclusion, lymphomatoid gastropathy is a new evolving entity of CD56-positive pseudomalignant lymphoid proliferations seen in the stomach. Although most lesions disappeared spontaneously, some lesions rarely relapsed. These patients should be diagnosed carefully to distinguish it from the aggressive lymphoma. "

Most of the affected juvenile and adult chickens of the backyard flock had exhibited anorexia, depression, ruffled feathers, whitish diarrhea, and cachexia; 46 chickens (~46%) died. No neurological sings were observed in the affected chickens and none had received therapeutic treatment. When necropsied, moderate pectoral atrophy was noted in chickens 1 and 2, whereas chicken 3 had numerous well-demarcated, white, rice-grain sized and shaped foci distributed both on the surface and within the pectoral muscle (  Figs. 1 and 2). The proventriculus was severely transmurally and circumferentially thickened, obliterating the lumen in all the 3 chickens. Moderate roundworm intestinal parasitism due to Ascaridia spp. was identified in chickens 1 and 3. Samples of the brain, cervical vagus and sciatic peripheral nerves, lungs, heart, pectoral muscle, liver, spleen, kidneys, proventriculus, ventriculus, gonads, pancreas, and small and large intestine from all 3 chickens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, pH 7.2, for 48 hours. All tissues were processed by standard histological techniques for the production of 4-µm thick hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. Fresh samples of the liver and spleen of the 3 birds were inoculated onto MacConkey agar (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, UK) and sheep blood agar (Oxoid Ltd.) plates and incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 hours. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of all birds by the use of a DNA commercial extraction kit (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, QIAGEN, Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer?s instructions. Amplification and detection were carried out with an IQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA USA) by using SYBR Green (SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, CA USA) chemistry to detect the meq gene of the virus as described by Abdul-Careem et al. 10  Intestinal contents of the 3 chickens were pooled and analyzed by a fecal floatation test.

1471,S1368-8375(99)00034-2,Spontaneous regression of an anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the oral cavity: first reported case and review of the literature," 2 Discussion This interesting case would appear to be the first in the world literature reporting the spontaneous regression of an ALCL in the oral cavity. Disease relapse with rapidly progressive cervical lymphadenopathy occurred after a disease-free interval of 12 months from primary remission but without any recurrence at the primary site in the oral cavity. Malignant oral lymphomas are rare, accounting for 2–5% of all oral malignancies [1,2], although they are the third most common malignancy in the oral cavity. Malignant lymphomas may be classified into two broad groups: Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Hodgkin's disease accounts for around 30% of malignant lymphomas and characteristically involves a younger age group with the usual presentation being painless enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. The histological diagnosis is dependent on the identification of the Reed-Sternberg cell or of one of its variants. The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are further subdivided according to the precursor cell, cytological features and histological pattern; thus they may be of T-cell or B-cell lineage, poorly or well differentiated and diffuse or follicular. The lymphocytes have varying degrees of differentiation from mature small cells to large immunoblasts which may resemble histiocytes. The majority of head and neck lymphomas arise in lymphoid tissue, especially the cervical group of nodes (the so-called NODAL lymphoma) and Waldeyer's ring. Almost all types of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have been described. The less common primary EXTRA-NODAL lymphomas account for between 25 and 40% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [1], although almost 75% of lymphomas in HIV positive patients are extra-nodal in presentation [3]. Systemically, extra-nodal lymphomas can arise from organs such as the spleen, from non-lymphoid organs which contain a substantial amount of native lymphoid tissue such as the gastro-intestinal tract and in tissues normally devoid of lymphoid tissue such as the brain. Oral extra-nodal lymphomas account for 1.4% of the total numbers of lymphomas and the commonest sites for these are vestibule and gingivae, mandible, palatal soft tissue and maxilla and tongue, respectively [4–6]. Up to 97% of these oral extra-nodal lymphomas may be of B-cell lineage [7]. Other head and neck sites commonly affected are the salivary glands. Tumours arising in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) often have a much better prognosis than other head and neck lymphomas with regressions being reported spontaneously or after treatment directed toward eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection [8–10]. With regard to the salivary glands, malignant transformation may occur in existing lymphoid tissue or may arise in the proliferative states of the lymphoepithelial lesion or in Sjogren's syndrome. Interestingly, a recent study has suggested that occupation may be important in the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Farmers, as in this case, have a slightly increased risk; contact with an infectious agent being the postulated risk factor [11]. This is interesting in that this patient had a history of cutaneous orf. Furthermore, he experienced a tick bite some 2 weeks before his most dramatic relapse. "
1481,S0022-3468(11)00442-8,Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with chest wall involvement: a case series," 1 Case reports  1.1 Case 1 A 10-year-old boy presented to an emergency department after noticing a “softball-sized” mass protruding from his left chest wall after an accidental trauma to his left chest. A radiograph and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest were obtained. The CT scan revealed a large, lobulated soft tissue mass (7.2 × 7.4 cm) in the prevascular space encasing the brachiocephalic vein (Fig. 1 ). The patient then presented to our institution where a biopsy of this mass was performed, which showed nodular sclerosing HL. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan was obtained, which revealed a hypermetabolic anterior mediastinal mass and node, hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (LAD) in the bilateral supraclavicular regions, paratracheal LAD, and a hypermetabolic parasternal soft tissue mass. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIA bulky nodular sclerosing HL. He underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy with ABVE-PC (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide). The patient was deemed to be a slow responder to this regimen and was started on chemotherapy with DECA (dexamethasone, etoposide, and cytarabine). He also received a 21-Gy dose of radiation (in 14 fractions) to the involved fields. The patient is currently disease-free, 15 months after completion of treatment.   1.2 Case 2 A 17-year-old adolescent boy presented to an outside hospital after noticing a slightly painful “lump” on his sternum. A chest radiograph was obtained, which showed a chest wall deformity. The patient was told that this was a developmental abnormality; however, he continued to experience pain. A month later, the patient underwent a CT scan of the chest, which showed a mild prominence of the sternum. He was told that this was not abnormal. Five months later, the patient noticed that the sternal mass had grown. In addition, by then, he had developed a cough, wheezing, and low-grade fevers. A diagnostic workup was done including a CT scan, which revealed a mass on the anterior manubrium (5.0 × 2.6 cm) with bone invasion (Fig. 2 ), as well as mediastinal LAD, LAD anterior to the diaphragm, an enlarged right supraclavicular lymph node, and bilateral axillary lymph nodes. The patient then presented to our institution where a biopsy of the right axillary lymph node was performed, which revealed nodular sclerosing HL. A bone marrow biopsy was performed; the results were normal. A PET scan revealed multiple foci of lymphomatous tissue above and below the diaphragm. The patient was diagnosed with stage IVA disease. He was started on chemotherapy with BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone)–ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and received a 21-Gy dose of radiation (in 14 fractions) to all involved fields. The patient is currently disease-free, 68 months after completion of therapy.   1.3 Case 3 A 16-year-old adolescent boy presented to an emergency department with an asthma exacerbation. A chest radiograph was obtained, which showed a mediastinal mass. A CT scan of the chest was also obtained, which revealed not only a mediastinal mass but also a right chest wall mass at the level of the second rib. A CT scan of the abdomen showed adenopathy anterior to the liver, and a gallium scan showed uptake in both hilar regions. A biopsy of a right axillary lymph node was performed, which showed nodular sclerosing HL. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIA disease and was started on Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 5942 therapy (as described elsewhere [4]). However, after several courses of chemotherapy, the disease persisted. The patient then underwent a resection of the chest wall mass and mediastinal mass; the pathology report revealed fibrotic tissue. Ten months after completion of chemotherapy, the patient underwent a biopsy of a mediastinal mass, which showed recurrent HL. He then presented to our institution and was started on ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) therapy. He also underwent a peripheral stem cell transplant. Despite therapy, the disease continued to progress; and the patient eventually died of the disease 6 years and 6 months after initial diagnosis.  "
1483,S1015-9584(11)00008-X,Primary colorectal lymphoma: Case series and literature review," 2 Patients and methods A retrospective study was performed of all patients who presented with primary colorectal lymphoma from January 1998 to December 2008. Clinical details derived from patients’ medical records, including patient characteristics and clinical data, type of treatment, pathologic findings, recurrence rate, mortality, and morbidity, were recorded and analyzed. All of the patients were diagnosed with primary colorectal lymphoma preoperatively. Tissue diagnosis was obtained by colonoscopy, and all patients underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan to determine the stage of disease and exclude metastases. Patients who had undergone emergency surgery were also excluded. Our patients fit Dawson’s criteria 6  for the diagnosis of primary colorectal lymphoma: histopathologic confirmation of a lymphoproliferative neoplasm confined to the colon and/or rectum with: (1) absence of palpable lymphadenopathy; (2) absence of mediastinal node enlargement; (3) normal white cell count and differential in the evaluation of peripheral blood; (4) a lesion confined mainly to the bowel with only local lymphadenopathy seen at laparotomy; and (5) absence of liver or spleen involvement at laparotomy. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data analysis. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used in comparing the categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used in comparing the continuous variables in median values. "
1491,S1934-1482(15)00542-0,Poster 194 Peripheral Neuropathy in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma: Neurolymphomatosis or Guillain-Barre Syndrome. A Case Report," Case Description A 25-year-old man was admitted with weakness and numbness in all extremities for 3 days. With the absence of reflexes in knees/ankles and elevated protein in CSF, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) was suspected. He achieved somewhat improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin. During subsequent acute inpatient rehabilitation, he developed non-productive cough and worsening leukocytosis. Extensive workup revealed a large mediastinal mass and biopsy confirmed a classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL). Patient continued to exhibit proximal weakness and newly onset neuropathic pain in lower extremities. MRI showed abnormal enhancement of cauda equine and exiting lumbar roots suggesting a focal inflammatory process. EMG was consistent with diffuse polyradiculopathy likely secondary to lymphomatous infiltration. Clinical picture suggested more of neurolymphomatosis. "
1495,S1344-6223(11)00020-4,A fatal case of hemoperitoneum after ultrasound-guided liver biopsy in a patient with intravascular large B-cell lymphoma," 2 Case report  2.1 Case history A 79 year-old diabetic male with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia, was referred to the hematology unit of a hospital because of anemia with thrombocytopenia. Computed tomography showed hepatosplenomegaly. Suspected lymphatic malignancy was investigated by needle aspiration of the inguinal lymph nodes, with inconclusive results. Subsequent abdominal ultrasonography revealed mass lesions in the hepatic parenchyma and the patient’s general condition gradually worsened, with complaints of dizziness and chest discomfort, so liver biopsy under hospitalization was scheduled. Because the platelet count was less than 60,000/?l, platelet concentrate (?2×1011/200ml) was infused prior to the biopsy, which was performed in the patient room under ultrasound monitoring. He remained stable for 3h after completion of the procedure, despite persistent minor bleeding from the puncture site. However, 6h after the biopsy, systolic blood pressure had fallen to 50mmHg. Emergency ultrasonography followed by selective abdominal angiography disclosed perihepatic hematoma but failed to identify the origin. Red cell (1200ml) concentrates were administered, to no avail, and 5h later he was pronounced dead in the intensive care unit.   2.2 Autopsy findings A forensic autopsy was performed at 36h postmortem. The decedent was 158.0cm, 64.0kg, oriental male appearing consistent with the stated age. The face was pale and faint rubor mortis appeared on the back. Moderate pitting edema was noted in the lower extremities, and the scrota were swollen. Two needle marks, each 4mm in length, were found in the right hypochondriac region (Fig. 1 a) and their wound tracks reached the hepatic parenchyma. Aside from the measured 1100g of coagulated blood on and around the frontal and lateral surfaces of the liver, the peritoneal cavity contained 3300ml of bloody fluid (Fig. 1b). The non-cirrhotic 2230g liver was congested and had two punctures in the lateral surface of the right lobe, 3mm and 2mm in length and each 3cm in depth, which ended at a whitish region of 1cm in diameter, in the dark maroon parenchyma (Fig. 2 ). Serial sectioning of the liver along the wound track failed to disclose any macroscopic vascular injuries, although the intra-hepatic arteries were atherosclerotic with calcification. The enlarged 620g spleen was congested, and multiple whitish-yellow firm nodules, up to 1cm in diameter were scattered throughout the cut surfaces. The right iliac lymph nodes were markedly swollen up to 3.5×2×1.5cm, although changes were insignificant in other regional lymph nodes. The left and right thoracic cavities each contained 100ml of dark red fluid. The 660g left lung and 785g right lung had smooth pleural surfaces with excessive anthracotic pigmentation. The pulmonary cut surfaces were markedly edematous and the bronchi contained a moderate amount of dark red and yellowish fluid. The globular 540g heart had thickened myocardium and the left ventricular cavity was narrowed. A whitish patch, 0.5cm in diameter, was noted in the anterior wall of the myocardium just above the apex. The right dominant coronary arterial system had mild atherosclerosis and the lumens were dilated. The 185g left kidney and 110g right kidney had fine granular cortical surfaces and multiple cysts up to 1.5cm in size. The adrenal glands were grossly unremarkable externally and on sectioning. Histology showed proliferation of large atypical lymphoid cells with a moderate to scant amount of cytoplasm, accumulating exclusively within vascular and sinusoidal structures of the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lungs, adrenal grands and skeletal muscles (Fig. 3 ). The tumor cells had large, somewhat irregular-shaped nuclei with distinct nucleoli. Prominent hemophagocytosis was also noted in the reticuloendothelial systems. Immunohistochemical staining revealed positivity for the B-cell markers CD20 and CD5, with the absence of staining for T-cell marker CD3 (Fig. 4 ), confirming the diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL). The liver sinusoids appeared markedly dilated and filled with CD68 positive macrophages and erythrocytes as major components, with some atypical lymphocytes and eosinophilic debris (Figs. 4d and 5 ). The hepatocytes were atrophic and a radial arrangement surrounding the terminal venules was not discernible (Fig. 5). Besides infiltration of large neoplastic lymphoid cells into the red pulp, the congested spleen showed massive infarction and fibrotic changes (Fig. 3c and d). Distribution of the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow was within normal limit and malignant cells were hardly detected, whereas hemophagocytosis was widely seen (Figs. 3f and 4e). There was a loss of the parallel alignment of myocardial cells, namely myocardial disarray, and increased interstitial fibrosis with occasional collection of lymphocytes with features consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Collection of the lymphoma cells was not observed. Intravascular proliferation of the lymphoma cells in the liver should have caused obstruction and subsequent dilatation of the sinusoids. Massive bleeding would be due to puncture through tumor-accumulated and/or congested sinusoids with coagulation disorders as a contributory factor.  "

She showed no abnormalities during the immediate postoperative period, receiving immunosuppressive treatment with CsA, azathioprine (AZA), and prednisone. An acute rejection episode which occurred in 1994 was controlled with pulse therapy (methylprednisolone, 250 mg × 3). In January 2001, she presented with a vaginal papilloma virus infection treated by a reduced AZA dose (from 100 to 75 mg). The patient underwent upper digestive endoscopy on June 7, 2006 due to dyspeptic symptoms. A histological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of mixed MALT gastric lymphoma (with low- and high-grade components) was associated with the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection (Figs 1, 2).  Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection was initiated on June 13, 2006 using omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 14 days. Modification of the immunosuppression substituted SRL at 4 mg/d dose for CsA and AZA of on June 20, 2006. At that time, the creatinine level was 2.1 mg/dL; IgM and IgG Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serologies were positive. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the skull, abdomen, and thorax were normal. Upper digestive endoscopy performed on July 12, 2006 showed only active chronic gastritis with atrophy and intestinal metaplasia; H. pylori was still present. No neoplasia was observed (Fig 3). Ecoendoscopy showed only localized thickness of the gastric wall, involving predominately the mucosal and submucosal layers, in addition to small, unspecific perigastric lymph nodules. New endoscopies were performed on August 21, 2006 and January 8, 2007, confirming the absence of neoplasia and H. pylori. The patient currently has no complaints, displaying a creatinine value of 1.8 mg/dL and a hemoglobin of 9.4 mg/dL as the result of the use of SRL and ibersatan. "

A Case Report and Review of the Literature," Clinical Presentation A 69-year-old male was referred for evaluation of dysphagia and oropharyngeal pain of 20 days duration. Medical history was significant for MCL of the paranasal sinuses diagnosed 8 years ago. Following initial chemoradiotherapy, the disease remained under remission for 6 years. Subsequent relapses affecting the parotid, cervical lymph nodes and upper right arm were treated with partial disease remission. Clinical evaluation revealed a depressed ulcerated area of 3 cm diameter, with elevated erythematous margins, located on the left soft palate, extending to the uvula and left glossopalatine arch. Computed tomography showed a mass in the left lateral oropharyngeal wall extending into the soft palate. "

Her past medical and family history was unremarkable. Gynecological examination revealed a diffused enlargement of the cervix without ulcer. Papanicolaou (PAP) smear was normal. CT of pelvis was 9cm×8cm in size mass in the cervix which did not extend through pelvis. The cervix biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed that stroma infiltrated by large cell with scant clear cytoplasm convoluted large nuclei, dispersed chromatin and peripheral nucleoli. The immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD20 and LCA and negative for CD3, HMWCK, LMWCK, vimentin, consequently the diagnosis of DLBCL of the cervix was confirmed. At the systemic evaluation of patient, biochemical tests including LDH and complete blood counts were normal. PET–CT was performed for full staging and any malign uptake except for primary cervix mass (SUVmax 11.2) was detected (Fig. 1A). Bone marrow biopsy was also negative for lymphoma. The patient was staged as IEB according to Ann Arbor staging system. ECOG performance status of patient was 1 and she was in low group with respect to international prognostic index (IPI). After she was treated with six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy, PET–CT was repeated and complete response was achieved (Fig. 1B). After that she was treated with external RT to the whole pelvis. A total dose of 3600 Gy in 18 fractions was applied. She well tolerated the therapy without any toxicity. During 10 months of the follow-up, she was well and in the remission."
1506,S0278-2391(09)00588-6,Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma: Case Report and Literature Review,"ALCL, a rare disease, accounts for fewer than 5% of all cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 1  ALCL has a unique characteristic of cohesive proliferation of large pleomorphic cells that express CD30 (Ki-1) and was first described as a clinical entity in 1985. 2  It was originally designated as Ki-1+ ALCL; however, the Ki-1 has since been recognized as a new lymphocyte activation marker and designated CD30. The peak incidence occurs in childhood, and it accounts for approximately 40% of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases in pediatric populations. 3  The epidemiology suggests a male predominance, particularly in cases containing anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Falini et al 4  documented a male/female ratio of 6.5:1 in patients younger than 30 years of age. The risk factors are not clear; however, some reports have suggested Epstein-Barr virus as being important in its pathogenesis, particularly in those cases occurring in Asia and in immunocompromised hosts. 5  "
1518,S0021-9975(10)00369-5,Histopathological and Immunohistochemical Evaluation of 53 Cases of Feline Lymphoplasmacytic Enteritis and Low-Grade Alimentary Lymphoma," Materials and Methods  Samples Cases were identified retrospectively by searching the medical records of the Valentine Charlton Cat Centre (VCCC), the Veterinary Pathology Diagnostic Services (VPDS) and the North Shore Veterinary Specialist Centre for the period January 2002–June 2005. Cases were included if LGAL or LPE had been diagnosed on histopathological evaluation of full-thickness biopsy tissue obtained at the time of an exploratory laparotomy. Prospective cases of LGAL and LPE were actively recruited between July 2005 and March 2008. Cases were included when clinical signs of chronic enteropathy persisted for >4 weeks, when secondary causes of gastrointestinal disease had been excluded and if a diagnosis of LGAL or LPE was made.   Tissue Preparation Sections stained by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) were reviewed and further sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) with primary cross-reactive antisera specific for CD3 (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), CD79a (DakoCytomation), MHC class II (DakoCytomation) and CD45R (Serotec, Oxford, UK) as described previously (Gabor et al., 1999; Kipar et al., 2001; Waly et al., 2001). Negative controls were prepared by substitution of the primary antibody with an isotype-matched antibody, and with buffer only. A negative tissue control (feline kidney) was incubated with anti-MHC II and anti-CD45R. For all primary antibodies, normal feline lymph node was used as the positive tissue control.   Histological and Immunohistochemical Review All cases were reviewed by two pathologists (M. K., A. C.) without knowledge of the clinical history or previous histopathological diagnosis and a consensus diagnosis was reached. Where a consensus could not be reached, a third pathologist (M. D.) reviewed the case, similarly without knowledge of history or previous diagnosis. Cases of lymphoma were graded and classified according to the National Cancer Institute Working Formulation (NCIWF) (Anon, 1982) as previously applied to the cat (Gabor et al., 1999; Valli et al., 2000; Pohlman et al., 2009). Low histopathological grade was assigned based on the average number of mitotic figures seen per 10 high-power (×40 microscope objective) fields being less than five. Cases of lymphoma were further classified according to cell size and nuclear shape as diffuse lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse cleaved cell lymphoma or diffuse small mixed cell lymphoma (both non-cleaved and cleaved nuclei present) (Carter et al., 1986). For lymphoma cases, the phenotype of tumours and classification according to the Revised European American Lymphoma/ World Health Organization (REAL/WHO) classification (Harris et al., 1994; Jakic-Razumovic and Aurer, 2002; Day et al., 2004) was determined. Phenotype was assigned when >50% of the neoplastic cells within a section exhibited positive labelling for B- (CD79a, CD45R) or T-cell (CD3) markers (Cesari et al., 2009). In cases of LPE, the proportion of cells positive for B- and T-cell markers was recorded. MHC class II expression by intestinal enterocytes was recorded as being present or absent. Categorization of microscopical changes was adapted from the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) guidelines for diagnosis of gastrointestinal inflammation (Day et al., 2008). Modifications were made to apply these guidelines for use on full-thickness biopsy samples rather than endoscopically-obtained biopsy samples. In all cases (LPE and LGAL), location of the cellular infiltrate (i.e. epithelium, lamina propria, submucosa, muscularis propria or serosa), presence of epitheliotropism (defined as five or more intraepithelial lymphocytes [IELs] in direct apposition), severity of the infiltrate (i.e. mild, moderate or marked), effect of infiltrate on surrounding tissue architecture (i.e. crypt and villus morphology, presence or absence of mucosal oedema and fibrosis) and proportions of other inflammatory cells (i.e. eosinophils, neutrophils or plasma cells) were noted. Severity of infiltrate in the lamina propria was characterized as normal (no infiltrate), mild (partial or patchy infiltration with no increase in the total cell number, but an increase in the proportion of inflammatory cells), moderate (increased numbers of cells in the majority of the lamina propria) or marked (entire lamina propria infiltrated). Villus stunting was classified as mild (reduced length ± slight increase in width with changes being non-uniform within the section provided); moderate (reduced length with most villi of increased width±fusion of villi) or marked (reduced length of villi with fusion and increased width of villi). Severity of crypt changes (i.e. dilated, distorted or containing crypt abscesses) was defined as normal, mild (<10% crypts affected), moderate (10–25% crypts affected) or marked (>25% crypts affected). Fibrosis of the lamina propria, oedema of the lamina propria and presence of lacteal dilation were defined as being present or absent. The presence of inflammatory cells other than lymphocytes within the infiltrate was noted and an approximate proportion of the infiltrating cell population estimated as being <2%, 2–5% or >5% by examination of a representative section of the sample. For LPE, cases were assigned as being of mild, moderate or marked severity based on subjective assessment of the intensity of the infiltrate and severity of villus and crypt changes. Where >1 region of intestine was available, variation in severity of the neoplastic or inflammatory infiltrate between regions was noted. Each anatomical region of intestine was reviewed separately in order that concurrent LPE and LGAL could be identified. Cases in which both LGAL and LPE were diagnosed were included in the category of neoplasia for statistical purposes.   Statistical Analysis Data were initially analysed using contingency tables and frequencies were calculated. Statistical analyses for comparison of LGAL and LPE were performed using commercially available software (SAS 9.1, SAS Institute Inc., USA) and P <0.05 was considered significant. For dichotomous variables (i.e. epitheliotropism, epithelial expression of MHC class II, presence of fibrosis, presence of oedema, presence of lacteal dilation and proportion of neutrophils present), binary logistic regression analyses were performed. For ordinal variables (i.e. severity of infiltrate, proportion of infiltrate present as eosinophils, proportion of infiltrate present as plasma cells, severity of crypt dilation and severity of villus changes), ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed. Logistic regression analyses for ordinal variables were performed using diagnosis as both an explanatory variable and as an outcome. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyse layers of intestine affected. For the purposes of statistical analysis, and where biologically appropriate, if the number of cases within a specific category was less than five, that category was merged with the adjacent higher category. When more than one anatomical region of intestine was affected, the features of the most severely affected region were included in the analyses. Statistical analyses were performed to detect differences between all cases of LPE and LGAL.  "
1531,S0019-4832(16)00007-9,CD20 negative B-cell lymphoma presenting as constrictive pericarditis: Rare etiology of acute heart failure," 2 Case report A 17-year-old girl presented with gradual onset breathlessness, initially on exertion, NYHA class II since 2 weeks which progressed to NYHA class IV. She had an episode of febrile illness and chest X-ray showed right plural effusion, 6 months ago. Pleural fluid analysis was suggestive of tuberculous etiology; hence, anti-tuberculous treatment was started. In the emergency room, she was tachypneic at rest and room air saturation was 85%. Clinically, there was sinus tachycardia with heart rate of 124min?1. On auscultation, there was no murmur, but decreased breath sounds bilaterally in both lower one third of the chest. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusion. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with low voltage complexes (Fig. 1 ). The differential diagnosis of disseminated multi-drug–resistant tuberculosis, high-grade lymphoma and collagen vascular disease was made. Echocardiography was suggestive of effusive constrictive pericarditis such as >50% variations of Doppler velocities, thickened pericardium, dilated inferior vena cava, noncollapsing with respiration (Figs. 2A–D and 3A–D  ). Also there was evidence of minimal ascites and bilateral mild pleural effusion on sonographic examination of abdomen and chest. Laboratory investigations revealed mild anemia [Hb – 8.9g%], a slight increase in TLC with lymphocyte predominance with normal ESR initially. Peripheral smear showed normocytic normochromic red blood cells, absolute lymphocytic leukocytosis, and adequate platelets. Liver function test showed mild elevation of bilirubin, liver enzymes, and mild hypoalbuminaemia. Serological markers (such as antinuclear antibody and RA factor) of collagen vascular diseases were negative. Serum LDH level was 652U/L that is usually elevated in lymphomas. Pleural effusion fluid analysis showed predominance of lymphocytes with no evidence of any organism. ADA level was 72mg/dl. Pleural fluid cytology showed predominately lymphocytes, few neutrophils, and reactive mesothelial cells. There were no malignant cells. Her viral screening including HIV-1 and HIV-2 was nonreactive. Laboratory investigations were not conclusive of any possible etiology of the cause of constriction. Hence, a possible diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis was made. Pleural fluid was negative for any bacterial growth after 48h of incubation. Contrast-enhanced CT scans of chest revealed soft tissue density mass encasing cardiac chambers with significant bilateral pleural effusion with passive collapse of both lungs. Meanwhile, there was no response to conservative anti-failure treatment hence, the case was discussed with cardiothoracic surgeon and planned for surgical pericardiectomy. She underwent total pericardiectomy through midline thoracotomy, pericardium was grossly thickened, adherent to sternum and myocardium (Fig. 4A–D). There were few areas of fibrosis and calcifications. Post operatively, the patient improved significantly with reduction of her symptoms. Histopathological examination of pericardial biopsy report showed fibro-adipose tissue of pericardium and adjacent striated muscles infiltrated with monomorphic lymphocytes with high mitotic activity. These infiltrating cells were positive for CD45 [LCA], negative for CD3, CD20, and CD138, weak-to-moderate positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), high MIB-1 index [70–80%]. Chemotherapy in consultation with medical oncologist was started in the form of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP regime). After initial improvement, her symptoms worsened further 1 week later in the form of progressive breathlessness, requiring noninvasive ventilation. She developed type II respiratory failure hence, electively intubated and ventilated. She had persistent hypotension and hyponatreamia, which required high doses of inotropes, intravenous sodium correction. Despite our best efforts, she died secondary to multi-organ dysfunction. "
1532,S0278-2391(09)01428-1,"Extranodal Natural Killer T-Cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type, With Minimal Osseous Involvement: Report of a Case and Literature Review"," Report of a Case A 64-year-old woman presented to Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) with a chief complaint of nonresolving left midfacial and mandibular swelling. Approximately 2 months before presentation, the patient had sudden-onset facial swelling, predominantly affecting the soft tissues over the left midface and mandible. She initially believed the swelling to be related to an abscessed left maxillary premolar and presented to her general dentist, who started a course of penicillin and extracted the presumed offending tooth, without resolution of symptoms. The patient then underwent multiple consultations with various specialists (infectious disease, otolaryngology, and internal medicine) and hospital admissions for what was, at the time, presumed to be a facial infection of unknown origin. She underwent multiple courses of broad-spectrum enteral and parenteral antibiotic therapy without noticeable improvement. The nasal culture was negative for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and wound cultures from an incision and drainage via the left maxillary vestibule yielded no viable organisms. An extraoral biopsy specimen from the left submandibular lymph nodes, as well as an intraoral biopsy specimen from the affected soft tissue, showed only extensive necrosis. There were no data to suggest that immunohistochemical staining was completed at the time of initial biopsy. The facial swelling continued to increase, and the patient noted that the intraoral biopsy site failed to heal, remaining open and necrotic. The patient was referred to our emergency department by her otolaryngologist approximately 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. On presentation, she complained of swelling and necrotic tissue in the left maxillary vestibule. She denied nasal obstruction, dysosmia, regurgitation of oral contents into the nose, oronasal fistula, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, trigeminal neuropathy, or visual acuity changes. Her medical history was significant only for hypertension and dyslipidemia, and there was no known family history of malignancy. The patient was a former smoker (quit in 2005, 30–pack year history) and reported only minimal alcohol intake (<2 drinks per week). The medical history and review of systems were otherwise unremarkable in detail. Physical examination showed a well-developed, well-nourished woman with obvious facial asymmetry, who was in no apparent distress (Figs 1, 2).  She was found to be afebrile with stable vital signs. The midface swelling extended from the left lower eyelid to the left mandible in a craniocaudal direction and from the left oral commissure to the preauricular region in an anteroposterior direction, with erythema of the overlying skin. The swelling was firm, nonfluctuant, and minimally tender to palpation. No ecchymosis, bleeding, or discharge was noted. The nares were clear bilaterally; no intranasal masses were found. The facial nerve was weak in the left zygomatic, buccal, and marginal mandibular distributions. Of note, the patient was unaware of this weakness and denied any history of facial paresis. Intraorally, there was an area of focal necrosis in the left maxillary vestibule without evidence of exudate or bleeding (Fig 3). No saliva could be expressed from the Stensen's duct, which—along with the surrounding mucosa—was extremely indurated. In addition, there was a healing extraction site corresponding to the previous removal of a left mandibular molar. Laboratory testing included a complete blood count showing leukopenia (leukocyte count, 4,000/m3; normal range, 4,500-11,000/m3) and an unremarkable metabolic panel. Plain films taken at the time included a chest radiograph and orthopantograph. The chest radiograph did not show any evidence of cardiopulmonary disease or mediastinal mass. The orthopantograph showed evidence of periodontal bone loss but no periapical pathology. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast was performed and showed extensive soft tissue inflammation, with small pockets of subcutaneous inflammation, involving the left midface and neck, with associated lymphadenopathy (Figs 4, 5).  There was no definitive evidence of bony erosion or maxillary sinus involvement on the CT scan. The differential diagnosis included infectious etiologies such as osteomyelitis, parotid sialadenitis, or fungal infection (mucormycosis); rheumatologic processes such as Wegener granulomatosis; and neoplasms including squamous cell carcinoma, high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, liposarcoma, and lymphoma. The patient was admitted to the oral and maxillofacial surgery service and taken to the operating room for biopsy of the left facial mass and associated ipsilateral lymph nodes under general anesthesia. Tissue was sent for frozen section and permanent pathology. Initially, the histology of the biopsy specimen was interpreted as extensive necrosis without evidence of malignancy. Flow cytometry showed polyclonal B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells without evidence of abnormal antigen expression. However, given the protracted and unusual clinical course, immunohistochemical stains to investigate for the possibility of lymphoma or carcinoma were performed. These studies showed foci of enlarged lymphocytes within the necrotic tissue that were CD3+, CD7+, CD30+, and CD56+. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded ribonucleic acid was positive. The final pathologic diagnosis, based on the submitted tissue (Figs 6-8),   was ENKTCL. The patient was referred to the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center for treatment. Initial pretreatment staging, via positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, showed pulmonary nodules with fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, suggestive of disease involving the lungs. However, a subsequent transbronchial core biopsy was performed and showed only normal tissue, without evidence of tumor within the lung parenchyma. The patient was thus diagnosed with stage I disease. The patient was treated with 6 cycles of combined chemotherapy (CHOP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone]) and facial radiotherapy (dose, 52 Gy) over the course of 6 months (Fig 9) and has been in complete remission for approximately 1 year. She is currently being followed by a local oncologist, with clinical and laboratory surveillance every 3 months and restaging imaging (PET/CT) every 6 months for the first 3 years. "

1545,S1871-4048(16)00014-9,Burkitt lymphoma presenting as facial nerve paresis," 2 Case histories  2.1 Case 1 A previously healthy 3 year-old boy presented to our Emergency Department with worsening headaches and new-onset right facial palsy in the context of two months of progressive nasal congestion. In the prior weeks, he had been treated with both two weeks of cefdinir for bilateral acute otitis media that had initially been unresponsive to amoxicillin. He was subsequently diagnosed with adenoid hyperplasia and treated with ten days of prednisolone. However, symptoms persisted and two days prior to admission he was seen in Urgent Care and started on augmentin. Upon arrival to the ED the patient had normal vital signs with a white blood cell count of 12.9k/?L. C-reactive protein was 0.3mg/dL, also within normal limits. His head and neck examination was notable for a markedly hyponasal voice with thick drainage from his nares, right greater than left soft palatal fullness, a right middle ear serous effusion, and a right HB grade of III/VI. A head CT demonstrated an extensive mass in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx that extended to the central skull base and into the right tympanomastoid cavity, including the facial nerve canal. Diffuse lytic changes were seen involving the sphenoid body, pterygoid plates, maxillary sinus walls, ethmoid bones, medial orbital walls, and nasal septum. There was also effacement of fat planes in the right pterygopalatine fossa, retroantral region, masticator space, orbital apex, and parapharyngeal fat [Image 1(a) ]. On MRI the mass had signal characteristics suggestive of high cellularity: it was T1/T2 isointense with enhancement and restricted diffusion. It was also noted to involve the right foramen rotundum, foramen ovale, Meckel’s cave and cavernous sinus (Image 2 ). The patient was taken for urgent biopsy and remained intubated until postoperative day five due to concern for airway compromise from the extent of the mass. Pathology returned as BL and on postoperative day two he was started on treatment as per ANHL 1131 (Intergroup Trial for Children or Adolescents with B-Cell Non-Hodgkins Lymphome or B-Cell Acute Leukemia). At the initial start of therapy the patient’s facial nerve function had worsened to a HB grade IV/VI with incomplete eye closure. However, after completion of the first phase of induction chemotherapy, function improved to a grade II/VI. Repeat CT scan three weeks after diagnosis demonstrated that the mass had at least halved in size and the right tympanomastoid cavity had cleared [Image 1(b)]. Facial nerve function had recovered to grade I/VI by the end of consolidation chemotherapy.   2.2 Case 2 A 2-year-old boy developed right facial paralysis that was initially responsive to steroids and thought to be consistent with Bell’s palsy. However, his facial droop recurred as the steroids were tapered. The patient was then diagnosed with otitis media by his pediatrician and started on cefdinir. He remained with a right HB grade of VI/VI so was transitioned to augmentin, but symptoms still failed to improve. At that time he had no vital sign abnormalities and his white blood cell count was normal at 5.4k/?L. MRI showed bony expansion of the skull base and abnormal soft tissue in the right temporal bone extending into the parotid gland, sigmoid sinus, and jugular bulb. There was also focal enhancement in the fundus of the right internal auditory canal (Image 4). Corresponding head CT demonstrated associated periositis of the right mastoid bone, soft tissue filling the right middle ear cavity, and confirmed bony expansion of the skull base. Bony changes were thought to be consistent with fibrous dysplasia versus infection versus malignancy [Image 3(a)  ]. The patient underwent right myringotomy with cortical mastoidectomy and biopsy. Intraoperative findings included pus within the middle ear space, polypoid granulation tissue filling the mastoid antrum and air cells, and osteitis of the mastoid bone. Pathology returned as BL and he was treated per ANHL 1131. Initial facial nerve function remained at a HB grade of IV/VI after both his first and second round of induction chemotherapy, but improved to a grade of II/VI by the completion of treatment. He has remained in remission with only a slightly asymmetric smile noted on head and neck exam. His post-treatment CT scan demonstrated postsurgical changes of the right mastoid, but cleared middle ear space [Image 3(b)].  "
1550,S0145-2126(09)00420-2,Diabetes insipidus as main presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with hypophyseal involvement: Two case reports," 2 Case reports Case 1#: A 26-year-old male presented in March 2009 with a 5-month history of fatigue, polydipsia (highest 12L/24h) and progressive polyuria (up to 9–11L/day). He was found to have 15kg weight loss. Physical examination found no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or superficial lymphadenopathy but tenderness on sternum. Hemoglobin (Hb) was 62g/L, leukocyte and platelet counts were within normal range. Urine osmolality was found to be as low as 300mOsm/L. Urinary specific gravity (USG) was 1.007. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was 674u/L. Hypernatremia(152.4mmol/L) was noted. A chest and abdominal CT showed no lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) revealed hypocellularity with 45% infiltrate of lymphoblast and prolymphocyte (Fig. 1 ). Flow cytometry analysis identified a subpopulation of cells positive for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD34, and HLA-DR. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL3) was diagnosed, thus defining Burkitt lymphoma IVB (WHO classification). A brain MRI noted alterations in the hypophysis. The pituitary stalk was enlarged and the normal hyperintense signal was absent at the posterior lobe (Fig. 3A). The international prognostic index (IPI) was assessed to be high risk. Chemotherapy on CHOEP schedule (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, epirubicin, VP-16, prednisone) was introduced. After one course, serum sodium was restored to normal rapidly and LDH dropped to 342.1u/L.Hb increased to 90g/L. Urine volume was reduced to 5–6L/day after oral DDAVP administration at a dose of 0.2mg twice daily. USG reached 1.018 and urine osmolality increased to 680mOsm/L. Two weeks after the first course, urine volume became normal (1.5–2.0L/day) and polydipsia disappeared. DDAVP was thus gradually withdrawn. A revaluation of BMA showed complete remission (CR). A new brain MRI noted a reduction in the size of the pituitary stalk but persistent absence of the normal hyperintense signal at the posterior pituitary (Fig. 3B). Subsequently a second course on the same CHOEP schedule was repeated. However, within 2 months, he presented with a recurrence of the original symptoms. Urine output increased to 3–4L/day along with a descent in USG (1.007) and urine osmolality(300mOsm/L). BMA showed a relapse with 24% of lymphoblast and prolymphocyte. Chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, pirarubicin, vinorelbine, VP-16, prednisone) was instituted for the third and fourth course and oral DDAVP was resumed at a dose of 0.1mg twice daily but gradually withdrawn again. Urine volume was controlled within 2.5L/day with normal USG and urine osmolality. However, BMA showed only partial remission with 14% lymphoblast and prolymphocyte. Thus chemotherapy (mitoxantrone, cytarabine, dexamethasone) was instituted for the fifth and sixth course (total six courses) together with thalidomide at a daily oral dose of 100mg for 21 days per month. He was leading a comparatively normal life, though his BMA showed hypercellularity with 12.5% prolymphocyte. Hb was 100g/L. LDH was 463.3u/L. Liver function was slightly impaired due to chronic activating hepatitis B. A reformed CODOX-M/IVAC regimen was planned for the next course. At present, he is followed regularly. Case 2#: A 20-year-old male was admitted in October 2008 for complaints of pain all over the body in the previous 10 months and gradual polyuria for 2 months (up to 13L/day). He had run a high fever for two weeks. Enlarged lymph nodes were palpable on neck and groin. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. USG was 1.011 and urine osmolality was 470mOsm/L. Mild anemia was found. LDH was 1161.2u/L. Electrolyte and immunoglobulins were normal. Retroperitoneal lymphadenomegaly was indicated by ultrasonic examination. Bone SPECT scan showed various lesions in cranium, the 5th right posterior rib, the third lumbar vertebra, left sacro-iliac articulation and right acetabulum. BMA showed 23% infiltrate of lymphoblast and prolymphocyte. Bone marrow biopsy revealed scattered infiltration of lymphomatous cells with moderate fibrosis. Biopsies for lymph nodes both on neck and groin were undertaken. Histopathology revealed lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (Fig. 2 ). Immunohistochemistry exhibited CD20 large cell(+), CD45RB(?), CD3(?), CD45Ro(?), bcl-2 focal(+), ALK(?), CD15(?), CD30(?), CD5(?), marginal CD138(+). B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma IVB was defined. A brain MRI scan showed an empty sella with pituitary flattened to 2mm in height and absence of the normal hyperintense signal at the posterior lobe. Nodular enhancing focus was noted in the inferior region of the hypothalamus with 5mm in diameter indicating infiltration and obstruction (Fig. 3 C). IPI was assessed to be high risk. Chemotherapy on schedule CHOEP (cyclophosphamide, pirarubicin, vinorelbine, VP-16, prednisone) was given. Oral DDAVP was added at a dose of 0.1mg three times daily. Pain and fever were relieved. Urine output reduced to 5–7L/day with USG around 1.005. LDH was restored to normal. But urine osmolality was around 230mOsm/L. After two courses, superficial lymph nodes disappeared. Radiotherapy was administered to the whole brain (total dosage 18Gy) but was interrupted due to tympanitis. Six more courses on CHOEP schedule (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vindesine, VP-16, prednisone) were repeated (total eight courses) and the urine volume was controlled within 2L/day with oral DDAVP at a maintenance dose of 0.15mg/day. USG and osmolality increased to normal. Previous symptoms were in remission. Abdomen ultrasound indicated resolution of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. A new pituitary MRI noted no alteration in appearance or signal of the hypophysis in contrast with that before therapy but shrink of the previous nodular enhancing focus in the inferior region of the hypothalamus (Fig. 3D). BMA reexamination showed hypocellularity without lymphoblast or prolymphocyte. "
1554,S2152-2650(11)00218-7,Testis-Isolated Mantle Cell Lymphoma: A Unique Case," Introduction Approximately 1%-2% of all lymphoma cases are primary testicular lymphoma. 1  Testicular lymphoma usually arises in older men, and the histiologic subtype is most often diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Other histologies, for example, mantle cell lymphoma, are very rare. A relatively large series from Massachusetts General Hospital was published in 1994 that describes 69 cases of malignant lymphoma of the testis, epididymis, and spermatic cord. 2  There was only 1 tumor consistent with the currently recognized entity of mantle cell lymphoma (described as centrocytic lymphoma histology Kiel subtype, diffuse small cleaved cell histology by Working Formulation). In a recently published series of 18 primary testicular lymphomas diagnosed over a 2-year period at an Austrian center, all were DLBCL except for 1 lymphoma, not otherwise specified (sparse biopsy material available), and 2 mantle cell lymphomas, pleomorphic subtype. 3  The lymphoma group at MD Anderson Cancer Center identified 1 case of mantle cell lymphoma with testicular involvement in more than 300 testicular lymphoma cases seen over a decade at that institution. 4  All 4 of the above testicular mantle cell lymphomas were at advanced stage. At our center, we recently evaluated a patient with mantle cell lymphoma localized to the testis. We systematically surveyed our institutional experience with mantle cell lymphoma, searching for any other patients with testis involvement. Of 897 patients with mantle cell lymphoma, we found 1 additional patient case with (bilateral) testicular involvement. "
1562,S0385-8146(98)00083-2,Case report: exranodal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the parapharyngeal space," 2 Case report A 19-year-old man presented with a 10-day history of sore throat, headache and otalgia on the right. On physical examination, the right tonsil and lateral pharyngeal wall were found to protrude medially, and the right hypoglassal nerve was paralyzed. No cervical adenopathy was palpable. Palpation of the oropharynx, including the base of the tongue, did not reveal any masses. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable, and X-ray of the chest looked normal. Results of laboratory tests including complete blood count, Westergren sedimentation rate for erythrocytes, glucose levels, and electrolytes were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck showed a tumoral mass involving the parapharyngeal space (but not the oropharynx) and extending laterally to the mandible, superiorly to the pterygoid muscle, and posteriorly to the prevertebral region. There was no adenopathy nor any destruction of the skull-base (Fig. 1 ). Aspirated bone marrow was normal. Computerized tomographic (CT) scans of the abdomen and thorax showed adenopathy in the right axilla. From these studies it was determined that the tumor was Stage IIE. We took three biopsies from the lateral pharyngeal wall and were able to establish the diagnosis of lymphoma from histologic examination of tissues. Studying the stained tissues with hematoxylin and eosin under light microscopy, using the formulation by Rappaport and Working, we noted many mitotic figures (consistent with diffuse large-cell lymphoma) as well as large tumor cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli (consistent with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma) (Fig. 2 ). Studies using lymphocyte markers under immunocytochemical staining revealed a phenotype typical of B-cells. The patient was referred to members of the medical faculty in the Department of Hematology of Istanbul University for further care. The patient underwent three courses of CHOP (Cytoxan® 750 mg/m2, day 1, Adriamycin® 50 mg/m2, day 1, Oncovin®, 2 mg, day 1, and Prednisone 100 mg/day, 5 day) chemotherapy day 21 period of time and he was given one course of 5000 rads of radiation to the parapharyngeal region. Treatment did not control the disease, and again he underwent two courses of CHOP-chemotherapy. Several weeks later he developed a recurrence on the vertebrae. Despite the aggressive chemotherapy, the patient died 7 months after first presenting. "

1575,S2152-2650(11)70124-0,Analysis of 31 Cases of Primary Breast Lymphoma: The Effect of Nodal Involvement and Microvascular Density," Patients and Methods  Patients Between June 1977 to March 2007, 31 patients fullfilling all clinical and pathologic diagnostic criteria for PBL according to Wiseman and Liao's proposition were identified. These patients accounted for 0.25% of the patients with NHL seen in our hospital over the same period. The clinical presentation was indistinguishable from that of breast cancer. Initial staging procedures included a complete physical examination, complete blood cell count, liver and renal function tests, bone marrow biopsy, and a chest x-ray. Mammograms were obtained in all patients. Because of the time period of the study, the use of computed tomography (CT), including thorax, abdominal, and pelvic scans, was variable. In the current study, all pathologic specimens were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis according to World Health Organization (WHO) classifications. The median follow-up for patients was 67 months (range, 6-288 months). Patients were requested to be followed-up at 3-month intervals during the first 2 years after treatment, and then at least once per year at our hospital or other cancer hospitals convenient for them. Every year after the treatment, patients were contacted by mail or telephone to track the outcome. Follow-up rate was 100% for our sample.   Immunohistochemistry and Microvessel Count Immunohistochemistry for CD34 (1:10 dilution; Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was performed on 4-µm sections, which were placed on glass slides, baked for 1 hour at 60°C, deparaffinized in xylene, and hydrated in a graded series of alcohol. Microvessel densities were evaluated by counting the number of CD34+ microvessels in the entire 1.0-mm core at 100× (10× lens, 10× ocular) using an Olympus BX45 microscope (Center Valley, PA), with the average score reported. Microvessel density counts denoted as “high” were above the median score of 22.9, and those denoted as “low” were below the median score. 4,5  Images of immunohistologic staining were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope and Nikon digital camera using a × 40/0.75 NA Plan Fluor objective lens. Digitized images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7 image processing and manipulation software. A microvessel was defined as any distinct CD34+ cell or cell cluster. Presence of a vessel lumen was not a requirement for defining a microvessel. 6     Statistical Analysis All calculations were performed with SPSS v10.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). ?2 analysis was used to compare the patient characteristics (age, tumor size, tumor side, mastectomy) between groups (stage I and II). Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the start of therapy until the time of disease progression or until the end of the observation period in patients without a progressive disease. Overall survival was measured until death from any cause or the end of the observation period. Both PFS and OS were also measured from the date the therapy was started. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used for analyzing differences between curves. We regarded nodal involvement and microvascular density as predictor variables and the relative influence of these variables on PFS and OS was studied using multivariate analysis according to the nonparametric hazards model of Cox. Significance was set at P ? .05.  "
1583,S2352-5126(16)30145-X,"Petechial, purpuric, and ecchymotic presentation of cutaneous Cryptococcus in mantle cell lymphoma"," Case report A 71-year-old, HIV-negative white man with MCL was admitted to the hospital with malaise, fatigue, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, constipation, and night sweats. After the initial diagnosis of MCL 7 months previously, he received 3 doses of bendamustine-rituximab, each 1 month apart. The MCL did not respond to rituximab, and the patient was started on ibrutinib (560 mg/d) 4 months before admission, which also failed to stall disease progression, prompting another switch of chemotherapeutic agent. Bortezomib infusions on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 were begun 1 month before admission. On the day of admission, the patient came to the hospital to begin his second cycle of bortezomib complaining of a rash of 2 weeks' duration. He was admitted, and all chemotherapy was held. He was normotensive and afebrile with oxygen saturation of 97%. Physical examination found a slowly expanding, asymptomatic, rash with 10- 30-cm patches of dusky erythema studded with 1- to 2-mm purpuric papules that appeared bilaterally on the forearms, antecubital fossae, right side of the neck, right inguinal fold, and lower abdomen. In addition, scattered pin-point petechial and larger ecchymotic macules were present on the upper extremities and trunk (Fig 1 ). A punch biopsy specimen was obtained from purpuric papules with an erythematous base. One-half was sent for pathologic examination and one-half for bacterial (routine and anaerobes), acid-fast bacilli, and fungal cultures. Encapsulated yeast was identified on hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections (Fig 2 ). Gomori methenamine silver (Fig 3 ) and periodic acid–Schiff stained the walls of the yeast. Mucicarmine stained the thick capsules of these organisms. Blood and tissue cultures both grew Cryptococcus. The patient was started on fluconazole, which was escalated to amphotericin B and flucytosine. Despite multiple platelet transfusions, the patient had persistent thrombocytopenia, and he died 2 weeks after admission. "
1587,S0090-3019(97)00362-5,Cerebellopontine angle lymphoma: a case report and review of the literature," Case report A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on October 25, 1993 with dizziness and nausea of 2 months’ duration. She had an unsteady gait, but denied rotatory vertigo or a hearing disturbance. Physical examination disclosed an overweight, alert woman. Her neurologic examination was normal except for the following findings: a somewhat unsteady gait with a tendency to deviate to the left, and fine horizontal nystagmus toward the left on lateral gaze. Her 7th and 5th cranial nerve function was normal, and other lower cranial nerves also were intact. CT revealed a slight high-density mass in the left CP angle with homogeneous enhancement. This mass lesion seemed to have an attachment with a broad base abutting the petrous pyramid (Figure 1).  No adjacent bony abnormality was present. The internal auditory canal was intact and not eroded. MRI revealed a left CP angle mass lesion with low intensity on the T1-weighted image, iso-intensity on the T2-weighted image, and iso-intensity on the T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced image (Figure 2).  The fourth ventricle and the lateral-dorsal aspect of the pons were compressed. Low-grade perifocal edema was detected on the T2-weighted image. A peritumoral band, which suggested the presence of an extra-axial mass, was recognized on MRI. The lesion was avascular on angiography. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, including CSF cytology, were nondiagnostic. A differential diagnosis of meningioma or neurinoma was considered preoperatively. Without a definitive preoperative diagnosis, a left lateral suboccipital craniectomy and subtotal removal of the tumor were performed on October 28, 1993. Macroscopically, the tumor appeared as a slightly hard, space-occupying mass with ill-defined borders. The cut surface was granular and had a dark yellow or pale gray color. The attachment of the tumor to the pyramidal bone was dissected with little bleeding. The tumor involved both the 7th and 8th cranial nerves. Tumor infiltration, which was around the nerve bundles, was observed along the nerves into the fundus of the internal auditory canal. This tumor was considered to arise from subarachnoid space in the cerebellopontine cistern. Postoperatively, light microscopy was used to confirm the diagnosis histologically. The pathology report indicated that the tumor was most likely a meningioma without evidence of malignancy. Because there were a lot of artifacts in the surgically removed specimen, the pathologist was unable to make a definitive diagnosis. On the 23rd hospital day, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Horizontal nystagmus and broad based gait remained. Hearing disturbance or facial palsy on her left side were not detected. On MRI 1 month after the tumor excision, a small recurrent tumor was detected. A small amount of residual tumor existed in the surrounding cerebellum. Within 50 days after the tumor excision, it recurred. Given the progression of dizziness, headache, vomiting, and ataxic gait with clouding of her consciousness, we suspected regrowth of the tumor. CT and MRI revealed a mass lesion in the left CP angle, which occupied almost the same volume as that before tumor excision. Neither hearing loss nor facial nerve palsy was present. Surgical excision of the tumor was performed again on December 22, 1993. Microscopic examination of this surgical specimen revealed malignant lymphoma. A representative sample is shown in Figure 3.  There is diffuse infiltration by cohesive sheets of undifferentiated lymphoma cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, which were round and occasionally cleaved. Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining with L26, a B-cell marker, consistent with a B-cell type lymphoma (Figure 4).   Pelvic, abdominal, and chest CT scans, a gallium citrate Ga 67 scan, and a bone marrow biopsy failed to detect any other evidence of lymphoma. No uveal or vitreous involvement of the eye was detected. Antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was negative. The patient received 4,000 rads of whole-brain irradiation and 1,000 rads to a reduced field encompassing her primary site. Chemotherapy could not be performed, because she and her family refused it. During irradiation, she enjoyed a complete recovery from her headaches and altered consciousness, and a partial improvement in her dizziness and ataxic gait. At the time of this writing, 27 months after irradiation, she has experienced no recurrence of her symptoms, nor has a recurrent tumor been detected by MRI. "
1597,S0730-725X(98)00178-7,Primary lymphoma of the breast: MR imaging features. A case report," Case report A 52-year-old woman presented with a lump in her right breast that had grown rapidly in the previous weeks. On clinical breast examination, a firm, slightly mobile mass with skin thickening was palpated. No enlarged lymph nodes were found. Mammography revealed a 6-cm, well-circumscribed, high-density lesion in the upper–outer quadrant of the right breast with skin thickening (Fig. 1).  The “halo-sign” was partially seen. The overall density of the breast was normal, and no microcalcifications were observed. Sonography showed the mass to be solid with low internal homogeneous echoes. Stereotactic core needle biopsy was performed with a Lorad MII with Stereolock system using a 14-gauge needle with five cylinders obtained in the same session and processed by the Pathology Department. Histologic study showed infiltration of the breast by NHL (high-grade malignancy; middle-large cell; type B). MR imaging was performed with a 1 Tesla system (Siemens Magnetom Impact, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a specially developed double breast coil. The patient was imaged prone and the following MR imaging protocols were used: 1) an initial axial T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence (TR/TE, 4250/90; section thickness 4 mm; matrix 252 × 256; FoV 350 × 350); 2) an axial three-dimensional dynamic T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (FLASH 3D; TR/TE/FA, 13.9/7/25; section thickness 2 mm; matrix 128 × 256; FoV 320 × 320) before and during the administration of intravenous (i.v.) Gd-DTPA (0.16 mmol/kg) with images performed at 2, 4, and 6 min; and 3) an axial two-dimensional T1-weighted gradient-echo fat-supressed sequence (FLASH 2D; TR/TE/FA, 324/6/90; section thickness 8 mm; matrix 128 × 256; FoV 350 × 350) before and after i.v. Gd-DTPA administration. The T2-weighted images showed a lobulated, well-circumscribed mass in the upper–outer quadrant of the right breast that was slightly hyperintense relative to parenchyma (Fig. 2).  On the T1-weighted images, the mass was isointense relative to parenchyma. MR images also show skin thickening. On the three-dimensional dynamic images, the lesion showed strong and rapid enhancement, with an increase in signal intensity of more than 80% in the first three minutes after contrast material injection (Fig. 3).  This behavior is considered to be suspicious for malignancy according to the criteria described by Heywang-Köbrunner.3  Laboratory tests, chest and abdominal CT, and bone marrow biopsy showed no involvement of other sites. The patient underwent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy with clinical remission. A new MR was done 5 months later and demonstrated complete resolution of the mass (Fig. 4).  Ten months later, the patient presented with hepatic and suprarenal lymphoma and chemotherapy was reinitiated. "
1599,S0303-8467(11)00075-8,A case of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma," 2 Case report A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of progressive distal paresthesia and gait disturbance. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 15 years ago and felt tingling sense on the distal parts of the extremities 5–6 years ago. The distal paresthesia progressed to the levels of the elbow and knee joints 5 days ago and gait disturbance developed. Neurologic examination in the emergency room revealed facial diplegia, bilateral weakness, and hypesthesia in the lower extremities, decreased vibratory-pinprick sensation, and tendon areflexia in all four limbs. According to the Hughes functional scoring system (FS) [4], the score was 4 at that time. Serologic testing showed a marked decrease in the platelet count (37,000/?L), but a purpuric rash was not observed. Electrophysiologic studies demonstrated absence of the F waves, prolonged distal latencies, and diffuse reduction of motor conduction velocity (Table 1 ). Elevated protein level (164.4mg/dL) without pleocytosis was noted in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Serum anti-ganglioside antibodies (anti-GM1/GM2/GD1a/GD1b/GD3/GT1b/GQ1b/galactocerebroside/MAG Abs) were all negative. No morphologic abnormalities were detected in the peripheral blood smear. Bone marrow aspiration revealed normal megakaryocyte counts; dysplasia and apparent lymphoma cell invasion were not observed. Screening tests for autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody (Ab), anti-SS A/SS B Ab, anti-cardiolipin Ab, antineutrophil cytoplasmic Abs (P-ANCA and C-ANCA), and platelet-associated Ab/anti-platelet Ab were negative. There was no monoclonal gammopathy. Serum IgG (2603.84mg/dL; normal, 960–1960mg/dL) and IgA (436mg/dL; normal, 110–410mg/dL) were elevated and FANA showed a homogeneous speckled pattern (1:160). He denied any preceding upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infections before the development of neurologic symptoms and signs and we excluded infections of Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and varicella zoster virus via serologic tests. Levels of thyroid hormones and vitamin B12 were within normal limits. No other abnormal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic causes of peripheral neuropathy were disclosed. With an impression of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), we managed the patient with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, 0.4g/kg/day for 5 days). Symptoms and signs were improved and he could walk independently (FS, 2) with a normalized platelet count (148,000/?L) 1 month from the initiation of treatment. Two month after the symptom onset, the patient felt bilateral leg weakness (FS, 4) and the platelet count decreased again (71,000/?L). In nerve conduction studies, findings became worse than the previous study (Table 1). Neurologic conditions rapidly deteriorated and the patient complained of dysphagia and dyspnea. On the 4th day of the second episode, he needed mechanical ventilation due to atelectasis and hypercapnia (115mmHg). We treated him with IVIg (0.4g/kg/day for 5 days) and oral prednisolone therapy (1mg/kg/day) for a tentative diagnosis of acute-onset CIDP. With IVIg and prednisolone therapy, he was weaned 5 days later from the mechanical ventilation, and 2 months later he was capable of walking without assistance. At the time of discharge, the clinical examination revealed only mild facial and limb weakness and hyporeflexia in all four limbs (FS, 2). Ten months after the onset of initial symptoms, he noticed multiple small, non-tender, erythematous papules scattered over the anterior and posterior trunks (Fig. 1A and B). The platelet count was 51,000/?L at that time. Neurologic examination revealed hypesthesia and hyporeflexia on the ankle and knee jerks. However, there was no evidence of progression of motor weakness or sensory symptoms. Improvement was observed on the follow-up nerve conduction studies (Table 1). Skin biopsy revealed superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial lymphohistocystic cell infiltration. Immunohistochemical investigations demonstrated that the majority of the small lymphoid cells expressed the CD3 and CD5 antigens, but they were not stained with B-cell markers (CD20 and CD30; Fig. 1C and D). The pathologic findings of the skin lesion were compatible with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and no evidence of systemic lymphoma was found. The skin lesions were managed successfully with topical steroids. "

Chest radiograph (Fig. 1 ) and CT scan revealed a round mass in the upper field of the left lung. On examination, he appeared well with no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A complete blood count revealed hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dl; leukocyte counts: 4.7×109/l with 59.8% neutrophils, 27.3% lymphocytes, 11.0% monocytes, 1.5% eosinophils and 0.4% basophils; platelet count 162×109/dl. Serum immunoglobulin M was elevated to 1540 mg/dl. HIV was negative and rheumatoid factor was high but there were no abnormalities in antinuclear antibody, C3, C4, CH50 with serologic test. There were no physical findings which correlated with autoimmune disease, such as arthritis or xerostomia. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy was nondiagnostic. Open lung biopsy was performed. The patient underwent left upper and lower lobe wedge resection of multiple nodules on visceral pleura.

He also complained nausea, vomiting, and weakness, without associated fever, chills, chest pain, hematemesis, melena, cough, dysuria or hematuria. Physical examination was notable for tachycardia (heart rate: 110/min) and slightly distant heart sounds. The laboratory studies on admission included a white blood cell count of 7.2K/mm3 (60% neutrophils, 31% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes and 1% eosinophil), a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7g/dL, a hematocrit of 42.6%, and a platelet count of 239K/mm3. Blood chemistry tests were normal except for a mild decrease in sodium level at 134mmol/L, a mild decrease in bicarbonate at 18mmol/L, and a mild elevation in creatinine at 1.32mg/dl. Liver function tests showed total bilirubin 1.5mg/dL, AST 51U/L, ALT 29U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 317U/L. Urinalysis was within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 1 ) revealed a 7.3×5.2×7.5-cm lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right heart arising from the interventricular septum extending into the right atrium and extending into the extracardiac space through the base of the heart. Several small nodules were also seen in the pericardial space with a moderate size pericardial effusion as well as bilateral pleural effusions. An echocardiogram study showed normal left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55% to 60%, a large intracardiac mass from the interventricular septum to the tricuspid valve, filling the right atrium and ventricle, with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Given the large size, resection of the mass was impossible. Therefore, a transvenous biopsy of the intracardiac mass was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy from the intracardiac mass revealed a large cell lymphoma consistent with plasmablastic lymphoma. After the procedure, the patient began to develop signs of significant right-sided heart failure with elevated transaminitis, increased lower extremity edema, worsening pleural effusion, and ascites. The pleural fluid was tapped for respiratory relief, which showed involvement by plasmablastic lymphoma. Due to signs of early cardiogenic shock, the patient was put on pressor support. He was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible septic shock. In order to reverse his acute decompensation, the patient received 1 dose of radiation therapy in addition to the full course R-CHOP chemotherapy. A repeat echocardiogram showed no changes in the size of the intracardiac mass. The patient's mental status, blood pressure and oxygen requirement continued to worsen. Given that he did not respond to therapy, the patient was transferred to comfort care and passed away. "
1638,S0013-9351(10)00203-3,Polychlorinated biphenyls and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: A case–control study in Northern Italy," 2 Methods  2.1 Study population Both incident and deceased adult cases were included, registered under codes 200 and 202 of the International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9). Subjects present in both groups were considered as incident cases. Incident cases were identified from the Cancer Registry of the Brescia Local Health Authority as subjects with a new diagnosis of an NHL between 1993 and 1995 and between 1999 and 2001, the periods for which information on incident cases was available. Deceased cases were identified from the Local Health Authority archive for the years 1990–2004. Possible duplicates were eliminated. The population of Brescia was 187,567 inhabitants at the 2001 census. Approximately three controls were randomly selected for each case from the Brescia National Population Registry and frequency matched to both incident and deceased LNH cases according to age and sex. Two series of controls were selected: the first one was sampled among all residents alive on 31st December 1995 matched to the NHL cases diagnosed between 1993 and 1995; the second one sampled among all residents alive on 31st December 2001 matched to the cases diagnosed between 1999 and 2001. Control subjects who were affected by an NHL according to our database and the duplicates were excluded. Data from the 2001 population census were used to define the educational level of cases and controls.   2.2 Assessment of exposure Exposure to PCBs was attributed on the basis of the lifetime residence history of cases and controls, provided by the Brescia Municipal Authority, since residence in the contaminated areas was considered a proxy of individual exposure to these substances. Two cases were excluded because their residential histories were not available. Administrative data were obtained from the Municipality register, which are of high quality in Italy and have been widely used for epidemiological reports in international journals and databases. The town of Brescia consists of nine districts divided into 30 suburbs; exposure was defined on the basis of both spatial and temporal criteria. With regard to the spatial criterion, the town was divided into the following four areas according to PCB soil levels and administrative boundaries ( Fig. 1):  • Area A: immediately south of the PCB-producing factory, with a population of about 1200 inhabitants, the most highly polluted area. In 48 soil samples, the arithmetic mean, median and range of total PCBs were 1.14, 0.55 and 0.01–8.3mg/kg, respectively.   • Area B: a larger area south of Area A, with 15,000 inhabitants and intermediate levels of soil contamination. In 129 soil samples, the arithmetic mean, median and range of total PCBs were 0.21, 0.07 and <0.01–2.6mg/kg, respectively.   • Area C: east of area A, with about 2000 inhabitants and intermediate levels of soil contamination. In 21 soil samples, the arithmetic mean, median and range of total PCBs were 0.15, 0.08 and 0.01–0.8mg/kg, respectively.   • Area D: the least polluted area, which includes all the other parts of the town, representing the control population, with about 170,000 inhabitants. In 82 soil samples, the arithmetic mean, median and range of total PCBs were 0.03, 0.02 and <0.01–0.38mg/kg, respectively.    In the analysis, we considered polluted areas A, B and C separately and all together. We used three definitions of time exposure: (1) main residence, where each subject had lived for most of his/her life; (2) residence for at least one year, considered as the minimum exposure time for developing possible PCB-related NHL; (3) duration of residence, categorized in three classes, 1–9, 10–19 and 20+ years, or dichotomized as 1–9 and 10+ years. In the analysis for duration of residence, separate analyses were performed for areas A, B and C. Subjects who resided in more than one area for 1–9, 10–19 or 20+ years were considered among the exposed in each analysis. Subjects who resided for 1–9 years in one area (e.g., area A) and 10–19 or 20+ years in the other areas (e.g., B and C) were excluded from the analyses for the first area (e.g., area A). We did not exclude any period longer than one year of residence before diagnosis or death for cases or before enrollment for controls, because latency between carcinogen exposure and neoplasm development is extremely variable and may be as short as a few years (Engel et al., 2007b). A latency analysis is not feasible in our study, however, due to its retrospective design, since duration and latency are strongly related to each other and cannot be analyzed separately. The years spent outside the town were considered as non-exposure periods. In each analysis, we considered those subjects as not exposed who had never resided, or had resided for less than one year in any of the polluted areas, according to the spatial and temporal residence criteria. Since some workers at the PCB-producing plant may have had higher exposure to PCBs than the general population, we checked whether the cases and controls had worked at the factory in their lifetime by means of record-linkage with the files of the factory workers.   2.3 Statistical analysis The odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age and education, although socio-economic factors do not appear to be associated with an NHL incidence or mortality (Faggiano et al., 1997; Fabbro-Peray et al., 2001; Hermann et al., 2009). To evaluate the role of duration of residence, categorized in three classes, we performed linear trend tests using logistic regression models and adjusting for age and gender. Education was omitted in the final regression models as it did not influence the OR estimates for residence. Separate analyses were carried out for incident cases only. Statistical tests were performed using the common cut-off of p=0.05 with two tails, for rejecting the null hypothesis. All the analyses were conducted using the Stata statistical software package (version 10.0, Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas).  "

His medical history was notable for a 20-year-long history of diabetes mellitus (DM), and he had been receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for the past six years to treat DM nephropathy. Laboratory findings determined upon admission were a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 375 × 109/L, and a white blood cell count of 3.8 × 109/L with 9% blasts and 22.6% eosinophils. A cervical lymph node biopsy established a diagnosis of precursor T lymphoblastic lymphoma. Lymphoblasts expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and CD1a, CD2, CD3, and CD5. Bone marrow showed infiltration by 15% agranular blast cells, which, on the basis of immunophenotyping, were identified as having the same lineage T cells. Eosinophilia was mild (8.9% of marrow for all nucleated cells) and myeloid hyperplasia was not evident. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow aspirates showed a 45,XY,dic(8;12)(p11.2;p11.2)[4]/46,XY[16] karyotype (Fig. 1 ). Polymerase chain reaction determined rearrangement of T-cell receptor TCR-r. BCR-ABL1 translocation, JAK-2 mutation, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), and tyrosine kinase domain mutations were absent. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated the absence of an FIP1L1/PDGFRA gene rearrangement. Metaphase FISH for CEP8 with the use of a SpectrumAqua probe (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Des Plains, IL) and CEP12 SpectrumOrange probe (Abbott Molecular/Vysis) determined that the derivative chromosome 8 contained both CEP8 and CEP12. After the patient received standard treatment for remission with induction chemotherapy, the peripheral eosinophilia and blasts soon disappeared. Unfortunately, however, the patient died of cardiac arrest during first-line chemotherapy."

1669,S0145-2126(09)00260-4,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes defined by common translocations: Utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a case–control study," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study population The FARM study, a population-based study of incident, pathologically confirmed hemolymphatic cancer cases including NHL in Iowa and Minnesota men, was conducted to evaluate associations with agricultural, other occupational, lifestyle, and medical factors. The study population and methods were previously described in detail [7,8]. Briefly, cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1983 among white men aged 30 or older were identified through hospital and pathology laboratory records (in Minnesota) and the State Health Registry of Iowa. The study was restricted to white men from areas other than metropolitan Minnesota in order to increase the proportion with agricultural exposures, the primary focus of the study. Eighty-nine percent (694) of 780 ascertained NHL cases were enrolled, and the diagnosis of NHL was confirmed for 622 cases by a pathology review panel [7–9]. NHL cases were limited to solid tumors; therefore lymphocytic leukemias were not included in the NHL case subgroup. Controls were 1245 white males aged 30 or older without a history of hemolymphatic cancer that were frequency-matched to cases by age (within five-year groups), state, and vital status. Between 1981 and 1984, detailed information on agricultural exposures, other occupational exposures, medical history, smoking, and other potential risk factors for NHL were obtained through in-person structured interviews of cases and controls, or the next-of-kin of deceased cases and controls [7,10–12].   2.2  t(14;18)-PCR study In 1997, archival paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were requested and successfully retrieved for 248 FARM study NHL cases (40% of all NHL cases in the original study) [5,6]. Over half of the tumor blocks that were not retrieved had been destroyed or lost; the remainder were held at institutions that declined to participate in the t(14;18)-NHL study. Up to sixteen 5-?m sections and sixteen 10-?m sections were cut from each archival block. A single pathologist (GAD) reviewed the first, middle, and last sections to confirm the presence of tumor tissue and assign NHL subtypes according to the Revised European American Lymphoma classification scheme (REAL) [13]. Five-?m sections and slides were processed with diethyl procarbonate (DEPC) to prevent DNAse or RNAse from interfering with future assays [14].  t(14;18)-PCR assays were performed on DNA extracted from 10-?m sections cut from archival tumor blocks [5,6]. Each reaction used a consensus primer corresponding to the J segment of the IGH gene on chromosome 14 (5?-ACCTGAGGAGACGGTGAGC-3?) and a second primer corresponding to the BCL2 major breakpoint region (MBR) on chromosome 18 (MBR1: 5?-GAGAGTTGCTTTACGTG-GCCTG-3?). Negative samples were subjected to a second PCR reaction with the IGH consensus primer and a second BCL2 primer 360 base pairs upstream of the MBR primer (MBR2: 5?-CGCTTGACTCCTTTACGTGCTG-3?). Amplified DNA was isolated, denatured, and separated by gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane using a Southern blot procedure. Amplification was confirmed using radiolabeled probes that hybridized to DNA adjacent to each BCL2 primer site. A 175-base pair segment of the human hemoglobin beta (HBB) gene was amplified as an internal positive control to confirm that the DNA extracted from each sample was adequate for PCR amplification of t(14;18). Fifty-seven samples that were HBB-negative were classified as inadequate for PCR. Amplification products from 20 of the 68 t(14;18)-positive samples were sequenced to confirm that unique translocation breakpoints were amplified from each sample.   2.3  t(14;18)-FISH study For the current study, commercially available FISH IGH and t(14;18) assays were run on 5-?m sections archived from FARM study tumor blocks (Vysis/Abbot Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). All sections were stored at 4°C prior to use. NHL subtypes were updated according to a modified version of the WHO classification scheme based on morphology only [15]. Cases that would be classified as chronic lymphocytic leukemias/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL/SLL) according to the WHO scheme are referred to as small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL) since study cases were limited to solid tumors only. The majority of cases classified as diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL) were probably diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL); however, B cell status was not confirmed. Cases classified as Burkitt lymphomas (BL) include both Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphomas. Assays were run according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abbot Molecular/Vysis, Des Plaines, IL) with minor modifications (as described below). Translocations involving IGH on chromosome 14 were identified using the LSI® IGH Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe which includes a 900 kilobase pair (kb) SpectrumGreen-labeled probe that hybridizes to the entire IGH variable (V) region, and a 250kb SpectrumOrange-labeled probe that hybridizes to the 3? flanking region (Fig. 1A) (Abbot Molecular/Vysis, Des Plaines, IL). In a translocation-negative cell, the expected signal pattern is two orange/green (yellow) fusion signals (Fig. 2A). In translocation-positive cells, separation of one pair of probes produces one orange and one green signal in addition to the fusion signal associated with the normal copy of IGH (Fig. 2B). t(14;18) translocations were identified using the LSI® IGH/BCL2 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe which includes a 1.5 mega base pair SpectrumGreen probe that spans the entire IGH locus plus 300kb centromerically, and a 750kb SpectrumOrange probe that covers BCL2 plus 250kb beyond each end of the gene (Fig. 1C). The expected signal pattern in a normal nucleus is two orange and two green signals (Fig. 2C). In translocation-positive cells, juxtaposition of an orange and green probe produces one fusion signal in addition to the separate orange and green signals associated with the normal copies of IGH and BCL2 (Fig. 2D). We assayed all cases with at least two 5-?m sections available (n =230) for any IGH translocation (IGH-FISH). To increase efficiency t(14;18)-FISH assays were performed only on samples that were of adequate quality to successfully classify them as positive or negative based on the IGH assay (n =166). Deparaffinization and pretreatment of archival 5-?m sections was performed using the Vysis® VP2000™ Processor (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Des Plaines, IL). Next, a probe mixture containing a 7:1:2 ratio of buffer, fluorescent probe, and distilled water was applied to each slide. After a coverslip was placed over the tissue and sealed with rubber cement, the slide was placed in a HYBrite™ machine (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Des Plaines, IL) where denaturation occurred at 75°C for 6min, followed by hybridization at 37°C for 16–18h. A rapid wash procedure was performed to remove unbound probe. Rubber cement was removed and slides were soaked for 60min at ambient temperature in a 70ml of solution of sodium chloride, sodium citrate and non-ionic detergent (2× SSC 0.1 NP40, pH 7–7.5). Next, coverslips were removed and slides were soaked for 2min in 70ml of 2× SSC 0.1 NP40 heated to 73°C. After slides were air-dried in darkness, 10?l of DAPI II counterstain was applied and a new coverslip was placed over the target area. Newly assayed slides were stored at ?20°C until scoring.   2.4 FISH scoring FISH assayed sections were scored at room temperature using the 40× and 100× oil objectives on a Zeiss Axioskope 2 (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a triple bandpass filter set (DAPI/Green/Orange V.2, Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Des Plaines, IL). Image capture was done using a color digital Axiocam 412-312 (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), and the software Openlab version 4.0.3 (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Criteria for scoring were established before performing FISH assays. In other FISH studies, the cutoff commonly used is 5% (5 cells with translocation out of 100 cells) [16–21]. However, the samples in this study had fewer readable cells, thus the cutoff was more conservative. Cases were classified as translocation-positive if more than 30% of cells showed abnormal signal patterns. For each sample, a minimum of 25 non-overlapping lymphocytes with complete FISH signals were scored; samples with fewer than 25 readable cells were not classified. A complete FISH signal was defined as one that included the full set of orange, green or fusion signals expected in a positive or negative cell; therefore we did not score lymphocytes with truncated nuclei and incomplete signals, or overlapping cells with signals that could not be differentiated. In addition, the strength of both the orange and green FISH signals had to be adequate to distinguish separate signals from fusion signals. The appearance and quality of FISH signals varied depending on the source of the tissue, the adequacy and type of sample fixation, and the overall quality of the tissue section. Samples in which the quality of the sample or the strength of the FISH signals were inadequate to reliably identify positive cells (i.e. samples that did not include at least 25 cells that could be scored) were classified as unreadable for the assay. Cases that were unreadable for the IGH assay (n =64) were automatically classified as unreadable for t(14;18). Cells other than lymphocytes, for example, epithelial or connective tissue cells in biopsies from extranodal sites, were not scored. Clonal evolution may result in both positive and negative neoplastic clones within a single tumor, and the distribution and clustering of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lymphocytes may vary depending on the tumor site and NHL subtype; therefore, each section was examined in its entirety for positive lymphocytes before being classified as translocation-negative. Non-neoplastic lymphocytes, which were present in all samples, served as internal negative controls.  t(14;18) assays were scored by two investigators (C.C. and J.S.). Concordance between the independent scores was 72% (121/169), including 9 cases that were classified as unreadable by both scorers. Discordant cases included sections that were classified as unreadable by only one scorer (26 cases). Discordant cases were subsequently reviewed and assigned a consensus score when possible, resulting in 152 successfully classified cases.   2.5 bcl-2 expression bcl-2 immunostaining was performed on paraffin sections from 229 FARM study cases using a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 124; Dako) corresponding to bcl-2 amino acids 41–54 (Dako Denmark A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). Cases were classified as bcl-2 positive if more than 20% of cells showed cytoplasmic staining. Twenty-one samples that were inadequate for scoring were classified as missing for bcl-2 expression. Scoring was performed by two investigators (W.Y.H. and J.S.). Independent scores were concordant for 92% of the cases assayed (191/208).   2.6 Data analysis FISH data were entered into an Access database (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Univariate analyses were performed based on data from 227 cases with complete FISH, PCR, and immunostaining data using SAS® version 9.1 [22]. The distribution of cases according to t(14;18) and bcl-2 expression was determined by WHO subtype, and t(14;18)-FISH assay results were compared with results of previous t(14;18)-PCR assays run on the same samples.

1673,S0046-8177(16)00080-0,"Clinicopathological analysis of a case series of peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified, of lymphoepithelioid variant (Lennert's lymphoma). A Central European single-center study—reply","Nodal PTCL-NOS is a very heterogeneous group of diseases. Several specific entities apart from nodal EBV+ cytotoxic PTCL have been identified. These include the lymphoepithelioid variant (Lennert lymphoma), T-zone variant, follicular variant (often with a follicular helper T cell [TFH] phenotype), and disease of the TFH phenotype [5]. Gafencu et al reported a series of Central European patients with Lennert lymphoma. These cases characteristically featured clusters of epithelioid histiocytes and small lymphoid cells, which were (predominantly) CD8+, exhibited a non-activated cytotoxic phenotype (ie, a TIA1+ and granzyme B? phenotype), and lacked PD1 (a TFH marker). Of note, no cases exhibited EBV infection, and the clinical outcomes were excellent. The observations of Gafencu et al are consistent with those of previous reports suggesting that most Lennert lymphomas express CD8 with rare exceptions [6,7]. Although Lennert lymphoma patients usually enjoy favorable prognoses, CD8+EBV+ Lennert lymphoma exhibits aggressive clinical behavior [8]. Thus, as Gafencu et al conclude, EBV infection rather than expression of cytotoxic molecules, may be the key factor influencing the survival of patients with PTCL of the Lennert type. Taken together, the data suggest that the nodal cytotoxic molecule+PTCL form of lymphoma may in fact be heterogeneous in terms of histology, EBV association, and prognosis."

1698,S0046-8177(16)00079-4,"Clinicopathological analysis of a case series of peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified, of lymphoepithelioid variant (Lennert's lymphoma). A Central European single-center study","Most of our cases show EBV negativity, as opposed to series of other cases [1–2]. For example, the previously mentioned study of Jeon et al [1] showed that EBV positivity, combined with a predominantly CD8+ phenotype, constitutes an overall more aggressive entity. Also, the study of Geissinger et al [2], demonstrated that Lennert's lymphoma may originate from cytotoxic T cells, in contrast to earlier statements [3]. Our case series of Lennert's lymphoma include 6 cases (2 women and 4 men) from the Ion Chiricut? Oncology Institute in Cluj Napoca, Romania, dating from 1987 until 2014. Lymph node biopsies were obtained from all patients, and staging was determined afterwards. For each patient, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and IPI were determined. All patients except one received 6 courses of the standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) regimen [4]. The follow-up was done by regular check-ups every 6 months for the first 2 years, then annually. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) included CD3, CD4, CD8, PD1, TIA1, Granzyme B, CD15, CD20, CD21, CD30 and Epstein–Barr status by Epstein–Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization, as recommended by international guidelines [5]. We evaluated mainly the percentage of small and large lymphoid cells that exhibited a positive reaction to the aforementioned procedure. We analyzed the percentage of epithelioid histiocytes, small lymphoid cells, large cells per high-power field and bi-nucleated Reed-Sternberg–like cells, plasma cells present and their morphology. The vascularity of the specimen was assessed as well. Our patients' lymphoma was in an advanced stage at the initial presentation, being stage III-IV in 5 out of 6 cases. As previously reported, our cases displayed lymphocytes of both CD4+ and CD8+ origin, and the cytotoxic cells seem to be of an inactivated phenotype, displaying TIA positivity and granzyme B negativity."

In addition, patient had increasing shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Physical exam demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy. Chest exam revealed a purple plaque like lesion on the right side of the chest. Lung and cardiovascular exam were benign. Patient's abdomen was distended and tender to palpation with positive fluid wave. Pitting edema was identified on lower extremities. Patient had a low grade temperature of 38.3°C with a heart rate of 122 and blood pressure 114/81 with a respiratory rate of 20 and oxygen saturation of 99% (on room air). Ultrasound of abdomen was done showing large amount of ascites. Cytological evaluation of the fluid showed malignant cells by cytology. CT abdomen and pelvis showed thickening and adjacent fat stranding of gastric antrum and proximal duodenum. EGD showed a large exophytic ulcerative friable mass measuring 3.0cm×2.0cm at lesser curvature of stomach. This mass was biopsied and diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK negative. Bone marrow biopsy didn't show any evidence of involvement by the lymphoma. The patient was also found to be HIV positive confirmed by Western blot with CD4 cell count of 141. Patient was then referred to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for further management. At Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, the outside slides of the gastric mass biopsy were reviewed, additional immunohistochemical stains were performed, and a diagnosis of extracavitary/solid variant of primary effusion lymphoma was made. Additionally, a punch biopsy of the right flank interior skin lesion was performed which revealed Kaposi sarcoma. "

He had an uncomplicated course with the exception of mild classic chronic GVHD of skin treated with topical steroids. Eleven months after HCT, he was off immunosuppression and receiving his vaccinations per our institutions protocol when he presented to clinic with dry cough, dyspnea, and oxygen saturations in mid 60% on room air. A chest CT demonstrated significant multifocal nodular opacities and ground glass in all lung fields (figure 1) as well as enlargement of axilla, sub pectoral and mediastinal lymph nodes. He underwent a non-diagnostic bronchoscopy followed by VATS left upper lobe and left lower lobe wedge resections. The pathology revealed acute organizing fibrinous pneumonitis (AFOP) (figure 2). He was intubated in the intensive care unit for 2 days after VATS wedge resection procedure. Therapy for AFOP was initiated methylprednisolone 1000mg daily in divided doses along with tacrolimus. Several days later etanercept 25mg SQ twice weekly was initiated because patient was not improving his oxygenation. He received a total of 8 doses of etanercept. His recovery was complicated by prolonged pneumothorax and pneumomediastium requiring a pigtail catheter. He returned to the operating room for decortication, mechanical pleurodesis and chest tube placement. Eight days postoperatively the chest tube was removed. He was weaned of oxygen in seven days. Repeat chest CT demonstrated improved multifocal airspace disease (figure 1) and he is still without oxygen as of September 2014. "
1706,S0165-5728(09)00404-4,An atypical case of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease revealed as a late cerebral lymphoma," 2 Case report We report such a patient, in whom XLP disease was revealed after presentation with a primitive B-cell cerebral lymphoma: a 41-year-old male presented with a 4-week history of asthenia, laryngitis, and odynophagia. Clinical examination revealed inguinal, axillary and occipital centimetric lymphadenopathies. Blood tests disclosed major lymphocytosis (25,000/mm3) with mononucleosis syndrome and significant hepatitis, with a 10-fold increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. His clinical and biological symptoms, except for lymphocytosis, improved within 2weeks, without any treatment. However, he was admitted to our institution 2weeks later because of febrile confusion. Examination revealed left facial paralysis and horizontal diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral lesions involving the basal ganglia and related structures (Fig. 1A,B), with massive edema precluding lumbar puncture. Laboratory findings (Table 1 ) confirmed lymphocytosis (15,000/mm3) with 82% of large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Hemoglobin was 15g/dL and platelet count was 233,000/mm3. Bone marrow aspiration showed 40% LGL. The lymphocyte immunophenotype was: LGL; CD3+, CD8+, TCR??+, HLADR+, CD38, with an absence of CD19+, CD20+ B-cells. Molecular analysis of LGL showed an oligoclonal profile. C-reactive protein was 3mg/L, and electrophoresis of serum proteins initially showed 8.2g/L of gammaglobulins, with a monoclonal IgG-? component (Fig. 1E). Human immunodeficiency virus, EBV, and cytomegalovirus serologies were negative, as was P24 antigenemia. Serology for Toxoplasma gondii suggested a recent infection, with IgM positivity and large amounts of IgG. This was confirmed 3weeks later by a control test. Clinical examination showed no lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. A thoraco-abdomino-pelvic scan was normal, and there was no evidence of lymphoma from the bone marrow biopsy. Treatment for toxoplasmosis was started with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, with no improvement. A stereotaxic biopsy was then performed and revealed a large B-cell cerebral lymphoma (Fig. 1C). Cytoplasmic staining for the EBV-specific LMP-1 protein was positive (Fig. 1D). After chemotherapy with high-dose intravenous methotrexate (without anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibody) associated with cerebral radiotherapy, the disease improved and the patient achieved complete remission. Two years after diagnosis, the patient remained in remission. A systematic blood work-up disclosed a-gamma-globulinemia (Fig. 1F). Blood LGL expansion was still present, with no CD19+, CD20+ B-cells, and no NKT cells (phenotypically characterized by the invariant TCR ?/? chain composed of the gene segments V?24-V?11). Repeated EBV serology and blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative. These results suggested an immunodeficiency disease, which was corroborated by familial genetic screening (Fig. 2 ). The exclusive male distribution and the clinical considerations (two possible fatal EBV infections at an early age), were in accordance with an XLP disease. This was confirmed by genetic study, which revealed a C462T mutation (R55X) in the SH2D1A gene (XLP-1). Intravenous (iv) Ig substitution was started because of the presence of a-gamma-globulinemia. Three years later, the patient's lymphoma was still in complete remission, and he had not presented with any infectious diseases. "

Typically, the more common T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) presents as a mediastinal mass in young patients. In contrast, B-LBL has a more varied presentation, most often presenting in extramediastinal locations. Both T-LBL and B-LBL with oral cavity involvement are rare, and to date there have been no cases of B-LBL presenting as an oral mass. Here, we report here the first intraoral case of B-LBL."
1711,S2214-0271(16)30046-X,B-cell lymphoma of the pericardium presenting with ventricular tachycardia with a successful catheter ablation," Introduction Cardiac lymphoma is a rare malignancy of the myocardium and/or pericardium and is difficult to detect and diagnose. A diagnosis of a primary and secondary cardiac lymphoma is often made with ventricular tachycardia (VT) as a first symptom. 1–3  This case report illustrates a unique presentation of cardiac lymphoma.  Case report A 62-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure secondary to nonischemic cardiomyopathy, complete atrioventricular block, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation developed an electrical storm related to an incessant VT refractory to amiodarone and mexiletine. He then underwent an electrophysiological study and catheter ablation of the VT. The clinical VT was easily induced by ventricular extrastimulation from the right ventricle (RV), and exhibited a left bundle branch block and left superior axis QRS morphology with a QS pattern in the inferior leads and a cycle length of 480 ms ( Figure 1). Activation mapping was performed with a 7.5 French, 3.5-mm-tip irrigated ablation catheter (Navistar ThermoCool; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA), revealing a centrifugal activation pattern from the posterobasal septum in the RV, where a presystolic ventricular activation was recorded. Rapid pacing at this site revealed classic entrainment with a minimal fusion and long post-pacing interval (545 ms) (Figure 1). A couple of irrigated radiofrequency applications delivered at this endocardial site did not interrupt the VT. An attempt to obtain a subxiphoidal pericardial access was then made, but it failed because of a dense pericardial adhesion. Later, a cardiovascular surgeon was consulted to create a pericardial window. Because the subxiphoidal pericardial window was not large enough for epicardial mapping of the VT, a median sternotomy was performed. The entire heart was encircled with very thick pericardial adhesions, producing constriction. After meticulous dissection, the epicardial RV could be mapped. Because the VT had become noninducible at this point, substrate mapping was performed, revealing a huge scar involving the entire epicardial RV containing several isolated diastolic potentials in the inferior wall ( Figure 2). After an angiogram of the right coronary artery confirmed a safe distance from the right coronary artery, several irrigated radiofrequency applications targeting the isolated diastolic potentials were delivered, resulting in their elimination (Figure 2). Following this, the chest was closed. No complications occurred. A histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical stains of the pericardium revealed a large B-cell lymphoma, germinal center type, that had infiltrated into the soft tissue and skeletal muscle ( Figure 3). Chest computed tomography revealed mediastinal, internal mammary, and cardiophrenic adenopathy. Chemotherapy was abandoned because the patient was unlikely to tolerate it. Although no VTs recurred on amiodarone 200 mg daily, the patient died of congestive heart failure a month later.  "

Briefly, cases comprise patients newly diagnosed with non-HIV associated lymphoma aged 18–64 years between 1998 and 2001 while resident in North or Southwest England. All diagnoses were pathologically reviewed and coded to the World Health Organization's International Classification for Oncology version 3 [32]. One control per case, matched on sex and date-of-birth, was randomly selected from population registers. Subjects were asked to consent to interview, allow access to their medical records and to collection and analysis of biological samples. A total of 912 (75%) lymphoma cases and 919 (71%) controls were interviewed, and among interviewees, DNA was available for 836 (92%) cases and 827 (90%) controls. The current investigation included 471 Caucasian cases (236 females, 235 males; mean age at diagnoses 53.2 years SD=8.51) with a confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL (n =267) or FL (n =204) and 468 controls. These two subtypes comprised 79% of NHL cases recruited into our study. The study was conducted with the approval of the UK Multi-Regional Ethical Committee and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.   2.2 Interview data At interview, participants were asked about the colour of their eyes, their untanned skin colour, the colour of their hair when they were 5 years old, and whether they had sunburn which caused discomfort for a day or more. To estimate sun exposure during the summer, interviewees were asked to recall the number of daylight hours spent outdoors in the summer months and whether they spent less than 1h; 1–2h; 3–4h; or 5h or more outdoors per day during working or school time and during their leisure time at 5 years prior to diagnosis/reference date. Total number of hours per day spent outdoors was estimated by summing the midpoints of the reported hour categories across working and non-working time, and was grouped into less than 4; or 4 or more hours per day outdoors.   2.3 DNA extraction and genotyping Following extraction and quantification of DNA from peripheral blood samples using the Nucleon BACC Kit, MC1R genotypes were determined by direct sequencing by DxS Ltd. (UK) and were manually checked for quality control purposes. The analyses were restricted to the nine most common variants R151C, R160W, D294H, V60L, D84E, V92M, R163Q, R142H and I155T seen in Caucasian populations [33].   2.4 MC1R genotype groups MC1R genotype groups were derived according to which polymorphisms related to skin and hair colour. Since the MC1R variants are rare, a combinatorial, rather than statistical, approach was taken to derive these MC1R genotype groups that reflected the red hair colour phenotype. Each polymorphism was coded as an ordinal variable based on the number of copies of the minor allele. Logistic regression modelling was used to assess how SNPs influenced having red hair compared to not having red hair. All models included cases and controls to maximise power. The regression parameter beta for each SNP referred to the change in log odds of red hair per copy of the minor allele. Similar analyses were also conducted for having fair skin compared to not having fair skin. MC1R polymorphisms were combined in a genotype group to reflect the degree of association with red hair colour; the strongest association being for those individuals who were compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for the variants associated with red hair colour.   2.5 Statistical analysis Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for an unmatched analysis using unconditional regression [34]. All risk estimates were adjusted for age, sex and region. Tests for trend and for interaction were conducted using the likelihood ratio test. Due to the rarity of homozygous carriers of the minor allele, risk estimates for carriers compared to non-carriers of the minor allele are presented. Findings were presented including data on all nine MC1R SNPs; analyses which excluded the few SNPs not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium gave similar risk estimates to those reported. All analyses were performed using Stata [35].  "

She was initially found to have hematuria at an outside institution and was treated empirically for pyelonephritis. The back pain worsened, however, and she later presented with distal lower extremity paresthesias and difficulty ambulating. She was discharged on a 5day course of prednisone with no improvement. Paresthesias progressed to the groin and perineum, and due to concern for Guillain–Barré syndrome, she was subsequently referred to our institution. Her neurologic examination was consistent with a sensory level at T10 on the right side and T9 on the left, with a positive Babinski sign. She also had mild proximal lower extremity weakness. MRI revealed an epidural lesion concerning for abscess or tumor centered at T10, displacing the spinal cord to the right (Fig. 1 ). The patient underwent an emergent T9–T10 laminectomy with T8–T11 instrumentation and resection of the epidural mass. Pathology was consistent with a diagnosis of CHL (Fig. 2 ). Positron emission tomography/CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass and paratracheal lymphadenopathy (Fig. 3 ). The patient was started on adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine with plans for eventual radiation to the mediastinum and spine. Her post-operative course was complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli and extensive deep vein thrombi, requiring anticoagulation.

The patient complained of fatigue and night sweats over the prior week. The further examination was unremarkable with no other skin findings or palpable lymphadenopathy. Skin biopsy of the left forearm showed a diffuse and nodular lymphohistiocytic and granulomatous infiltrate in the superficial and the reticular dermis centered around skin appendages and blood vessels (angiocentricity) extending in subcutaneous adipose tissue (Fig 2 , A and B). Repeat biopsy 1 month later found a thinned epidermis with impending ulcer with extensive area of necrosis, lymphocyte exocytosis, basal vacuolization, and Civatte bodies (Fig 2, C). The dermis showed diffuse sheets of monotonous medium-sized cells with hyperchromatic nuclei that extended into the epidermis and included numerous (about 25%) large atypical lymphocytes (Fig 2, D). The infiltrate consisted of predominantly T cells and some CD20+ B cells (Fig 3 ). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNAs (EBER) were positive in approximately 75% of the infiltrate. The atypical lymphocytes stained positively with CD2 and CD3 and exhibited loss of CD7 expression. Although there were many CD4 (about 75%) and fewer CD8 (about 25%) cells, the precise phenotype of the neoplastic cells was difficult to ascertain because of the numerous admixed reactive T cells. BF-1 was positive in about 75% of cells. LCA, TIA-1, and granzyme were positive in 50% of cells. CD5 highlighted background T cells. Ki-67 stained about 50% of the infiltrate. CD30 stained about 30% of the cells. FOXP3 and CD123 stained about 10% of cells. CD56 and CD34 were negative and CD57 stained rare cells. Southern blot did not detect T-cell receptor (TCR)-? chain rearrangement in the sample from the left forearm, and TCR-? chain rearrangement was indeterminate with polymerase chain reaction in the repeat biopsy owing to an inhibitor preventing amplification. EBV serology found significant elevation of VCA IgG antibody (>750 U/mL) and EBV nuclear antigen IgG (537 U/mL). Bone marrow examination was negative for lymphoma involvement. Further evaluation and subsequent staging included a positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan, which found increased uptake in the left calf at the place of the original tumor as well as in tonsils and spleen (Fig 4 ). Enlarged lymph nodes were found in the cervical regions bilaterally; left superior mediastinum; and the retroperitoneal, splenic, and bilateral inguinal regions. An ear, nose, and throat examination was not performed but patient did not exhibit any of those symptoms. Initially, after diagnosis, he was treated with radiation therapy to the lesion on his left leg and arm, and R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone, plus rituximab). After six cycles of R-CHOP, he exhibited complete clinical remission. However, within 6 months, his disease recurred with subcutaneous nodules on his left chest wall, left lateral thigh, and the right scrotum. He was restarted on R-ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide plus rituximab) for 3 cycles. His disease progressed despite initiation of intrathecal chemotherapy with depocyt, carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan, and autologous stem cell transplant.

1757,S2210-2612(16)30473-4,Plasmablastic lymphoma: oral presentation in patient suffering from osteradionecrosis of the jaw," 2 Presentation of case M. S., 64 years old, had a primitive right oropharyngeal tumour ranked T3N1M0, for which he was treated by a surgery associated with radio-chemotherapy. This patient had a smoking and alcoholism background, and a gastro oesophageal reflux disease. In December 2008, he had an initial dental consultation before radiotherapy (Fig. 1 ). The field of irradiation included the whole maxillary and the bilateral posterior mandibular areas up to the second premolars. Consequently teeth number 37/38/47/48 were extracted and the healing was acquired before the radiotherapy began. A prevention of radio-induced tooth decay was instaured with a daily local fluoridation. In May 2009, the patient came back for a routine check. He no long wore his fluoridation mouthguard. Consequently we observed teeth decay. Furthermore, an area of bone exposition (3mm large, 17mm long) was found on the mandibulary left molar area. Bone sequestra were removed. We insisted on the necessity of teeth brushing and daily fluoride gel application. The patient came in for regular check-ups and three months later we noted a slow but progressive epithelialization on the necrotic area. Due to the remoteness of his home he was sent back to his treating dentist for dental follow-up and prosthetic rehabilitation. In December 2010, the patient developed a cancer recurrence on the soft palate and right tonsil, successfully treated by a single surgery. In May 2011, the patient came back at the request of his radiotherapist. As he was not compliant with oral hygiene and fluoride gel application, all the remaining teeth presented important decays. Consequently the 21 remaining teeth were removed under general anesthesia and Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (3g per day, during 10day) was prescribed. Postoperatively the healing was on the good way. Consequently the patient was sent to his treating dentist to perform regular control. In October 2011, the patient presented an osteoradionecrosis with 3 bone exposure areas: one (2mm) facing the lower premolar area, one (3mm) on the right retromolar process and another one on the top right molar area. A bone milling until having a bone bleeding was performed, the patient was treated with antibiotics (Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid 3g per day, during three weeks) and local cleaning with chlorhexidine. The patient was followed every 2 months all along the year 2012. At each time we noticed a very slow but favourable cicatrisation, despite the persistence of a small bone exposure on the right tuber maxillae (4mm). During the same period the patient was examinated by both his surgeon and radiotherapist, who found no clinical or biological abnormality. On February 2013, an asymptomatic ulceration (diameter 1.5cm) with an erythematous border was observed on the right maxillary tuberosity. The patient was seen with a dental panoramic x-ray images and a cone beam witch highlighted a bone necrosis (Fig. 2 ). Due to the persistence of the ulceration, a biopsy was performed (Fig. 3 ). The pathology results revealed a malpighian mucosa with a lymphomatic proliferation, made of large cells, some with a plasmocytoid aspect, an abundant cytoplasm, eccentrically placed nuclei, hypertrophic nucleoli, and hindwings chromatin (Fig. 4 ). The immunohistochemistry review was negative for the CD 20, CD 10, BCL 2 and CD 30 cells, but found positive CD 79 cells and many tumoral positive CD 38 cells. The histological type was in favour of a plasmablastic lymphoma. A second examination and a research of Eptsein Barr Virus were performed. In situ hybridation made with EBER probe points revealed the presence of EBV transcript in every lymphomatics cells (Fig. 5 ). Considering this diagnosis, the patient was sent to the haematologist. Unfortunately the patient died six months after diagnosis. "

Physical examination revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever (39°C) and a uterus equivalent to 25 weeks' gestation. Laboratory evaluation revealed a microcytic anaemia with haematocrit and haemoglobin values of 21% and 4.3 mmol/l respectively, accompanied by an elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (496 iu/l), while alkaline phosphatase was normal (120 iu/l). Toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, listeria serology, hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency tests were all negative. Blood and urine cultures were also negative. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed an enlarged spleen and liver and prominent hepatic hilar nodes, with no para-aortic lymphadenopathy. Obstetric ultrasonography showed a single, viable and well-developed fetus. Chest X-ray showed mild pleural effusions. On her second day in hospital her temperature rose, accompanied by a cough and dyspnea, so the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Intravenous (iv) antibiotic treatment was started with erythromycin 1 g, twice daily, ceftazidime 1 g, three times daily and intramuscular clindamycin 600 mg, twice daily. The situation remained stable and two days later a cervical lymph node biopsy, was reported to be a high grade diffuse NHL, B-lymphocytic type. A bone marrow biopsy showed no lymphomatous involvement. Because of the aggressive nature of this malignancy the decision was made to start treatment immediately. After correction of the anaemia with blood transfusions, combination chemotherapy was given as first-line treatment. The regime was the following: cyclophosphamide 1200 mg iv once a day for five days, prednisolone 20 mg iv twice daily for five days, mitoxanthrone 20 mg iv once a day for five days and vincristine 2 mg iv once a day on the first and the fifth days. A good initial response was observed. Three weeks later a second course of chemotherapy was given. This comprised single doses of 2 mg vincristine iv and 1200 mg cyclophosphamide iv on the first day, and once daily doses of 10 mg mitoxanthrone iv and 20 mg dexamethasone iv for two days. The pregnancy continued uneventfully up to 31 weeks, when an emergency caesarean section was performed because of a low biophysical profile score with an abnormal cardiotocogram (CTG). The baby was a viable male weighing 1700 g, with Apgar scores of 6 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min. A true knot was found during the caesarean section. There was no evidence of haematological suppression in the neonate. An acute respiratory distress syndrome developed due to prematurity. The baby did well in the Neonatal Unit. On the third postoperative day the mother presented fever and respiratory distress. A computerized tomography (CT) of the chest showed a `mass' in the base of the right lung, while a percutaneous liver biopsy showed lymphomatous involvement, confirming stage IVB disease. A new combination chemotherapy with ifosfamide 2500 mg iv once a day together with mesna 500 mg iv four times daily for four days, etoposide 125 mg iv once a day for four days and mitoxanthrone 10 mg iv once a day for the first two days was given to the patient and the `mass' in the right lung resolved. The same chemotherapy was repeated twice at three-weekly intervals. After a 30-day response period, paralysis developed and a following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral involvement. The patient was transferred to a specialist haematology Unit. However, despite high-dose chemotherapy, she died seven months later from disseminated disease. "
1782,S0046-8177(15)00480-3,Dyspoietic changes associated with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma are not a manifestation of a myelodysplastic syndrome: analysis of 25 patients," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Study group We searched the files of the Department of Hematopathology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Departments of Pathology at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Columbia University Medical Center for cases diagnosed with HSTCL between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2014. Data were collected according to protocols approved by the institutional review boards of all institutions. The diagnosis of HSTCL was based on criteria in the WHO classification [7]. Clinical data were collected by review of the medical records.   2.2 Histopathologic assessment Bone marrow specimens obtained at initial diagnosis were evaluated. Hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides of core and/or clot specimens, with corresponding Wright-Giemsa–stained aspirate smears and/or touch imprints, were reviewed. An iron stain was performed on aspirate smears to assess storage iron as well as the presence of ring sideroblasts.   2.3 Assessment of dyspoiesis Assessment of dyspoiesis was performed using bone marrow core biopsy and/or clot specimens for megakaryocytic lineage, and bone marrow aspirate smears and/or touch imprints for myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic lineages. The possibility of an associated MDS was assessed following parameters recommended by the WHO [6]. All hematopoietic cell lineages were assessed for morphologic features of dyspoiesis and scored as 0-3+ (0; no dysplasia, 1+, dyspoiesis present <5% of cells: 2+, dyspoiesis present <10% of cells; 3+, dyspoiesis present ?10% of cells).   2.4 Immunophenotypic analysis The methods used for immunohistochemical studies and flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis have been reported elsewhere [8]. The tumor burden was semiquantified based on CD3 immunohistochemistry performed on bone marrow core biopsy and/or clot specimens [8,9].   2.5 Cytogenetic analysis Conventional chromosomal analysis was performed on G-banded metaphases on bone marrow aspirate specimens as described previously [10]. All karyotypes were written based on the 2013 International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature [11]. A karyotype was considered as “complex” when at least 3 abnormalities were identified [12]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed using air-dried slides of bone marrow smears or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections on a subset of cases to assess for trisomy 8, using a CEP8 probe (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). A total of 200 interphases were analyzed. The cutoff for a positive result of trisomy 8 established in our laboratory is 2.4%. Combined morphologic and FISH analysis was performed as described previously [13] with minor modifications. In brief, morphologic evaluation and image capture of bone marrow aspirate smears stained with Wright-Giemsa were performed through a bright-field microscope (×100 objective). Smears were then destained using 1% acid alcohol (1% HCl in 70% ethanol), followed by the treatment with protease II (Abbott Molecular/Vysis) and hybridization with a fluorescently labeled probe CEP8. Target cell populations (with Wright-Giemsa stain) were matched through a fluorescent microscope and the corresponding fluorescence images were taken (×100 objective).   2.6 Molecular testing for T-cell receptor gene rearrangements The T-cell receptor (TCR) ? chain was assessed by using polymerase chain reaction–based methods on DNA extracted from bone marrow aspirate or tissue biopsy specimens. At our institution, a mixture of 4 family-specific, multicolored, fluorescently labeled variable region primers and 4 unlabeled joining primers was used in a multiplex assay as has been described [14]. The TCR ? and immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes were assessed in a subset of cases. The referral cases were assessed at other laboratories using TCR ? and/or ? gene rearrangement assays by a variety of methods.   2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA). Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of initial diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the date of initial diagnosis to the date of progressive disease, relapse, or death. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared using the log-rank test. Student t test was used for the analysis between 2 groups. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.  "
1799,S1047-2797(10)00020-7,Meta-Analysis and Causal Inference: A Case Study of Benzene and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma," Background  Prior Reviews and Meta-Analyses on Benzene and NHL The conclusions found in the review by Smith et al. (1) and in the meta-analysis by Steinmaus et al. (2) do not exist in a scientific vacuum. At least 16 other reviews and two additional meta-analyses were published in the past 10 years, from 1999 through 2008 (9–26), reflecting the intense interest in the benzene and NHL relationship as well as in the rapid rise in NHL incidence that remains largely unexplained. The conclusions of these earlier evidentiary assessments are presented in Table 1 . It is fair to say that, prior to 2008, a broad consensus existed, falling far short of declaring a causal link between benzene and NHL. Two recent reviews concluded that the evidence on causation was not sufficient (19, 24). For some reviewers, the direction of the relationship has not been established, putting at risk the notion that NHL and benzene are associated with one another, much less causally associated (21, 25). National Cancer Institute investigators, in a well-respected textbook on cancer epidemiology published in 2006, devoted a single sentence to benzene in their chapter on NHL. They opined that benzene has not been shown to have a large role in lymphoma risk (23). And, as noted earlier, the 2007 review by Smith et al. concludes only that an association exists, a conclusion falling far short of causation. That leaves the meta-analysis by Steinmaus et al. as the only reasonably systematic evidentiary assessment that attempts to move the scientific community from association to causation on the question of benzene and NHL. The two earlier meta-analyses of worker populations concluded that workers were not at increased risk for NHL from benzene exposure (10, 20). It follows that the use of meta-analysis is the most likely source of the causal claim regarding benzene and NHL, rather than new scientific evidence or conclusions from earlier assessments. Indeed, Steinmaus et al. noted that their primary purpose was to use meta-analysis to evaluate causal inference. A careful look at the role that meta-analysis plays in causal inference is, therefore, critically important.   Meta-Analysis and Causal Inference The primary role of meta-analysis in occupational epidemiology, indeed, in epidemiology in general, is not causal inference per se. The popular “Modern Epidemiology” methods textbook, for example, emphasizes that meta-analysis has two roles: first, to summarize results (a synthetic goal), and second, to estimate or identify differences among study-specific estimates of effect (an analytic goal) (27). Causal inference is another matter altogether. As Greenland notes, one should be aware of the limitations of meta-analysis; causal explanations are outside its realm (27). Causal inference is a much broader methodological concern, involving a systematic narrative review, an assessment of the extent to which the causal hypothesis of interest has been adequately tested, including but not limited to concerns about confounding and bias, as well as an assessment in terms of the full list of relevant causal criteria (or considerations): strength, consistency, dose-response, biological plausibility, specificity, temporality, experimental evidence, coherence, and analogy (28). Meta-analysis is not irrelevant to causal inference; it can assess publication bias. Meta-analysis can increase the precision of estimates of effect, including the precision of dose-response relationships, and it provides an assessment of consistency. However, when assessing consistency, the meta-analyst must be very careful (29). The synthetic (summarization) role of meta-analysis can give a false impression of consistency, especially if important differences in individual studies are not taken into account (27). Meta-analysis can also increase the precision of the overall summary estimate of effect and the precision of the dose-response relationship. But we should keep in mind the fact that the assessment of strength and of dose-response begins but does not end with precision. The assessment of strength (as a causal consideration) primarily involves the numerical magnitude of the estimate rather than its precision per se. The larger the magnitude (for the same precision), the less likely alternative hypotheses (confounders and the like) can explain the findings. Similarly, it is not the precision per se of the dose-response relationship that matters most to causal analysis but rather the pattern, whether estimates of effect increase with increasing exposure, that is, the manner in which these patterns reveal themselves. Increased precision is not irrelevant to causal inference, but in the end what matters most are the magnitude of the effect estimate and the pattern of the dose-response relationship. Put another way, meta-analysis does not, by itself, provide an assessment of strength or dose-response. These considerations are assessed along with biological plausibility, specificity, and the rest once the meta-analysis is complete. Of all the causal criteria (or considerations), only consistency can be satisfied by meta-analysis.   Causal Claims in Meta-Analyses of Occupational Epidemiology Studies To what extent are causal claims made in the practice of meta-analysis? To answer this question, a search of PubMed was undertaken, using terms “meta-analysis, occupational” with limits set: title/abstract, published in the past 5 years. Sixty-three English-language publications met these requirements (2, 30–91); 20 were eliminated because they summarized randomized clinical trials or intervention studies. ?   ? References 31, 32, 34, 36, 40, 41, 55, 65, 66, 68, 71, 73, 76, 79, 82, 83, 86–89.  Of the remaining 42 meta-analyses, only six mentioned causality in the abstract. Of these, only one—Steinmaus et al. (2)—made a causal claim. The remaining five suggested that the evidence was insufficient to support causation or that causality remained unanswered (35, 53, 61, 62, 91). It is important to point out that many—a large majority—of the meta-analyses revealed positive results, that is, consistent and statistically significant increases in risk. However, the most common (and appropriate) interpretation of these results was that the meta-analytical results revealed evidence of an association.  "

1817,S0344-0338(15)30012-1,Unique presentation of a plasmablastic lymphoma superficially involving the entire large bowel," 2 Case description In August 2013 a 72 year-old man was referred to the Gastroenterology Department of Arcispedale S. Maria Nuova, Reggio Emilia (Italy) because of severe diarrhea, malaise and rectal bleeding. The patient was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) three months earlier when he started having intestinal symptoms with bloody diarrhea and was treated with topical and oral steroids with temporary improvement of the symptoms. His past medical history was unremarkable. In August a repeated colonoscopy (Fig. 1 ) revealed an intense pancolitis characterized by a diffusely hemorrhagic and granular mucosa with multiple deep ulcers surrounding pseudopolyps. Due to a stricture of the lumen, the endoscopic procedure could not go beyond the transverse colon. Multiple mucosal biopsies showed marked glandular distortion with intense chronic lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrate together with cryptic abscesses. These histological features were consistent with an active UC. A magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) confirmed a diffuse large bowel wall thickening extending from the rectum to the descending colon, with no evidence of a clear-cut stenosis. Viral serology (EBV, HIV, CMV) and stool culture were negative. The peripheral blood exams were normal. Owing to the poor conditions, the patient required hospitalization and was initially treated with intravenous corticosteroids with no beneficial effect. Subsequently he received two infusions of infliximab and only a one-week course of azathioprine due to severe gastric azathioprine intolerance. Despite therapy, the clinical conditions progressively worsened with bloody diarrhea, fever and rapid weight loss. In November, a total proctocolectomy with ileostomy was performed. Macroscopically the surgical specimen (Fig. 2 ) revealed a diffusely granular mucosa with multiple linear ulcers and pseudopolyps associated with a variable, but diffuse thickening of the intestinal wall. There was no evidence of a definite tumor mass. Histological examination (Fig. 3 ) of the large bowel confirmed the UC mucosal alterations already identified in the previous biopsies. In addition, there were sheets of large cells with prominent nucleoli and an immunoblastic/plasmablastic morphology infiltrating in a band-like fashion mainly in the submucosa and only focally in the muscularis propria. Mucosal involvement by large, atypical cells was also focal and mainly confined to the ulcers. The neoplastic infiltrate involved the entire large bowel from cecum to rectum as demonstrated by extensive sampling. Immunohistochemically the atypical cells showed a plasma cell phenotype, positive for CD138 (clone [B-A38]/PD – Prediluted Ventana BenchMark) and IRF4/MUM1 ([MRQ-43]/PD), weakly positive for CD79alfa ([SP18]/PD) and negative for CD20 ([L26]/PD), PAX5 ([SP34]/PD), CD45 ([PD7/26/16+2B11]/PD), CD3 ([2GV6]/PD), CD2 ([LFA-2]/1:50, Novocastra), CD30 ([L26]/PD), ALK-1 ([ALK-01]/PD), CD56 ([123C3]/PD), EMA ([E29]/PD), CD34 ([QBend10]/PD), MPO ([Polyclonal rabbit]/1:4000, Dako), cytokeratin ([AE1/AE3/PCK26]/PD) and Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) ([13B10]/PD). The proliferation index, assessed by ki67/MIB1 staining, was approximately 70%. In situ hybridization (ISH) for Epstein–Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) was positive. A clonal IgH gene rearrangement was found. A diagnosis of PBL was finally made. A staging bone marrow biopsy was negative for neoplasia and a total body computed tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) showed no other site of disease. According to the Ann Arbor staging system the patient had stage IVA lymphoma, with a low/intermediate age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI), frail according to comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). He received two cycles of cyclophosphamide plus prednisone and six cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and prednisone. Local radiotherapy was performed. At 19 months from diagnosis, the patient is in complete remission and in good clinical conditions. "
1825,S0278-2391(14)00914-8,Primary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the sublingual gland: a case report," Case Presentation An 81-year-old male presented to our outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of swelling of the floor of the mouth. No medical history and no medication were identified. On intraoral examination, a fibrous and painless enlargement of the right sublingual gland was noted. No enlargement of the submandibular glands and no cervical lymphadenopathy were noted on extraoral examination. A CT scan showed a tumor-like image in the right side of the floor of the mouth. An MRI also revealed a mass in the right sublingual gland with the size of 25 mm x 15 mm x 18 mm. A tentative diagnosis of malignant tumor of the sublingual gland was made and the biopsy specimen revealed suspicion of malignant lymphoma. Subsequently, surgical removal of the right sublingual gland with surrounding tissue was performed as an initial treatment, as well as for confirming a definitive diagnosis. The surgical specimen was compatible with low-grade B-cell lymphoma of MALT type on histological evaluation. The patient was referred to the hematology department for further workup and treatment. According to the Ann Arbor staging system, this case was considered a stage IE MALT type lymphoma. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology indicates that if the non-gastric MALT lymphoma is stage I-II, then radiation therapy is preferred. However surgery may be considered for certain sites. This guideline also states that surgical excision for adequate diagnosis may be appropriate treatment for disease. Accordingly, no additional treatment was employed following surgery and the patient has been observed. After the surgical treatment, the patient continues to be free of any evidence of lymphoma. MALT lymphoma is commonly associated with preexisting autoimmune disease such as Sjögren's syndrome or with chronic immune stimulation such as Helicobacter pylori infection. However, this case was not associated with these diseases and the patient had no considerable medical history. "
1831,S2352-5126(16)30071-6,Intralesional rituximab for cutaneous manifestations of systemic B-cell lymphoma," Case report In August 2014, a 79-year-old man was sent to the dermatology department for evaluation of erythematous, infiltrated plaques on the scalp and frontotemporal regions evolving over a 6-month period. His medical history included a squamous cell carcinoma of the left scalp in 1990 treated by localized excision, left cervical lymph node dissection, and radiotherapy. In 2009, the patient presented to the dermatology department with an erythematous nodule on his forehead. Cutaneous biopsy found follicle center cutaneous B-cell lymphoma with immunohistochemistry profile positivity for CD20, CD79, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6. He had positive translocation (t[14:18]) on the cutaneous biopsy specimen. He then underwent systemic workup. The computed tomography scan found lymph nodes in the paravertebral area, around the aorta, and at the base of the mesenteric vessels. His bone marrow biopsy found the presence of lymphoma cells. Therefore, systemic follicle center non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed and successfully treated with 5 courses of R-CVP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone). He remained clinically stable on follow-up with complete regression of the cutaneous lesions until August 2014 when the new cutaneous lesions were reported. Cutaneous lesions resulting from his systemic lymphoma was the primary working diagnosis. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic with no general symptoms of fever, weight loss, or night sweats. His positron emission tomography scan, complete blood count, liver function tests, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal. He, therefore, had a quiescent systemic disease and no indication for chemotherapy. On physical examination, there was an erythematous infiltrated 4.2- × 3-cm plaque on the left scalp and 4 erythematous coalescent nodules on the left and right frontotemporal regions. There were no enlarged lymph nodes. We proceeded with a skin biopsy of the largest plaque. Histopathology found a dermal lymphocytic nodular infiltrate made of small to intermediate size cells with notched nucleus and the presence of dispersed large size cells. Immunohistochemistry profile showed positivity for CD79 and Bcl-2. A pathologist confirmed that the cellular architecture was of follicle center origin. Therefore, this information confirms the recurrence of cutaneous lesions of the patient's secondary follicle center B-cell lymphoma even though his systemic workup found no current active disease. After literature review and discussion with the patient and his hematologist-oncologist, we decided to treat the secondary CBCL with intralesional rituximab at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Our treatment regimen was based on the study for intralesional rituximab in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas by Gamo et al. 1  We followed their treatment protocol, and each cutaneous lesion was injected with 10 to 30 mg (10 mg in the small nodules and 30 mg in the large infiltrated plaque), 3 times a week every 4 weeks until resolution. One treatment cycle corresponds to 3 intralesional injections on week 1 and 3 weeks without treatment. After the first treatment cycle, all lesions had responded. Complete regression of the right frontotemporal lesions was noted after the first treatment cycle, the left frontotemporal lesions after the second, and the left scalp after the third cycle (Fig 1 ). We recorded no recurrence during treatment or during follow-up, which is currently at 12 months posttreatment. A total cumulative dose of 185 mg of rituximab was used. The treatment was well tolerated with only mild pain of short duration at the injection sites. Complete blood count, liver function tests, creatinine, and electrolytes remained normal during treatment and at follow-up. "

Ann Arbor Staging System was used to determine the disease status of the patients. Biopsy samples were re-evaluated according to the WHO classification. VEGF-A, VEGF-C, Cox-2, TSP-1, EBV-LMP-1 and Survivin were studied by immunohistochemistry. Originally, 177 cases with NHL including low and high grade lymphomas were evaluated for six parameters; each parameter was published in whole group [2–5]. In this study, 88 cases with DLBCL were evaluated for all of these six biologic parameters. Five-micron-thick sections were cut from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, dewaxed and hydrated. Usual immunohistochemical staining procedures were applied to the samples for every biological parameter. Sections were incubated with Survivin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. cat# sc-17779 Positive control: tonsil staining pattern: nuclear), TSP-1 (Thrombospondine-1: Novacastra Cat # NCL-TSP1 Positive control: placenta, staining pattern: cytoplasmic), VEGF-A (VEGF (A-20) Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. cat# sc-150 Positive control: tonsil, staining pattern: cytoplasmic), VEGF-C (VEGF-C Zymed Laboratories Inc. cat# 18-2255 Positive control: colon carcinoma, staining pattern: cytoplasmic), EBV-LMP1 (Epstein-Barr virus-latent membrane protein, Novacastra NCL-EBV-CS1- Positive control: Hodgkin disease, staining pattern: cytoplasmic), and Cox-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2 Novacastra NCL-COX-2 Positive control: Ulcerative colitis staining pattern: H score:). Cytoplasmic staining for EBV, LMP1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, TSP-1 and nuclear staining for Survivin at the tumor cells were considered as positive. Immunohistochemical Score (IHS) was determined by combining an estimate of the ratio (%) of immunoreactive cells (quantity score) with an estimate of the staining intensity (intensity score) for Cox-2. The details of staining steps and evaluation parameters were explained in our previous papers [2–5]. "

1843,S0022-5223(08)00029-9,Primary esophageal large T-cell lymphoma mimicking esophageal carcinoma: A case report and literature review," Clinical Summary A 64-year-old Chinese man, with no other significant medical history, was seen with a 6-month history of dysphagia, initially with solid food and later progressing to liquids as well. He denied hemoptysis, hematemesis, and weight loss and reported an inactive smoking history of 10 pack-years and occasional alcohol consumption. Results of physical examination were unremarkable, with no palpable lymphadenopathy, ascites, or organomegaly. Initial laboratory values, including blood cell counts, were normal. A barium swallow suggested external compression of the esophagus. On endoscopy, a polypoid necrotic mass was seen just distal to the upper esophageal sphincter, with associated luminal narrowing ( Figure 1, A). Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a full-thickness anechoic lesion. Computed tomographic imagery was notable for thickening of the proximal thoracic esophagus and subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes (Figure E1). Positron emission tomography revealed marked fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the esophageal mass. Initial attempts at biopsy yielded nondiagnostic material consisting mainly of necrotic debris. Rigid esophagoscopy was used to obtain an adequate biopsy sample, which consisted of an atypical infiltrate of large lymphocytes ( Figure 2, A), demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining to be T cells with loss of CD5 expression. Analysis for T-cell receptor rearrangement confirmed the presence of a monoclonal population, and the lesion was classified as a peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the large cell type. After three cycles of chemotherapy with ifosfamide, methotrexate, etoposide, and prednisone, a 1.4-cm fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nodule was found in the posterolateral left lung base (Figure 1, B). Wedge resection was performed, and histologic examination revealed the presence of large, transformed lymphocytes (Figure 2, B). Flow cytometry distinguished a T-cell population with aberrant loss of surface CD3 and CD5. A clonal T-cell population related to the esophageal tumor was demonstrated by gene rearrangement analysis, consistent with pulmonary involvement by the primary esophageal lymphoma. Chemotherapy was administered for six additional cycles with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, after which the patient had no evidence of disease. He underwent consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support, a regimen shown to improve survival of patients with aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas. 1  He currently remains without evidence of disease 10 months after the initial diagnosis and 6 months after the lung resection.

His past medical history was significant for a cadaveric renal transplant ten years prior for nephrosclerosis secondary to uncontrolled hypertension. Physical exam revealed bilateral hard, mobile, non-tender axillary lymphadenopathy measuring 3×3 centimeters. There was no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. His remaining exam was unremarkable. Computed tomography scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral 3 centimeter axillary lymph nodes and bilateral 1 centimeter inguinal lymph nodes. A positron emission tomography scan was negative. Laboratory tests showed a normal total white blood cell count of 8.8×109/L (reference range 4.8–10.8), minimally elevated hemoglobin of 185 g/L (130–180), mildly decreased platelet count of 100×109/L (141–450), elevated serum erythropoietin of 26.5 mU/mL (4.1–19.5), and elevated total bilirubin of 94.1 ?mol/L (3.4–17.1) with a normal direct bilirubin. Serologic testing for EBV showed IgG antibodies to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen and viral capsid antigen; IgM antibodies were negative. Polymerase chain reaction for EBV DNA performed on blood was also negative. Excisional biopsy of a left axillary lymph node showed follicular lymphoma, grade 1 with focal progression to grade 2 ( Fig. 1A). The entire nodal architecture was effaced by a nodular lymphoid proliferation. The infiltrate consisted of predominantly centrocytes admixed with variable numbers of centroblasts (Fig. 1B). Most areas showed less than 5 centroblasts per high power field (grade 1) but a few small foci contained 5-15 centroblasts per high power field (grade 2). Immunophenotypic analysis of the lymphoid cells was performed by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry. The neoplastic lymphoid cells expressed B-cell markers CD19, CD20, CD10, and HLA-DR; showed monoclonal surface lambda light chain expression; and were positive for bcl-2 (weak) and bcl-6. The cells were negative for CD5 and cyclin-D1 (bcl-1). An immunohistochemical stain for EBV-latent membrane protein was negative. Lymph node tissue was mechanically dissociated and cultured in RPMI 1640 media overnight (unstimulated) and for 72 hours (Pokeweed stimulated) for cytogenetic analysis. Routine procedures were used for harvesting the cultures and preparing G-banded metaphases. Conventional metaphase analysis revealed two cytogenetically distinct abnormal clones with the following karyotype: 46,XY,t(11;14)(q13;q32)[2]/48,XX,+7,t(14;18)(q32;q21),+mar[2]/46,XY[17]. One clone had the classic t(11;14) associated with mantle cell lymphoma and an XY sex chromosome complement ( Fig. 2A). The other clone had the classic t(14;18) associated with follicular lymphoma, an XX sex chromosome complement, an additional copy of chromosome 7, and a marker chromosome (Fig. 2B). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on paraffin-embedded lymph node tissue using DNA probes specific for the X and Y chromosome centromeres (CEP X/Y, Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Des Plaines, IL) showed distinct areas with XX and XY cells within the lymph node ( Fig. 3). Cells with an XX sex chromosome FISH pattern appeared to have a nodular distribution, corresponding to the neoplastic follicles. Additional FISH studies performed on fixed cell suspensions of the cultured lymph node cells confirmed the presence of t(11;14) in the XY cell population and t(14;18) in the XX cell population. (CEP X/Y was used in combination with LSI IGH/CCND1 XT dual color, dual fusion probe or with LSI IGH/BCL2 dual color, dual fusion probe, Abbott Molecular/Vysis, data not shown). In addition, conventional cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral blood using PHA-stimulated cultures showed one metaphase out of 100 with an XXY sex chromosome complement and the t(14;18) translocation. This finding suggested that the XX,t(14;18) clone represented a neoplastic transformation (gain of X and loss of Y) rather than a constitutional mosaic sex chromosome abnormality. Bilateral bone marrow biopsies showed normocellular bone marrow with no evidence of involvement by lymphoma. Based on the diagnosis of follicular cell lymphoma stage II, the patient was treated with four weekly cycles of rituximab at 375mg/m2 and reduction in immunosuppression. Imaging studies performed four weeks after therapy showed no evidence of disease; he remains in clinical remission 22 months after diagnosis. "

Prior to hospitalization, patient was independent in ambulation, bed mobility, transfers, and activities of daily living. She clinically presented with vision loss, no light perception, and inability to track eyes along with altered mental status, headache, stiff neck, and the following CSF findings: leukocytes 2522/?L, total protein 229 mg/dL, and glucose <20 mg/dL, favoring a meningitis. Patient was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin 1.5 g every 8 hours and intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours, however, remained disoriented, lethargic, and unable to follow commands.

1856,S0145-2126(10)00099-8,Phenotypic and genomic analysis of an exceptional case of enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma," 2 Case history A 62-year-old woman was diagnosed with coeliac disease by serology and small intestinal histology (Marsh IIIB) and subsequently treated with a gluten free diet (GFD). Human Leukocyte Antigen typing showed a DQ2 heterozygous genotype. Seven months after diagnosis she was referred to our hospital with persisting diarrhoea, steatorrhoe, abdominal tenderness and distension, flatulence, regurgitation, night sweat, morning nausea and 10kg of weight loss. Her other medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a pale woman with a BMI of 23.5kg/m2, no fever and she had a distended and slightly painful abdomen. Neither hepatomegaly nor lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory evaluation showed anaemia, elevated CRP, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and deficiency of zinc, folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6. Malnutrition was treated with total parenteral nutrition and all trace elements and vitamins were supplied. Nonetheless, the anaemia persisted and inflammatory markers, liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase further increased. Coeliac specific serology, including endomysial antibodies (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA), was still positive at the time of referral but substantially decreased in the following 2 months. A dietary inquiry performed by a skilled dietician in CD showed strict adherence to the GFD. At time of referral duodenal biopsies were classified as Marsh IIIB lesions based on intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia and subtotal villous atrophy, however without signs of malignancy. Immunohistochemical staining of the duodenal biopsies suggested the presence of an immunophenotypically aberrant IEL population, expressing CD3 but lacking expression of CD8. In order to confirm the presence as well as the precise quantity of aberrant IEL, intestinal lymphocytes were isolated from duodenal biopsies and analysed by flowcytometry as previously described [13,20]. Within the IEL compartment, 66% of lymphocytes showed the aberrant immunophenotype CD3-CD4/8-CD7+cytoplasmicCD3+, indicating RCD type II associated aberrant IEL [13]. In addition, 22% of lymphocytes within the lamina propria compartment (LPL) showed a similar aberrant immunophenotype. Based on the presence of >20% aberrant IEL, her clinical condition and persisting villous atrophy for which no other cause could be identified, she was diagnosed with RCD type II. Other investigations included abdominal ultrasound, CT- and PET scan, showing slight dilatation of the pancreatic and common bile duct, a few slightly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with a maximum of 13mm in diameter, hepatomegaly and steatosis hepatis. Cladribine, a purine analogue inducing T-cell depletion, was subsequently given intravenously for 5 days aiming to eradicate the aberrant intestinal T cells. After 2 months, no clinical and histological response was attained. Duodenal biopsies still showed subtotal villous atrophy in agreement with a Marsh IIIB lesion, however, no intraepithelial lymphocytosis was observed. In our experience the latter phenomenon is often observed upon cladribine treatment. In contrast to the persisting histological abnormalities, the relative percentage of aberrant IEL and LPL decreased to 44% and 18%, respectively, after cladribine treatment. Subsequent CT scan, video capsule endoscopy and MRI-enteroclysis showed abnormalities suspicious for lymphoma, including jejunal ulcers, multiple enlarged mesenterial lymph nodes, diffuse wall thickening of the jejunal-ileal border up to 12mm, marked ascites and peritoneal lesions. Bone marrow analysis showed no abnormalities. Cytological analysis of the ascitic fluid showed many small to medium sized atypical lymphocytic cells most likely associated with lymphoma development. Importantly, an identical clonal TCR-gamma gene rearrangement was found in the ascitic fluid derived cells as compared to duodenal biopsy derived lymphocytes, thereby supporting both the diagnosis EATL and the intestinal origin of this malignancy. Due to clinical deterioration no further treatment was possible and our patient deceased within 3 weeks after the diagnosis of this rare ascitic presentation of EATL. "

1902,S0190-9622(08)01429-1,Two cases of syringotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and review of the literature,"Folliculotropic MF is a variant of MF characterized by infiltration of atypical lymphocytes into hair follicles, often with sparing of the epidermis. Most cases show mucinous degeneration of the hair follicles, hence the term “follicular mucinosis.” Clinically, this subtype of MF preferentially involves the head and neck areas and is usually associated with alopecia, and sometimes with mucinorrhea. 1  In some instances, prominent infiltration of both follicular epithelium and eccrine glands occurs and is then designated as syringotropic MF according to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO)-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification. 1  A very similar pathologic condition, termed “syringolymphoid hyperplasia” or “syringolymphoid hyperplasia with alopecia” (SLHA), occurs when there is alopecia in addition to infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells within and around the eccrine glands. There is also glandular and ductal epithelial hyperplasia, which ultimately results in luminal obliteration. Syringolymphoid hyperplasia was first described by Sarkany in 1969, 2  and in 1984 3  it was distinguished from lymphomatoid granulomatosis, a condition that is now regarded as a B-cell lymphoma with a prominent T-cell infiltrate. In 1992, Burg and Schmockel 4  first suggested that SLHA might represent a syringotropic form of CTCL although T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was negative in their case. 5  It is now thought that virtually all cases of SLHA are syringotropic forms of MF. 3  However, the relationship between folliculotropic MF and syringotropic MF has remained unclear, especially regarding whether they overlap or precede one another and the difference in their prognosis."
1907,S0046-8177(08)00542-X,Extranodal nasal-type natural killer/T-cell lymphoma of the skin: a clinicopathologic study of 16 cases in China," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Patient selection Twenty-two patients with cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphomas were collected from the Pathology Department, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, from January 2000 to June 2007. Six of them were excluded from the study because of insufficient materials or problems with the clinical data. The remaining 16 cases, including the cases with initial (12 cases) and secondary (4 cases) clinical presentation of lymphoma in the skin, were selected for this study. The histologic diagnosis of the tumors was based on the World Health Organization (WHO)-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification of cutaneous lymphomas (2005) [27] and the WHO classification for tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (2001) [28]. The criteria were as follows: (1) examination of histologic features on slides of skin biopsies; (2) immunophenotype analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, including B- and T-cell differentiation antigens, the NK-associated marker of CD56, cytotoxic granules, and proliferation index; (3) in situ hybridization for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–encoded small molecular mRNA; and (4) T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis [18]. The clinical features of these 16 patients, including age, sex, clinical course, and follow-up data were compiled. The staging evaluation was based on the Ann Arbor Classification (1971) [29]. All patients had a staging evaluation that included a thorough physical examination, especially examination of the entire skin, palpation of superficial lymph node regions and organomegaly; complete blood count, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurement, a bone marrow biopsy, and computed tomographic (CT) scans of the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.   2.2 Histopathologic review Routine hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections were used to assess histologic features. The mitotic index was estimated by counting the number of mitotic figures in 10 randomly selected high-power fields (HPF) at 40×10 magnification on a Leica 020-518.500 DM/LS microscope (Leica Microsystems Holding GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).   2.3 Immunohistochemistry analysis The following antibodies were used: CD3? (polyclonal; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), CD4 (1F6; Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), CD5 (4C7, Novocastra), CD8 (C8/144B; Dako), CD20 (L26; Dako), CD30 (Ber-H2; Dako), CD45RO (UCHL1; Dako), CD56 (123, C3; Zymed, South San Francisco, CA), granzyme B (GZB01; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), TIA-1 (2G9; Dako), MPO (polyclonal; Dako), TdT (SEN28; Novocastra), ALK-1 (polyclonal, Zymed, South San Francisco, CA), and ki-67 (MIB-1, Dako). Four-micrometer-thick sections were cut and deparaffinized in xylene and then hydrated in a graded series of ethanol. The slides were treated by pressure cooking in citric acid buffer (10 mmol/L, pH 7.4) for 3 minutes before staining for CD3?, CD8, CD20, CD45RO, CD56, granzyme B, and MPO and in EDTA (1 mmol/L, pH 9.0) for 8 minutes before staining for CD4, CD5, CD30, TIA-1, TdT, ALK-1, and Ki-67. The Envision method was used for immunohistochemical staining with diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a substrate. The positive signal was dark brown.   2.4 In situ hybridization In situ hybridization was carried out with a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to 2 EBV-encoded small RNAs, EBER-1 and EBER-2 (EBER1/2) (Dako-Y520001). Rabbit anti-FITC antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Dako) was used to combine with the probe, whereas NBT/BCIP was used as a substrate. The dark blue-purple hybridizing signal was located in the cell nucleus.   2.5 DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction Genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue samples was extracted by phenol-chloroform procedures. Successful extraction was confirmed by amplification of a 110–base pair fragment of ?-globin. Both universal TCR? (TVG/TJX) primers and the BIOMED-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex tubes (TCR?+TCR?) [30,31] were used for TCR gene rearrangement analysis. For universal TCR? (TVG/TJX) detection, the major procedure was as follows: 1 ?L of each primer at 25 ?mol/L (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) was used in a 25-?L reaction mixture. The PCR mixture (Takara) contained 2.5 ?L of 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 ?L of MgCl2 25 mmol/L, 2 ?L of dNTP 2.5 mmol/L, 1.25 U of Taq polymerase, and 1 ?g of template DNA. Five microliters of PCR products was electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel (110 V, 30 minutes). Gels were stained with Goldview (Saibaisheng, China) and examined with ultraviolet light using Image Acquisition and Analysis Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The BIOMED-2 PCR multiplex tubes (TCR?+TCR?) detection was according to the procedure of van Dongen et al [30].   2.6 Survival and statistical analysis Follow-up data were available for 15 (93.8%) of the 16 patients. The overall survival time was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier (SPSS 13.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL).  "
1918,S0344-0338(08)00047-2,Cytokeratin expression in hematological neoplasms: A tissue microarray study on 866 lymphoma and leukemia cases," Materials and methods  Samples and tissue microarray construction B- and T-cell lymphomas (n=619), HL (n=291), acute leukemias (n=148) and one plasma cell myeloma, diagnosed between 1974 and 2001 and reclassified according to the World Health Organization criteria [5], were collected from the archives of the Institutes of Pathology at the University Hospitals of Basel (Switzerland), Innsbruck (Austria), Triemli City Hospital, Zurich (Switzerland), and the Unit of Hematopathology at the University of Bologna (Italy). Paraffin blocks were selected based on availability and preservation. Clinical and follow-up data were obtained by chart reviews. Retrieval of tissue and clinical data was done according to the regulations of the local institutional review boards and data safety laws. The TMA were constructed and validated as described elsewhere [20]. Totally, our arrays contained 362 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), 6 Burkitt lymphomas (BL), 77 small cell lymphomas/chronic lymphocytic leukemias (SLL/CLL), 19 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 86 follicular lymphomas (FL), 1 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 7 lymphoplasmacytic immunocytomas (IC), 28 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), 28 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AILT), 5 anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), 291 HL and 148 acute lymphoblastic and myelogenous leukemias (acute leukemia/bone marrow TMA). The primary bone-lymphoma TMA (already integrated in DLBCL) also contained one plasma cell myeloma for comparison. Immunohistochemical results from previous studies with the same TMA [17–21] were taken from our database and compared with actual findings.   Morphometrical analysis The total number of cells and, in cases of HL, of Hodgkin and Reed–Sternberg cells (HRSC) on the array spots was counted on H&E and, in cases of HL, on CD30-stained slides at ×200 magnification, so that the total amount of cells on the array spots was known.   Immunohistochemistry TMA slides were processed by preparation with CC-1-retrieval solution for CK22 staining on an automated immunostainer (Benchmark XT, Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA). The primary monoclonal anti-CK22 antibody (Clone V3022 from Biomeda, Foster City, CA, USA) was diluted 1:100 and the slides incubated for 32min. Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining (incubated for 8min) together with Bluing Reagent (Ventana) (incubated for 4min). In order to determine if CK22-positive lymphomas express CK of simple or stratified epithelia, CK5/6 and CK8 stainings were performed. The primary anti-CK5/6- (Clone D5/26 B4 from Dako, Baar, Switzerland) and anti-CK8 antibodies (Clone Ks8.7 from Progen, Heidelberg, Germany) were diluted 1:25. Microwave oven pretreatment for 30min in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was used for antigen retrieval at 98°C. Because intensity varies between cases due to different tissue preservation, only the absolute count of positively staining tumor cells and not the staining intensity was considered. In HL, the percentage of positive HRSC accounted for the positivity, while in B- and T-cell lymphomas, the percentage of all positively staining cells was taken into consideration.  "
1933,S0022-510X(08)00558-3,Metastatic CNS lymphoma presenting with periventricular dissemination — MRI and neuropathological findings in an autopsy case," 2 Case report A 70-year-old man had noticed a mass in the left supraclavicular fossa, but did not consult a hospital. About 1 month later, he presented with bilateral parkinsonism including gait disturbance, akinesia, mask-like face, and dysphagia. He was admitted to our hospital about 3 months after the onset. Physical examination on admission demonstrated consciousness disturbance with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12 (E3 V4 M5), swelling of the left supraclavicular lymph nodes, measured approximately 4 by 5 cm, and was not mobile. Coarse crackles were heard in the lower part of the bilateral lungs. Neurological examination disclosed generalized muscle rigidity including neck rigidity. Blood tests showed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 665 IU/l (normal range: 100–250), soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) 4700 U/ml (normal range <530). Enhanced chest and abdominal CT disclosed swelling of the left supraclavicular, paraaortic, and peritoneal lymph nodes. Galium citrate scintigraphy showed abnormal accumulations in the left supraclavicular area, abdominal cavity, and pelvic cavity. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image of brain MRI demonstrated hyperintensities in the parenchyma around the lateral ventricle, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle (Fig. 1 ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image demonstrated abnormal enhancement around the lateral ventricle, third ventricle, fourth ventricle, and pituitary gland, accompanied by low intensity areas at the periventricular parenchyma suggesting edema (Fig. 2 ). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a cell count of 1/mm3, total protein 150 mg/dl, glucose 56 mg/dl, sIL-2R 363 U/ml (normal range <85). Cytology of the CSF was negative. Biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph nodes established a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, repeated (six times) CSF examinations did not detect lymphoma cells. Although the symptoms and MRI findings improved with the intravenous administration of corticosteroid (hydrocortisone of 100 mg/day) and intralumbar methotrexate (15 mg/week) (Fig. 3 ), he died of multiple organ failure about 5 months after the onset. At autopsy, swelling of the systemic lymph nodes, and masses at the left supraclavicular area, pancreas, abdominal aorta, and left adrenal gland were demonstrated. Ascites was also present. Microscopic examination disclosed that the lymphoma cells invaded the liver, pancreas, spleen, left adrenal gland, large bowel, and bone marrow. The brain weight was 1430 g before fixation. Brain tissue samples were fixed postmortem with 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Ten-micrometer-thick sections from the right frontal lobe (the most anterior section), left head of the caudate nucleus, left amygdala, right subthalamic nucleus, right lateral geniculate body, right pulvinar nucleus, right occipital lobe, pons, medulla oblongata, and bilateral cerebellum were prepared. These sections were stained by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Klüver-Barrera (KB) methods. External examination disclosed fresh subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages. A large thrombus was found in the superior sagittal sinus. Leptomeninges were unremarkable. On sections, fresh hemorrhages were seen in the left posterior lobe and left cerebellum. Microscopically, tumor cells were disseminated in the parenchyma adjacent to the bilateral anterior horn, bilateral inferior horn, and right posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, and the bottom of the third ventricle. The bilateral caudate nucleus, septum pellucidum, right thalamus, bilateral hippocampus, white matter of the right occipital lobe, and trunk of the corpus callosum were involved (Figs. 4, 5  ). Tumor cells were occasionally located in the Virchow-Robin space. Ependymal cells disappeared at the lesions where the tumor cells invaded (Fig. 5a). Tumor cells were also seen in the fourth ventricle, and in some parts of the dura and pia mater. The parenchymal lesions included necrotic foci and vascular proliferation. Tumor cells were not demonstrated in the choroid plexus within the sections. Immunophenotyping demonstrated that the infiltrating cells were CD20 (L26, mouse, monoclonal, 1:100, Dako) positive (Fig. 5b). "
1966,S1079-2104(05)01046-2,Case report: B-cell lymphoma of the maxillary sinus,"During the early stages of development, when no major mass or destruction is apparent, central malignant lesions in the tooth-bearing areas or maxillary sinuses may mimic, radiographically and clinically, common odontogenic and antral diseases. A malignant lesion growing in the alveolar process may produce pain or tooth mobility, which could be easily mistaken for a complication of inflammation of pulpal or periodontal origin. The panoramic radiographic appearance of a malignant lesion developing in the maxillary sinus or extending into it from the alveolar process may be similar to that of a mucous retention pseudocyst or sinusitis. In addition, in dental radiographs, superimposition of surrounding normal structures on the maxillary sinus can obscure details of the malignant lesion so that its true nature can be missed. 4  "
1967,S2210-2612(14)00319-8,Mantle cell lymphoma presenting as acute appendicitis," 2 Presentation of case A 75 year old male with a history of mantle cell lymphoma diagnosed 3 years prior went to his primary medical doctor with a complaint of right lower quadrant abdominal pain for 3 days. The primary medical doctor advised the patient to obtain a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis at an outpatient facility. The pain started as a vague right lower abdominal pain that worsened as time has passed. The patient denied any nausea, vomiting, or anorexia. He stated that he had a low grade fever a couple of days ago. After the CT scan result, the doctor told the patient to go to an emergency room. Physical examination was significant for mild tenderness in right lower quadrant of abdomen but was soft and with no guarding. The patient had a significant lymphadenopathy in his left side of neck. White blood cell count was within normal with a slight shift. The outpatient CT scan showed acute appendicitis with no signs of perforation and prominent abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes (Fig. 1 ). For acute appendicitis, the patient was taken to OR for laparoscopic appendectomy on the same day. In May 2011, the patient presented with left cervical lymphadenopathy for which he was taken to OR for lymph node biopsy. The lymph node specimen revealed mantle cell lymphoma with immunohistochemical stains positive for CD20, Pax-5, CD5, CD43, BCL-1, and BCL-2 while negative for CD10 and BCL-6. A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed without any complication. The appendix was adhered to terminal ileum and omentum. Careful adhesiolysis was carried out to free the appendix. Using a LigaSure device to divide the mesoappendix, the base of appendix was visualized and the appendix was transected using an EndoGIA stapling device. The patient recovered post-operatively without any complication and was discharged on the post-op day 2. The pathology of appendix specimen revealed acute appendicitis and periappendicitis with the lumen of appendix filled with and appendiceal wall replaced with small to intermediate size lymphocytes (Fig. 2 ). The immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD20, Pax-5, BCL-1 and BCL-2 and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, and BCL-6, consistent with mantle cell lymphoma (Figs. 3–6    ). On the follow up appointment in office, the patient is scheduled to meet his oncologist to have a regimen of chemotherapy for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. "
1972,S0167-5273(15)30851-2,Primary cardiac lymphoma: Two rare cases,"Case 1: A 61-year-old female with palpitation and dyspnea for 10days. Physical examination showed systolic and diastolic murmur at the third intercostal of left sternal border. Electrocardiography (EKG) showed low voltages on all limb leads and sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly. Laboratory test: Tumor markers showed cancer antigen 125 was elevated (167.9U/ml, normal range: 0 to 35U/ml). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large mass almost completely filling right atrium (RA), penetrated right atrial free wall, tricuspid annulus and right ventricular free wall, resulting in functional tricuspid stenosis. There was a large amount of pericardial effusion. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was normal (Fig. 1A and Video 1). Contrast-enhanced echocardiography showed a lobulated mass with plenty of blood in the right atrium and a thickened right ventricular wall (Fig. 1B and Video 2). Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a large, lobulated mass fill in the right atrium, invading pericardium and part of the right ventricular free wall (Fig. 1C and Video 3). According to the imaging information, malignancy cardiac mass was considered, cardiac surgery was performed to relieve the symptom and diagnosis. The surgeon found large amount of pericardial effusion in light yellow color. The surface of the right atrium and ventricular free wall was infiltrated by a crisp texture tumor tissue with plenty vessels (Fig. 2A). There was a crisp texture, jelly, opaque huge mass (4×5×6cm) in the right atrium, the tumor infiltrated into the tricuspid annulus. Because there was no capsule and clear border, it was hard to remove the whole mass. The surgeon cleared the tumor as possible from the right atrium as they could, the content see Fig. 2B; as the result, the right ventricular inflow tract was cleared. The histopathologic diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (Fig. 2C,D). The patient died due to heart failure two weeks after the operation."
1974,S1516-8484(15)00168-1,A difficult case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma to diagnose," Case report A 56-year-old man with generalized lymphadenomegaly (neck, abdomen, inguinal, supraclavicular and axillar regions) came to the Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo for treatment. The disease was first noticed three months previously. The initial lymph node biopsy, performed in another hospital, suggested nodular sclerosis HL. It was described as a lymphoid infiltrate in a background of eosinophils, prominent vessels and large cells, suggestive of Reed-Sternberg cells (CD45+, CD3? CD20?, CD30+, CD15+, and EBV negative). At admission, the complete blood count showed 10.2g/L hemoglobin, 12.4×109/L white blood cell count with 5.4×109/L lymphocytes and 270×109/L platelets. Leukocyte immunophenotyping by flow cytometry showed 11% of mCD3? CD5+, CD4bright, CD8? and CD26partial lymphoid T-cells (Figure 1 ). Furthermore, a bone marrow biopsy demonstrated absence of lymphoma infiltration. The patient was submitted to a fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan that showed increased uptake of FDG located in superficial and deep lymph node chains. The exam also indicated a reversal of the metabolic pattern between liver and spleen. A review of the histological specimens from the previous biopsy at our center revealed atypical lymphoid cells with expansion in the paracortical zone and a moderate number of eosinophils. However, we did not repeat the immunohistochemical analysis in this sample because it was very small. Therefore, another biopsy was indicated, and a core biopsy was chosen because it could be done faster. The histological analysis of the new material was compatible with reactive lymphadenopathy. In the next few days, the patient's condition worsened. In the meantime, another biopsy was performed, this time a surgical lymph node biopsy. However, the immunochemistry analysis was incomplete when the patient's condition became aggravated. As the revision of the initial biopsy was compatible with HL, and due to the quick deterioration in the patient's performance status, our team opted to start treatment for HL with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) regimen. After two ABVD cycles the patient developed severe pancytopenia. The treatment was interrupted due to toxicity. As it was not the expected clinical response, the diagnosis of HL was once more questioned. At that time, a new bone marrow biopsy was made, and the histology showed that the bone marrow tissue was totally substituted by fibrosis. Simultaneously, the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation of the monoclonal rearrangement of the TCR-gamma gene became available, and they were positive: these new data suggested a mature T-cell lymphoproliferative disease. A few days later, the immunohistochemistry of the excisional lymph node biopsy was completed and the diagnosis of AITL was confirmed (Figure 2 ). In the meantime, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated drastically, so another appropriate chemotherapeutic scheme was not prescribed. Unfortunately, the patient died in a short period due to respiratory complications. "
1975,S1027-8117(15)00023-3,A rare presentation of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with generalized cutaneous purpuric lesions," Case report A 70-year-old man with a medical history of chronic hepatitis B virus without any regular medication presented to our outpatient clinic with generalized purpuric skin eruptions for 1 week. The skin examination revealed generalized palpable purpura with confluence over the scalp, trunk, and four limbs (Figure 1 A and B). These skin lesions were asymptomatic. He denied drug allergy or taking any new medication in the recent months. One month ago, he had epigastric pain and tarry stool. In addition, he also experienced other systemic symptoms (general weakness, weight loss, and arthralgia). Panendoscopy was performed, which revealed multiple gastric ulcers. Pathologic findings of the gastric ulcer revealed infiltration of atypical lymphocytes. Histopathologic examination of the purpuric skin over the back showed massive infiltration of pleomorphic atypical lymphocytes from the dermis to the epidermis (Figure 2 A). There was extravasation of erythrocytes in the dermis and epidermis without apparent findings of vasculitis. Infiltration of neoplastic atypical lymphocytes was seen in the upper dermis with Pautrier microabscess (Figure 2B). Immunohistochemical studies of the abnormal lymphoid cells confirmed T-cell lineages with positive results for CD3 and negative findings for CD20 and CD30 (Figure 2C and D). Morphology of abnormal lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood smear showed abundant polylobulated “flower” cells (Figure 3 A and B). The stomach biopsy specimen was examined, which revealed dense infiltration of the mucosa by atypical lymphocytes (Figure 4 ). The presence of HTLV-1 in patient's serum was confirmed by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. Laboratory data revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 73,000/?L), mild anemia (hemoglobin, 11.1 g/dL), normal white blood cell count (6220/?L) with 7% atypical lymphocytes; however, the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and cryoglobulin were within normal limits. In addition, laboratory findings revealed other abnormalities including elevation of liver enzymes, alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase (198/220 IU/L; normal range < 40 IU/L), marked elevations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 1708 IU/L; normal range, 91–180 IU/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP; 9.7 mg/dL; normal range < 0.8), hypoalbuminemia (3.2 g/dL; normal range, 3.8–5.3 g/dL), and hypercalcemia (10.8 mg/dL; normal range, 8.4–10.2 mg/dL). Radiologic imaging, bone marrow imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid aspiration were arranged for staging. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging showed massive lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular, bilateral para-aortic, and bilateral inguinal regions, and in the right shoulder joint, as well as increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake over the bilateral lobes of the liver and the CNS. Bone marrow smear showed atypical proliferation of lymphoid cells and positive staining for CD45, CD1, and CD3, and negative staining for CD20, CD30, and cytokeratin (Figure 3C and D). Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow aspiration for blasts showed 3.7% mature T lymphocytes, 3.5% B lymphocytes, and 2.7% natural killer cells with normal antigenic expression. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood revealed 10.9% identical aberrant intermediate- to large-sized T cells, which were positive for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, and CD8, and negative for CD5 and CD56. Cerebrospinal fluid, cytologic findings, and cell block studies also revealed T-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement. Based on the clinical manifestations and laboratory, imaging, and histopathological, and immunohistochemical studies, we diagnosed an aggressive subtype of acute ATLL (leukemic form) by the Shimoyama classification. We staged the tumor according to the Ann Arbor Staging Classification as T-cell lymphoma/leukemia stage IV with cutaneous, stomach, bone marrow, and CNS involvement. The patient was treated with serial chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin, etoposide, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and methotrexate). He continued to receive these chemotherapy regimens for 4 months, but the response was poor. His condition deteriorated and he died 5 months after the initial presentation. "
1976,S0967-5868(15)00088-0,Central nervous system lymphoma presenting as trigeminal neuralgia: A diagnostic challenge," 2 Case report A 55-year-old man presented with a 6month history of severe, paroxysmal, electric-like facial pain in the distribution of the right V3 nerve that initially involved the upper lip and cheek but gradually progressed to include numbness over the chin. Physical examination revealed no evidence of neurological deficit other than diminished sensation over the chin. Other medical conditions included coronary artery disease managed with aspirin, clopidogrel, lisinopril and metoprolol, hypercholesterolemia managed with rosuvastatin and ezetimbe, and depression managed with sertraline. Family and social history were non-contributory. The man was presumptively diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia. He did not tolerate carbamazepine (discontinued following development of rash) and did not respond to pregabalin or gabapentin. Based on this lack of response to pharmacotherapy, the patient elected to pursue microvascular decompression. An MRI study conducted as part of the work-up for this procedure demonstrated an avidly enhancing extra-axial right sphenoid wing mass impinging on the cisternal segment of the right trigeminal nerve, measuring approximately 40mm anterior-posteriorly, 20mm left to right and 25mm superior-inferiorly in greatest dimensions and with a prominent dural tail extending approximately 10mm laterally across the middle cranial fossa (Fig. 1 ). The mass extended into the infratemporal fossa through a markedly expanded right foramen ovale (measuring approximately 7mm), extended slightly into the right inferior orbital fissure, and appeared to extend into the foramen rotundum. There was marked effacement of the right Meckel’s cave (Fig. 2 ), partial effacement of the right cavernous sinus, and a moderate mass effect on the anteromedial aspect of the right temporal lobe. The lesion was adjacent to the paraclinoid right internal carotid artery but notably did not cause stenosis or compression. Based on the anatomic location and radiographical characteristics of this lesion, the mass was thought to be most consistent with either trigeminal schwannoma or meningioma and was treated conservatively. However, the man returned earlier than expected with progressive pain symptoms within 8weeks. A repeat MRI study showed that the mass had increased in size and also demonstrated increased subcortical white matter T2-weighted hyperintensity suggesting pial invasion. He proceeded to undergo right V3 rhizotomy and right temporal craniotomy. An intra-operative frozen pathological specimen of the tumor was indeterminate and partial resection of the right sphenoid wing mass (sparing the cavernous sinus segment) was achieved in view of the indeterminate pathology result and risk of injury to structures in the cavernous sinus. Permanent histopathology revealed a tumor consisting of medium to large sized lymphoid cells with polymorphic and multi-lobulated nuclei of B cell phenotype (CD20 positive). The cells were Pax5 positive, Bcl2 negative, Bcl6 positive, MUM1 negative, negative for Epstein-Barr encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization and had a high Ki-67 labeling index of 50%. These findings were indicative of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient’s facial pain was dramatically alleviated following the partial resection. Given the histopathological identity of the tumor, he was referred for staging investigations. Lactate dehydrogenase measurement was within normal limits and human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative. MRI of the spine found a T1-weighted hypointense focus in the right anterior C4 vertebral body corresponding to slightly increased metabolic activity on positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Scrotal ultrasound and whole body CT scans revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology and bone marrow biopsy revealed no abnormal cells or leptomeningeal involvement. The man was diagnosed as having DLBCL with synchronous primary CNS and systemic pathological features and was started on high dose methotrexate and rituximab for CNS disease followed by focal radiation to the tumor area for local control and additional pain relief. Consolidation systemic multi-drug chemotherapy (R-CHOP: rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, oncovin, prednisone) followed. The man reported a significant improvement in facial pain following surgery, with only mild intermittent headaches. There are no residual neurological deficits. There have been no signs of relapse over 4months of close follow-up. "
1978,S1297-319X(08)00235-2,A case of malignant primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in skeletal muscle treated by exclusive chemotherapy," 2 Case report Mrs M., aged 66, presenting an inguinal mass which appeared progressively in the 2 months prior to her visit. She had no notable previous history of trauma or infection. There was no fever and no impairment in her general state of health. The physical examination revealed a single inguinal mass which was not painful to palpation and appeared to be firm, immobile, and embedded deep in the muscle structure. It was non-pulsatile upon coughing. The remainder of the examination did not reveal any vascular or nerve anomalies. The standard x-ray of the hip and thigh was normal. An ultrasonography showed the features, topography and proportions of the tumour. It appeared hypoechogenic, deeply embedded, and extended from the inner back thigh to the inguinal region. It began in the ischium and was 115mm in length, 60mm in width and 50mm in thickness (Fig. 1a). It did not enclose any vascular elements and presented some dividing walls reminiscent of intermuscular septa (Fig. 1a). An MRI scan showed a mass with a hyperintense signal in fat-sat echo gradient sequence enhanced with injection of gadolinium (Fig. 1b) and an isosignal in T1 sequence (Fig. 1c). The mass was situated in the inner back thigh compartment and had invaded the semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles. The regional and distance spread assessment, carried out by CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvic region due to suspicion of a malignant tumour, found no secondary lesions. At this stage, the possible diagnoses put forward were liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or synovial sarcoma. The mass was close to the surface of the back thigh. A biopsy was carried out using the posterior approach. Immunohistochemical study (Figs. S1–S4; see the supplementary material associated with this article online) found dense and diffuse tumoral cell proliferation with an abundant tumoral necrosis and a high mitotic index. The histological aspect with the antibodies staining profile (CD 20+, CD 30?, CD 15?, BCL 2?, AE1/AE3?, EMA?, pS100?, HMB 45?, Desmine?, Myogénine?, Ki-67 +, Bcl 2?) makes us to diagnose a malignant stage IV non-Hodgkin's B-type lymphoma, highly malignant with Bcl 2 negative and high blood LDH levels. After multidisciplinary oncological discussion, treatment with selective chemotherapy was decided. Mrs M. underwent 8 cycles of CHOP-MABTHERA-type chemotherapy. Tolerance was good with no infectious or haematological incidents. The MRI follow-up scans showed full regression of the mass. Clinical and radiographic follow-up (MRI of thigh and CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvic region) was regular and closely spaced. Three years after diagnosis, Mrs M.'s general state of health is excellent, no signs of local or remote recurrence (Fig. 2a,b). "
1979,S2211-7539(15)00020-2,Primary invasive aspergillosis with disseminated intravascular coagulation as a presenting feature of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma," 2 Case A 62 year old woman presented to the Accident & Emergency department (day 0) with acute abdominal pain, diarrhoea and confusion. Her past medical history was unremarkable except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She had stopped smoking 2 years previously. On examination, she was found to be profoundly hypotensive (blood pressure 60/25mmHg), tachycardic (heart rate 135 per minute) and tachypnoeic (respiratory rate 33 per minute). Her abdomen was tender particularly in the right upper and lower quadrants. There was no organomegaly. Digital rectal examination revealed dark blood. She was resuscitated aggressively with intravenous fluids and inotropic support, started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics (amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, gentamicin, and metronidazole) and transferred to the intensive care unit. Initial blood results showed high bilirubin (30µmol/L), low albumin (27g/L) and modestly elevated C-reactive protein (35mg/L). The white cell count was 8.8×109/L and the neutrophil count was 5.2×109/L with toxic granulations, reactive lymphocytes, and occasional blast forms on blood film. The clotting screen was grossly abnormal (platelets 17×109/L, prothrombin time 16s, fibrinogen 67mg/dl) consistent with DIC. She was administered four units of fresh frozen plasma, four cryoprecipitates and two pools of platelets. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed thickened right colon suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis, for which she was given oral vancomycin empirically. Stool was negative for Clostridium difficile toxin. Chest X-ray showed extensive alveolar shadowing throughout the whole of the visualised right lung and the left upper zone in keeping with active infection. CT of the chest revealed right sided bronchopneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from her sputum and endotracheal aspirate on day 1 and although the significance of this finding was uncertain, she was commenced on IV voriconazole for a presumed active infection. Despite aggressive therapy, the patient died on day 2. The most significant findings at post-mortem examination were pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, and thrombosis of small pulmonary vein branches without infarction. There was no definite evidence of pneumonia. The gastric mucosa was thickened and haemorrhagic with multiple ulcers, the largest being 20mm in diameter with features of recent perforation. The liver was slightly enlarged (1821g) and showed patchy pallor and congestion. The portal vein was focally thrombosed. The spleen was markedly enlarged (534g) with focal infarction. There was minimal lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum. The small and large intestines were normal. Histologically, small foci of intravascular thrombus were confirmed in lung and stomach, some of which were associated with septate fungal hyphae at both sites. Intra-bronchial fungal elements were also identified and were associated with underlying necrosis and destruction of the bronchial wall with invasion of hyphae into the adjacent lung parenchyma ( Fig. 1). Fungi were also identified in the alveolar spaces and interstitium ( Fig. 2). Portal vein thrombosis was confirmed. There was a neoplastic lymphoid infiltrate of medium and large sized cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism in the lymph nodes, the liver mainly in portal areas and widely in the stomach including the site of perforation. There was probable involvement of spleen but this showed marked post-mortem autolysis. On immunohistochemical staining, the neoplastic cells were positive for common leucocyte antigen, CD3, CD43, CD7, and focally for CD57, CD30 and granzyme ( Fig. 3). The cells were negative for CD4, CD8, CD20, CD79a, ALK-1 and Epstein Barr virus. The immunoprofile was thus consistent with ‘peripheral T cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma, not otherwise specified’. A. fumigatus DNA was detected in the tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction. "

2003,S0278-2391(06)01149-9,Spontaneous Regression of an HIV-Associated Plasmablastic Lymphoma in the Oral Cavity: A Case Report," Report of a Case The patient is a 35-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV infection who was referred to our department (Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH) in May 2005 from an outside facility with what was described as an odontogenic infection of the left maxilla. In addition to his HIV status, his only other contributing health history was a previous episode of Pneumocystitis carinii pneumonia and oral thrush (both secondary to his immunodeficiency and both treated and resolved before his presentation). He reported quitting the use of alcohol and smoking cigarettes approximately 5 years earlier. His CD4 count at the time of presentation was 296 cells/?L and his viral load was undetectable. He was started on HAART in January 2005 (consisting of atazanavir sulfate [Reyataz, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY], ritonavir [Norvir, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL], and lamivudine [Combivir, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC]). Before HAART, he had a low CD4 count (37 cells/?L) with a high viral load (>750,000 virons/mL). His initial symptoms began in October 2004, at which time he was noted to have pain in the area of the left maxillary molar region. He underwent extraction by another surgeon of what was thought to be an offending tooth. Over the ensuing months the pain resolved; however, the lesion continued to increase in size and was interfering with his ability to eat normally. During his initial exam he was noted to have a friable purple-red fungating mass approximately 3 cm × 5 cm at the posterior of the left maxillary arch (Fig 1A). The lesion was nonfluctuant and nontender to palpation. Panoramic radiograph revealed significant bone loss of the left maxilla (Fig 2). An incisional biopsy was obtained using a biopsy forceps. The specimen was subjected to various immunohistochemical studies (Table 1), revealing the cells were focally positive for CD79a. A Ki-67 stain showed a labeling index of approximately 50%. The cells were negative for CD3, CD10, CD31, CD45, Keratin, HMB45, and CD30. CD20 was only faintly positive. These findings were confirmed by a separate pathology department at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation where additional immunostains for CD138 and VS38c were performed, revealing the cells are strongly positive for CD138 and VS38c. The cells were found to be negative for CD20 at this facility. The ALK1 stain was determined to be negative at both facilities. Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA in situ hybridization demonstrated approximately 50% of neoplastic B cells positive for Epstein-Barr virus. The histologic sections showed sheets of atypical large lymphoid cells with moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with some cells having plasmacytic to immature plasmablastic features (Fig 3). The final pathology report from both facilities rendered the diagnosis of HIV-associated plasmablastic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or PBL (by World Health Organization classification). The patient returned to our clinic after 1 week. He was noted to have a marked decrease in size of the lesion and the mucosal tissue appeared more normal in coloring (Fig 1B). The lesion remained nontender and he reported being able to eat normally. Computed tomography scan of the midface showed advanced bony deterioration of the left maxillary alveolus extending into the left maxillary sinus (Fig 2A). At 2 weeks the patient manifested no clinical evidence of gross pathology aside from a 3 mm × 3 mm firm, bluish area along the buccal aspect of the maxillary ridge (Fig 1C). Multiple new incisional biopsies were obtained from the oral mucosal site using a biopsy forceps. Flow cytometry immunophenotype studies were ordered, which showed no residual lymphoma population. Because of the aggressive nature of this process, chemotherapy was initiated by the referring facility. However, his clinical course showed marked improvement, with near total remission before starting his therapy. A bone marrow aspiration and core biopsy were obtained and revealed no lymphoma involvement. He also had no evidence of extranodal involvement on computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A liver needle biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy. However, scattered non-necrotizing granulomas were noted in the specimen, which was interpreted as a systemic response to lymphoma. At 1 month from the time of his initial evaluation in our clinic he was completely devoid of any clinical symptoms. "
2017,S0022-510X(08)00258-X,A case of intravascular B-cell lymphoma presenting as myelopathy and diagnosed post mortem," 2 Case report A 70-year-old right-handed man was admitted to our hospital because of numbness and progressive leg paresis for over 1 month, and urinary and defecation problems for more than 20 days. He experienced slow progressive numbness of the lower limbs and buttocks in a descending pattern, which was exacerbated by prolonged walking. About 20 days prior to presentation, he could not walk, and suffered from urinary retention and fecal incontinence. He was treated for “herniation of the intervertebral discs,” which was diagnosed in an unknown local hospital, and failed to improve. He denied having fever, headache, backache, vertigo, or diplopia, any history of diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia, and of use of alcohol, illicit drugs, or tobacco. No lymphadenopathy was apparent. Neurological examination depicted bilateral impairment of light touch and pinprick perception below the L3 dermatome, impaired vibration sensation below the L1 segment, and paraplegia in the lower extremities (i.e., lower motor neuron disease). Abdominal reflexes and cremasteric reflex were absent. After admission, laboratory examinations disclosed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (HBD) (on two occasions, 639 and 691, reference: 110–220 IU/L) with disordered immune and endocrine function. Two CSF examinations revealed increased protein (1.48, 2.13 reference: 0.15–0.45 g/L) and decreased glucose (0.5, 1.5 reference: 2.5–4.4 mmol/L). The CSF IgG synthesis rate was 19.30 mg/day (reference: 0–5.81 mg/day), and no malignant cells were apparent. No signal change was found in the cervical and lumbar spinal cord on MRI with contrast 3 days after admission. Five days after admission, patchy foci in the left occipital lobe near the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle and bilateral centrum semiovale were detected by brain MRI with contrast, and in the periventricular areas without contrast. Bone scan, and bone marrow biopsy with aspirate were normal. EMG (21 days after admission) suggested demyelinating peripheral polyneuropathies in his lower limbs. Follow-up brain MRI with contrast (41 days after admission) showed patchy lesions in the subcortical white matter of the bilateral centrum semiovale and ring- or nodular enhancing lesions in periventricular areas. The disease followed a progressive downhill course and he developed impaired consciousness and sudden onset of insanity and disorientation 31 days after admission, despite symptomatic and supportive treatment. He died of respiratory and circulatory failure 8 weeks after admission. Autopsy disclosed large neoplastic lymphoid cells in vascular channels of the brain parenchyma (Fig. 1B), meninges (Fig. 1B), spinal cord (Fig. 2 ), and other internal organs. The growth pattern is characteristic of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, which is CD20 (+) and negative for T-cell markers. The definite diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma with central and peripheral nervous system involvement was made. "

2035,S0196-0709(05)00040-2,Primary lymphoma of nasolacrimal drainage system: a case report and literature review," 2 Case report A previously healthy 41-year-old Chinese female presented to the ophthalmologist for a palpable mass over left median canthus region with persistent epiphora. The symptoms had been noted since approximately 1 year ago, when left-sided chronic dacryocystitis with nasolacrimal duct obstruction was diagnosed, and conservative treatment was given. As the symptoms were getting worse without significant improvement, dacryocystorhinostomy was performed. The patient's symptoms had improved markedly after the operation, and recommendation was made for follow-up examination and probable biopsy for presumed tumor if the mass recurred. Two months later, the patient returned to our hospital because of a painful swelling mass just over the same previous location. Palpable fullness was evident in the lacrimal fossa. Inspection found 1 bulging mass over the lateral nasal cavity. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a partially cystic, contrast-enhanced nasolacrimal mass, which was displacing the globe to the left (Fig. 1 ). Further biopsy specimen was obtained for immunohistopathologic examination. Microscopically, the sections of the lacrimal duct showed diffuse, monotonous, large lymphoid tumor cells with prominent nucleoli infiltrating within scattered fibrinoid necrotic tissue (Fig. 2 ). Results of the immunohistochemical studies showed that the lymphoid tumor cells were positive for CD45, CD20, bcl-2, and ? light chain monoclonality, but negative for CD10, CD3, LMP-1 (latent membrane protein 1), and estrogen and progesterone receptor. The patient subsequently had staging MRI of the head, computed tomography scans of the chest and abdomen, complete blood testing, and a bone marrow examination. Only the unifocal left nasolacrimal duct lymphoma was demonstrated, and the patient was classified as stage IE non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These clinical and pathological findings indicate that it was a case of primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the nasolacrimal duct. After all possible treatment options were discussed, the patient selected primary treatment with chemotherapy as opposed to radiation therapy because she was unwilling to accept the risk of radiation effects to the eye. She was treated with 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin), vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP protocol). Follow-up period of 14 months after completion of the chemotherapy revealed only mild left nasolacrimal obstruction. A follow-up MRI of the sinuses confirmed the shrinkage of the tumor without evidence of local recurrence or systemic involvement. "
2038,S1521-6616(15)00213-2,A case of XLF deficiency presented with diffuse large B cell lymphoma in the brain,"A two-year-old boy was referred to our clinic with right focal convulsion and a large fungal plague in the oral mucosa. On the initial physical exanimation, we observed microcephaly (head circumference, HC: 37cm<3p), bird-like face, and severe growth retardation (weight: 4kg<3p, length: 58cm<3p) (Fig. 1A). After treatment of convulsion with anti-epileptic drugs, further investigations were performed to the patient. Also, anti-fungal treatment was initiated with ambisome. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 2×3cm mass lesion in the left temporoparietal region. At first, it was accepted as fungal lesion due to multiple hypo-dense lesions in the lung and liver which were observed in the abdominal ultrasound and thorax CT. After these hypo-dense lesions, caspofungin was added to the patient as a second anti-fungal drug. However, the patient's condition was worsened with recurrent focal convulsions day by day. The size of intracranial mass was found to be increased in the repeated cranial MRIs. After then, cranial biopsy was performed to the patient. It was consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (Fig. 1B). EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative in the blood. The EBV staining was negative with EBV LMP (Epstein Barr virus latent membrane protein) in the tumor material. Reduced chemotherapy regimen was initiated to the patient as rituximab plus intrathecal methotrexate. Also, he is taking IVIG replacement and antimicrobial prophylaxis (TX-TMP and itraconazole). In his medical history, he had recurrent pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and pancytopenia. Laboratory investigations revealed T-B-SCID. The laboratory investigation showed pancytopenia {WBC: 1400/mm3 (4400–12,900) [absolute neutrophil count (ANC): 600/mm3 (1500–4500)], absolute lymphocyte count (ALC): 850/mm3 (2200–8100), hemoglobin: 8.9g/dL, platelet: 89,000/mm3}, normal immunoglobulin levels [IgG: 784mg/dL (365–1200), IgA: 60mg/dL (12–94), and IgM: 190mg/dL (26–201)], diminished number of the lymphocyte subsets without Natural Killer cells (NK) [CD3: 540/mm3 (1300–6500), CD4: 420/mm3 (700–4500), CD8: 130/mm3 (400–3200), NK: 250/mm3 (200–1300), CD19: 60/mm3 (500–3600)]. Also, he had significant reduction in lymphocyte proliferative responses with phytohemagglutinin [stimulation index (SI): 6.8%, control SI: 90.6% (normal range, >50%)]. With genetic test, the homozygous mutation (c.532C>T, p.R178X) was found in exon 5 in the NHEJ1 gene. A related HLA-matched donor could not be found for the patient. Unrelated donor screening is going on."
2055,S1561-8811(14)00124-2,Secondary cardiac lymphoma presenting as a large diffuse pericardial mass," 2 Case report A 66-year-old male with history of diabetes, hypertension, smoking, presented to a regional hospital with 4 months history of progressive dysphagia for solid food with weight loss. Barium swallow reported filling defect in distal esophagus and an oral gastroscopy failed to introduce. This was suspected to be due to external compression. However, patient was noted to have bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and a biopsy done was consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, large B-cell type, CD 20 positive, CD3 and CK negative. Ultrasound abdomen revealed enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes. His chest X-ray showed large hilar enlargement with mild cardiomegaly and right pleural effusion (Fig. 1 ). His retroviral test was negative. He was referred to our institute for computed tomography (CT) staging and chemotherapy. While awaiting a CT scan of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, he underwent an echocardiogram. His transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large diffuse intrapericardial mass anterolateral to left ventricle measuring 7.5 cm × 2.6 cm (Fig. 2 A, B, arrowheads, Movie). There were no intracardiac mass or myocardial nodules. There was minimal pericardial effusion. Rest of echocardiographic examination was normal. CT scan confirmed the large pericardial mass (Fig. 3 A, arrowheads).

2059,S0385-8146(07)00146-0,A case of primary Hodgkin's lymphoma of the parotid gland," 2 Case report In August 2001, a 14-year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a pre-auricular nodule. A CT scan demonstrated a round mass (2cm×2cm) in the right parotid gland (Fig. 1 ). Cytological examination following fine-needle aspiration (FNA) revealed class IV findings, and was highly suggestive of HL. Therefore, an open biopsy was performed under local anesthesia, during which a wedge-shaped portion of the mass (about 1cm3) was carefully removed in order to avoid damage to the facial nerve. This diagnosis was significant only for non-specific lymphadenitis, and the patient was recommended periodic observation without additional treatment. However, the nodule continued to grow and reached a size of 5cm×3cm by the end of January 2002. MRI demonstrated the main tumor as well as multiple smaller nodules in the right parotid gland (Fig. 2 ). All nodules were hyper-intense lesions in the T2-weighted scans (Fig. 2). Based on the rapid clinical and radiological progression, a malignant tumor was highly suspected. A FNA was performed, but the results were inconclusive and revealed only class II cytology. Therefore, in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis, the patient underwent a total parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve (Fig. 3 ). Histological examination confirmed a diagnosis of HL of the parotid gland (Fig. 4 ). Immunophenotyping revealed that the tumor was positive for CD30 and CD20 but negative for CD15, EBV-LMP and EBV-EBNA2. Based on these morphologic and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as mixed cellularity (MC) type. After an extent-of-disease workup, the patient was classified as having Stage IIA disease. He then received four cycles of combination chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) followed by a 30-Gy course of radiotherapy. The patient has been in remission for more than four years since his diagnosis. "

She was completely asymptomatic, with no reported pain or paresthesia. She had first noted enlargement of the area 2 months previously. She reported no injuries to this area, nor had anything like this occurred in the past. Subjectively, she thought the swelling was typically worse in the mornings. The patient’s previous medical history was significant for hypertension, postpartum deep venous thrombosis, and mild degenerative joint disease. The patient had no clinical features of autoimmune disease. She took metoprolol and had no allergies. She denied tobacco or alcohol use. Physical examination revealed a pleasant white female with normal vital signs. Head and neck examination was unremarkable with no external swelling, lymphadenopathy, or tenderness. Intraorally, she presented a 1.5 cm submucosal, nontender, smooth-surfaced lesion of the right floor of mouth, just proximal to the exit of Wharton’s duct. The floor of mouth was slightly elevated and the mucosa overlying the lesion was healthy and nonulcerated (Fig 1). Tongue range of motion was normal, and there was no evidence of paresthesia of the lingual nerve. No other soft or hard tissue lesions were observed. A number of plain film radiographs were obtained, and all were unremarkable for any evidence of obstructing radiopaque sialolith. "

2085,S1353-8292(08)00120-2,"Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) linkage with residence near heavy roads—A case study from Haifa Bay, Israel"," 2 Methods  2.1 Data sources Data from the Israel National Cancer Registry (INCR) were used for the analysis. The INCR is a national population-based cancer registry established in 1960. Reporting is mandatory since 1982 and completeness is over 95%. Registration methods and completeness assessment were described elsewhere (Fishler et al., 2002; Barchana et al., 2004; Beri et al., 2007). In Israel, about 79% of the total population is Jewish. However, among the NHL patients, the percent of the Jewish population is disproportionably higher, reaching some 95% (Barchana, 2007). Haifa is a city with a mixed population where Jews (the majority) and Arabs live together in a few neighborhoods. In order to homogenize NHL rates, we selected only the Jewish patients and did not include the minorities who comprise about 5% of the total number of NHL cases recorded in the study's period.   2.2 NHL cases and geo-coding The residential history of each cancer patient is retrieved from the central population register and transferred to the INCR. The data included are the date of entry into a specific address, the city code, street name and house number. We retrieved all the cases diagnosed with NHL during the period of 1995–2004, who were residents in the Haifa metropolis, according to the specific city code. We then calculated the duration of residence in Haifa, after excluding those who were diagnosed with NHL prior to their residency in the city and its satellite towns. Thus, only patients residing in the metropolis for 10 years or more prior to the date of diagnosis (1512) were included in the analysis. Table 1  presents descriptive information about the NHL patients’ population and shows homogeny in gender distribution and age. Using an updated street map of the city, we used ArcGIS software to geo-code the location of the patients’ homes (given the exact coordinates). Some cases did not have a valid address (only neighborhood name, etc.) and failed to be geo-coded. These were excluded from the analysis. A total of 1436 addresses of the patients (94.9% of all cases) were successfully geo-coded. We checked the cases that were not geo-coded and found no substantial differences in the demographical or disease typing, relative to the geo-coded cases. In the second phase, using a map layer of major roads from the Israel National Roads Company, we calculated the exact distance (in meters) of each participant's residence from the nearest major road. NHL cases were classified into four groups, according to gender and age at the time of diagnosis: male and female; 50–69 years old and 70+ years old (since NHL cases, like many other cancers, are age-depended, the age specific rate was calculated in order to avoid a possible bias). The concentration of NHL patients next to main roads may be indicative of high population densities near these roads, rather than of elevated disease risks. To rule out such a possibility, the spatial distribution of NHL patients in each geographic area should be normalized by the total number of people residing there. However, the information on the home addresses of all residents of the metropolis was unavailable for the analysis. Therefore, we used an alternative approach based on the interpolation of population density values available for 143 small census areas (SCAs) into which the Haifa metropolis is subdivided. In the first phase of the analysis, the density values observed in individual SCAs were interpolated by the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method into a continuous surface of population densities (residents per km2), covering the entire study area. In the second phase of the analysis, the home locations of individual NHL patients were superimposed upon the density surface, thus enabling us to estimate the population density at the place in which each NHL patient resides. This task was performed using the “spatial join” tool of the ArcGIS9™ software, which merges geographically referenced information from different geographic layers (maps) based on the spatial location of individual features in these layers (McCoy and Johnston, 2001). At the next phase of the analysis, the total number of NHL patients was calculated for 10 buffer zones, extending by a 50-m increment from a main road: 0–50, 51–100m, etc. For each road distance buffer, population density was also estimated, by averaging the population densities obtained at the previous phase of the analysis for the home residences of individual NHL patients. The population density estimates obtained thereby for each road distance buffer were then normalized by the average population density observed in the study area, thus enabling us to obtain the values of the “density coefficient” (see Table 2 ). The coefficient takes on values smaller than 1, if a given road distance buffer is less densely populated than the entire study area, and values greater than 1, if the buffer's population density is greater than the average population density in the study area. By dividing the actual number of NHL patients in each buffer zone by the value of the “density coefficient,” we thus obtained the “density adjusted” number of NHL patients in each buffer zone (see Table 2). Testing for the statistical significance of the differences in the number of patients across road buffer zones, was performed using a non-parametric Chi-square test.  "

2097,S0959-8049(08)00094-4,Role of FDG PET in the management of childhood lymphomas – case proven or is the jury still out?," 2 Limitations of conventional imaging including gallium scintigraphy  2.1 Conventional cross sectional imaging Modern conventional imaging modalities (CIM) such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are excellent at delineating the extent of disease involvement in childhood lymphomas and have completely supplanted the need for a staging laparotomy. Although pivotal in the staging of lymphomas, their sensitivity in detecting small volume disease including infiltrative disease at extra-nodal sites such as bone marrow or liver is poor. Another major limitation of conventional CIM is its inability to detect tumour involvement in normal sized lymph nodes or discriminate between fibrous scar and necrotic tissue from active tumour in post treatment residual masses. 2,4–6  The Ann Arbor system for HL 7  and the Murphy staging for NHL 8  incorporate CT and/or MRI as standard investigational modalities for disease staging. Clearly there is a need for a more sensitive (the probability that a person having a disease will be correctly identified by a clinical test; i.e. calculated as the number of true positive results divided by the sum of the numbers of true positive and negative results) and specific (the proportion of patients without a disease who are correctly identified by a test; i.e. the number of true negative results divided by the sum of the numbers of true negative plus false positive results) diagnostic tool for accurate disease staging.   2.2 Gallium scintigraphy The gallium (Ga-67) scan was the standard functional imaging technique in the assessment of response in lymphomas. However, it has many limitations, including the fact that its sensitivity for staging lymphoma varies with localisation, size and cell type 9–12  and its comparative ineffectiveness in evaluating disease in the abdomen due to physiological bowel uptake. Moreover, compared to gallium scans, FDG PET detects more disease sites 12,13  and more accurately defines active disease. 14  In addition, the effective dose of absorbed radiation from a gallium scan is much greater than FDG PET and the majority of other nuclear medicine scans (Table 1 ). Consequently, gallium scanning has fallen out of favour as a functional imaging modality in the management of paediatric lymphomas.   2.3 Review of evidence The review of evidence on which this report is based consists largely of the review of published studies on the use of FDG PET in childhood and adult lymphomas. PubMed and Medline searches were done to ascertain relevant references on the use of PET in lymphomas between 2001 and 2007. Attention is mainly focused on clinical situations where FDG PET is expected to have some bearing on therapy or management.  "

Mikulicz removed the lacrymal and submandibular glands and described his microscopic findings of a uniform infiltrate of small round cells with scattered acini. He considered that although this corresponded histologically to a lymphoma, the limitation of the tumors to the glands and the indolent clinical course did not support this. He concluded that the nature of the disease was a mystery and he hoped that future observers would succeed in solving the riddle that it presented. There were many attempts to do this, and the interest in Mikulicz's disease or syndrome was such that his original paper of 1892 was reprinted together with a translation into English in Medical Classics in 1937. 2,3  "

The patient had noted one episode of melana prior to her admission. Her physical examination results showed a systolic and diastolic pressure of 110/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 106 beats/min, clear breathing sounds, and no abdominal rebounding pain, but slight tenderness over the epigastric area. Her laboratory test results revealed the following: hemoglobin level, 7.1 g/dL; mean cell volume, 66.7%; red cell distribution width, 18.8%; reticulocyte volume, 0.5%; creatinine level, 0.7 mg/dL; serum iron level, 13 ?g/dL; total iron-binding capacity, 409 ?g/dL; ferritin level, 5.2 ng/mL; and a positive stool occult blood test. Because of suspected iron deficiency anemia due to GI blood loss, an upper GI endoscopy was performed to identify the bleeder. Multiple round, sessile, button-like polyp lesions with a slight central depression and ulceration over the top were discovered, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter, in the second and third portions of the duodenum (Figs. 1A–1C). The barium study of jejunum and ileum and colonoscopy both showed negative finding. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan showed focal wall thickening of the duodenum (Fig. 2 ) and lymphadenopathy of the para-aortic area. A histopathological examination of the duodenal biopsy specimens from the polyp lesion showed sheets of neoplastic lymphoid infiltrate in the mucosal layer (Fig. 3A). The immunohistochemical staining showed that the cells were positive for leukocyte common antigen, CD20 (Fig. 3B), CD10, and nuclear B cell lymphoma (BCL-6), and were negative for CD3, CD56, CD5, CD23, chromogranin, and B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2). A very high Ki-67 index (>90%; Fig. 3C) was also observed in the tumor cells. A bone marrow biopsy was negative for tumor involvement.

All patients presented with their first signs of symptoms to the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) and to the Department of Stomatology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Valencia University (Spain) (Reference: H1382188167460), and we followed ethical principles, including the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Each case was registered with the location in the head and neck. We distinguished the intraoral versus the non-intraoral locations of the extra-nodal BNHLs of the head and neck. We also analyzed the histological type of BNHL, the presence of B-symptoms, the affectation of the bone marrow, and the stage of the lymphoma. We grouped stages 1 and 2 as initial stages, and stages 3 and 4 as late stages [5,6]. The treatment was established in the service of hematology following the standard recommendations as described previously [13]. The most common treatment combination was rituximab and cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) in 25.5% of our patients, followed by CHOP and radiotherapy (CHOP+RT) in 16% of the cases. The remaining patients were treated with other combinations. The patients were regularly followed and we performed survival analysis in 55 cases. For non-survivors, the survival time was recorded from the time of diagnosis to the time of death. To determine the significance in the survival study, we performed a Kaplan–Meier analysis with the log rank test (Mantel–Cox); for the prognostic analysis, we performed the Cox regression with the B regression coefficient to determine the significance, the Exp(B)-hazard ratio and the 95% confidence interval for Exp(B). We also used the ?2 test and Student's t-test. Statistical significance was set at p <0.05. "

2154,S0165-4608(04)00236-5,Variant t(14;18) in malignant lymphoma: a report of seven cases," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Specimens Lymph node specimens were received fresh and processed for histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic studies. Immunophenotyping was performed using standard three-color flow cytometry. A proliferation marker, MIB-1, was used to grade the lymphoma. A low-grade lymphoma has an MIB-1 rate less than 30%, intermediate-grade lymphoma has 30–80%, and high-grade or aggressive lymphoma has more than 80% MIB-1 reactivity. Diagnoses were expressed according to the World Health Organization classification [10].   2.2 Cytogenetic analysis Lymph node biopsy specimens were minced and cells were dissociated through a fine needle. Cells were then cultured in RPMI medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. After short-term incubation for 24–48 hours, the cultures were exposed to Colcemid and harvested as described previously [11]. Metaphase cells were Q- or G-banded (or both) and karyotypes were described according to ISCN 1995 [12]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using LSI IGH/BCL2 dual-color, dual-fusion translocation DNA probe set (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). The LSI IGH probe labeled with SpectrumGreen contained sequences homologous to the entire IGH locus, as well as extending ?300 kb beyond the proximal end of the IGH locus. The LSI BCL2 probe labeled with SpectrumOrange covered the entire BCL2 gene, with additional sequences extending ?250 kb both distal and proximal to the gene. The LSI IGH/BCL2 probe is useful for the detection of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation associated with FL. In a normal control, the probes produced two green and two orange signals (2G2O). In cells containing t(14;18)(q32;q21), the probes displayed two sets of fusion signals in addition to one green and one orange signal (1G1O2F). Other patterns resulting from rearrangement of the BCL2 or IGH locus may be observed in some abnormal specimens containing variant translocations. Pretreatment of slides and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions accompanying the probes. The chromosomes were counterstained with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and viewed with the Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope using triple excitation–emission band pass filters (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). We examined 200 interphase cells and 3–10 metaphase cells from each specimen.  "

2164,S0958-2592(14)00104-7,Primary non Hodgkin's lymphoma of talus in a child—A rare presentation," 2 Case history A 6 year old male child developed a vague pain in his right ankle which was insidious in onset, mild in intensity till he suffered a trivial fall in July 2011 while playing cricket which aggravated the pain. He was taken to a general practitioner in his locality who diagnosed it as an ankle sprain and gave a below knee splintage for 3 weeks. Following cast removal after 3 weeks, patient had worsening of pain, was unable to bear weight on his right leg and was referred to our institute for further investigations and treatment. On physical examination, there was tenderness over anterior ankle joint line and over the talus. Ankle movements were painful and restricted. However, there was no clinically detectable swelling in the right foot or ankle region. Superficial lymph nodes were not enlarged. There was no history of constitutional symptoms. Plain radiographs revealed a pathologic fracture of right talus with a destructive osteolytic lesion involving the head of talus arising from the medulla with cortical breakthrough (Fig. 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging showed an altered area of intensity in anterior talus with cortical breech and mild joint effusion (Fig. 2 ), most probably infective (tubercular) or neoplastic in origin. Fine needle aspiration cytology was inconclusive giving a differential diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Ewing's sarcoma or Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis (Figs. 3 and 4  ). As part of the work-up for pathologic fracture, Technitium labelled MDP bone scintigraphy was done which showed increased osteoblastic activity in right talus (site of primary) with no evidence of skeletal metastasis elsewhere. Bone marrow examination was normal. Chest radiographs, ultrasound scan of abdomen and contrast enhanced computed tomography of chest and abdomen failed to show evidence of any lymphomatous deposits. Patient was posted for an open biopsy which revealed a primary diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Flowcytometric immunophenotyping showed positivity for CD 10,19,20, 22, 45, 79a, 79b, lambda and HLA-DRand negative for CD 99, cytokeratin, desmin and CD 3 which was consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, mature B phenotype of the diffuse large B cell variety. Treatment with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate plus etoposide (5 cycles) was successful in establishing remission. Below knee cast was also given for 6 weeks for immobilisation. There was no evidence of recurrence at the 18th month follow up. "
2168,S0196-0709(04)00142-5,Bilateral cystic parotid masses and a hypopharyngeal mass: a case report and review of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in the head and neck," 2 Case report An 83-year-old male nonsmoker presented with nontender right facial swelling that had been present for approximately 5 weeks. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient had no history of malignancy, autoimmune disease, or risk factors for HIV infection. Bilateral parotid swelling was greater on the right than the left. A firm mobile mass was present in the right parotid gland; diffuse fullness was appreciated on the left. Facial nerve function was normal bilaterally. Evidence of a suspicious fullness in the hypopharynx was found on flexible nasopharyngoscopy. Head and neck examination was otherwise unremarkable. Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration of the right parotid mass was nondiagnostic. Bilateral multiple solid and mixed solid-cystic parotid masses were found on computed tomography of the head and neck (Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, a 1.5-cm solid mass was noted at the right base of the tongue and hypopharynx (Fig. 2 ). Multiple cervical lymph nodes without pathological enlargement were noted. On direct laryngoscopy, a 2-cm nodular mass of the tongue base was found adjacent to the lingual surface of the epiglottis. A biopsy specimen was suspected to be lymphoma on frozen tissue sections. On permanent tissues sections, the specimen stained positive for CD20 and Bcl-2, histologic features consistent with MALT lymphoma. Subsequent computed tomography of the chest showed multiple masses throughout both lungs consistent with disseminated disease. Single-agent chemotherapy (chlorambucil) resulted in a favorable early response. "

2187,S0278-2391(14)00436-4,A Case of Oral Plasmablastic Lymphoma and Review of Current Trends in Oral Manifestations Associated With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection," Report of Case A 52-year-old man presented to the emergency room of Parkland Memorial Hospital (Dallas, TX) with the chief complaint of 4 weeks of worsening right-sided facial swelling. The patient reported loosening of teeth on the upper right during the past 4 weeks. He consumed alcohol on rare occasions and denied any history of tobacco or recreational drug use. The oral and maxillofacial surgical service was consulted to respond to a suspected odontogenic infection. The emergency room workup showed the patient to have AIDS, with a CD4 count of 134 and an HIV viral load of 223,446, which was previously unknown to the patient. Extraoral examination disclosed a mild diffuse swelling of the right malar region with no overlying skin changes in this Caucasian patient. No cervicofacial lymphadenopathy was appreciated. An approximately 2- ×2-cm erythematous and lobulated soft gingival mass was observed on the buccal mucosa adjacent to the maxillary right first and second molars which were severely carious. The maxillary right first and second molars exhibited class III mobility. Panoramic radiographic examination showed extensively carious maxillary right first and second molars, with associated periodical radiolucencies that extended apically into the right maxillary sinus as an opacified and well-delineated mass (Fig 1 ). Computed tomography showed erosion of periapical bone extending into the right maxillary sinus floor adjacent to the maxillary right first and second molars. The right ethmoid and right frontal sinuses also were opacified (Fig 2 ). The otolaryngology service performed endoscopic evaluation of the right paranasal sinuses because of concern for invasive fungal sinusitis. No obvious mucosal necrosis was found, although endoscopy did confirm some edematous and inflamed fibrous debris within the right maxillary sinus, which was thought to be secondary to an infected tooth. The maxillary right first and second molars were extracted under local anesthesia. At this time the decision was made to perform a biopsy to definitively diagnose the gingival mass (Fig 3 ). Microscopic examination showed an oral mucosa with extensive underlying diffuse infiltration, with medium to large cells exhibiting plasmacytic differentiation. There was a high degree of mitotic activity and abundant cellular debris present. Cytologically unremarkable plasma cells were seen underlying the squamous epithelium (Fig 4 ). Immunohistochemical examination also was performed with CD79a, CD20, CD3, PAX-5, KI-67, CD45, and in situ hybridization for ?, ?, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which showed atypical cells exhibiting the following immunophenotype: CD79a+, CD20 (minimally positive), CD3?, CD5?, CD138?, PAX-5?, BCL2+, CD10?, BCL6?, Ki-67 (= 90%), CD45+, in situ hybridization ?+, ??, and EBV+. The diagnosis was EBV+ PBL. Extraoral disease involvement was ruled out with positron emission tomography, transthoracic echocardiography, plain chest radiography, computed tomographic examination of the abdomen and pelvis, brain magnetic resonance imaging, bone marrow biopsy, and lumbar puncture. Subsequently, multiple specialists were recruited to manage AIDS and oral PBL. The patient was started on combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the form of Atripla (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) and began chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide (R-EPOCH) for PBL. Despite being initially responsive, the mass eventually progressed after 5 cycles of R-EPOCH. Next, rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (R-ICE) chemotherapy was used for refractory disease. After the second cycle of R-ICE and approximately 6 months from the initiation of chemotherapy, the mass continued to increase in size. At this point, roughly 7 months from diagnosis, a 40-day salvage radiotherapy course was administered for refractory oral PBL. After 5 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP), 2 cycles of R-ICE, and radiotherapy, abdominal nodules were discovered that were found to be consistent with recurrent PBL. The patient unfortunately succumbed to his disease 16 months after being diagnosed with PBL. "
2201,S0344-0338(07)00086-6,Pyothorax-associated lymphoma: A case showing transition from T-cell-rich polymorphic lesion to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma," Case report A 78-year-old man was diagnosed to have left pyothorax after complaining of chest pain and fever for about 2 months. He had a history of collapse therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis about 50 years ago. Four months later, malignant lymphoma of T-cell type was suspected by an open biopsy from a pleural tumor, which was formed in the postero-inferior part of the left pleural cavity. A flow cytometric analysis revealed the dominance of CD8-positive lymphocytes, but no rearrangements of T-cell receptors (TCR J?1, TCR J?1) were found. He was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including naproxen, and clinical symptoms were reduced. Two years and 7 months after the open biopsy, he began to complain of pain in the left back, where Ga scintigraphy revealed a high intensity. He was treated with a total of 12Gy of radiation and subsequent chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide and vincristine. Although the tumor tended to be smaller and the pain was reduced, he died of fungal sepsis about 3 years after the open biopsy. The serum antibodies for EBV before chemotherapy were as follows: VCA IgG was 1:640, VCA IgM was <10, and EBNA IgG was 1:320. At autopsy, the left pleural cavity was occupied by necrotic tumor tissues (Fig. 1 ). The lesion was almost confined to the pleural cavity, with focal invasion into the ipsilateral chest wall and diaphragm. There were no atypical lymphocytes in other organs, including the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. "
2203,S0021-9975(07)00020-5,Retrospective Study of 82 Cases of Canine Lymphoma in Austria based on the Working Formulation and Immunophenotyping," Materials and Methods  Tissue Samples These consisted of 82 tissue sections of lymph nodes from dogs with lymphoma, diagnosed between 1996 and 2004 at the Institute of Pathology and Forensic Veterinary Medicine of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna. The lymphoma cases came from the university's teaching hospital and from veterinary clinics in and around Vienna. All tissue samples originating from the university hospital were fixed in 7% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Of the 82 dogs, 31 were female, 46 male, and five of unknown sex. There were 57 dogs of 28 different breeds, 21 of mixed breed and four of unknown breed. The breeds most frequently represented were German shepherd (n=9), Rottweiler (n=6), cocker spaniel (n=5), bullmastiff (n=4) and Labrador retriever (n=4).   Histological Classification Slides were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) for histopathological examination. Lymphomas were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Working Formulation (Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Pathologic Classification Project, 1982; Carter et al., 1986). The macronucleolated medium-sized cell subtype was included in the intermediate-grade group (Fournel-Fleury et al., 1997). Classification was based on lymph node architecture (diffuse or follicular), mitotic rate (low, intermediate, high), and cell type. The cell type was defined on the basis of nuclear size and shape, number and location of nucleoli, and chromatin characteristics. The numbers of mitoses were recorded as low (0–2 per×400 field), medium (3–5) or high (>6) (Carter et al., 1986).   Immunohistochemical Labelling and Grading Phenotyping of lymphomas was performed with CD3 antibody (A452; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), to identify T-cells, and CD79a antibody (M7051, clone HM57; Dako) to identify B-cells. The avidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique was used. Wax sections were mounted on positively charged glass slides (Superfrost Plus; Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and dewaxing was carried out later. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides in citrated buffer solution (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating slides for 30min in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% sodium azide. The sections were then incubated with normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) at a dilution of 1 in 10 for 60min to block non-specific antibody interactions. Overnight incubation with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against CD3 (dilution 1 in 500) and monoclonal mouse antibody against CD79a (dilution 1 in 200) at 4°C followed. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the slides were incubated with a 1 in 200 dilution of the secondary biotinylated antibody (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit [Vector Laboratories]) for 30min. Vectastain Elite ABC (Vector Laboratories) was applied for 60min. The reaction was “visualized” with 3, 3?-diaminobenzidine (DAB Substrate Kit for Peroxidase; Vector Laboratories). The slides were then counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Between each step, the slides were washed with PBS. Tissue sections of normal canine lymph nodes were used as positive controls. The lymphomas were classified as either T-cell type (>60% of cells reacting with CD3 antibody) or B-cell type (>60% of cells reacting with CD79a antibody).  "

His exam was notable for severe weakness with left hip flexion, knee extension, and hallucis longus extension. His sensation, bowel, and bladder function were intact. His LE reflexes were diminished. CT showed bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), enlarged lymph nodes, and a retroperitoneal (RP) mass. MRI showed that the RP mass extended into the paraspinal muscles and spinal canal with encroachment of the thecal sac from the lumbar to sacral area. RP mass and bone marrow biopsies revealed a Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. The patient received 5 days of Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy. Patient was admitted to acute inpatient rehab immediately following chemotherapy at a level of maximum assistance with sit to stand and moderate assistance to walk 12 feet. "

2242,S0344-0338(07)00030-1,Expression of transmembrane adaptor protein PAG/Cbp in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Immunohistochemical study of 73 cases," Materials and methods The study group of DLBCL was selected from 155 consecutive cases classified as malignant lymphoma at Hematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds General Infirmary, UK, during January, May, and June 2006. Diagnoses were established according to the WHO classification of hematolymphoid malignancies using a standard immunohistochemical panel of antibodies and routine immunohistochemical procedures [13]. A CD10, bcl-6, MUM1 algorithm as published by Hans et al. [11] was used for subclassification of DLBCL into GC-like and non-GC-like types. PAG was detected by mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody MEM-255 donated by Prof. Horejsi. It was prepared from a mouse immunized with recombinant human PAG as described elsewhere [5]. The antibody reacts optimally with denatured PAG (under the conditions of Western blotting) irrespective of whether tyrosine phosphorylated or not. The dilution was 1:10, and the immunohistochemical reaction required an antigen retrieval step-heating in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 for 20min. The Universal LSAB+ Kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendation for visualization. MEM-255 reactivity was tested in hyperplastic lymph node tissue (Figs. 1 and 2  ). During routine diagnostic procedure, PAG expression was assessed as positive, with uniform strong expression in more than 90% of tumor cells (+), positive in a variable proportion (25–90%) of tumor cells (±), and negative (?). Only membranous positivity was considered as a positive MEM-255 reaction (Figs. 3–5   ). "
2245,S1092-9134(05)00216-9,A case of primary unilateral adrenal Burkitt-like large cell lymphoma presenting as adrenal insufficiency," 2 Case report An 80-year-old white man with previous radical prostatectomy for prostatic adenocarcinoma and gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease was seen in April 2003 for lower abdominal pain, anorexia, and cachexia. His medical problems included hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was found to have partial small intestinal obstruction on plain abdominal x-ray. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed an incidental homogenous soft tissue mass measuring 8 × 6.5 × 3 cm and entirely replacing left adrenal gland (Fig. 1 ). Five months later, his symptoms progressed to increased weakness, continued weight loss, and ambulatory difficulty. Physical examination revealed left abdominal tenderness, without palpable hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Initial laboratory studies revealed sodium level of 130 mmol/L (reference range, 133-150) and normal potassium and calcium levels. Intravenous gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant enlargement of left adrenal mass (12 × 11 × 9 cm), which demonstrated a homogenous signal intensity with minimal enhancement and no evidence of necrosis. Vanillylmandelic acid, metanephrine, and normetanephrine levels were normal, excluding primary adrenal medullary neoplasm. Dexamethasone suppression test was negative, excluding primary adrenal cortical neoplasm. Corticotropin (ACTH) level was 5 pg/mL (reference range, 6-48 pg/mL) and cortisol level was 5.2 ?g/dL (reference range, 3.1-16.66 ?g/dL). Thyrotropin level was 2.25 ?IU/mL (reference range, 0.35-5.5 ?IU/mL). Dihydroepiandrosterone level was less than 15 ?g/dL (reference range, 28-175 ?g/dL). Rapid cosyntropin stimulation test, using 250 ?g of intravenous cosyntropin (analog of ACTH), demonstrated plasma cortisol measurements of 10.8 and 6.74 ?g/dL at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. This incremental cortisol increase after cosyntropin injection was less than an adequate response of adrenal gland to cosyntropin stimulation (reference range, at least 7?g/dL at 0 minutes, 16 ?g/dL at 30 minutes, and 18 ?g/dL at 60 minutes poststimulation), strongly suggesting adrenal insufficiency.

2306,S1092-9134(05)00153-X,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast: a review of 18 primary and secondary cases," 2 Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed the pathology records of 18 patients with breast lymphoma at the University of Alabama at Birmingham between 1989 and 1999. For all patients, a tissue biopsy and/or resection were performed. Seven patients also had FNA. All available hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides from histologic sections and cytology slides were reviewed in conjunction with the original surgical pathology and/or cytopathology reports. For 7 patients, slides from histologic sections were not available for review, and the diagnosis was retrieved from the original pathology reports. All cases were reclassified according to the World Health Organization 2001 classification scheme for tumors of lymphoid tissues [24]. For the categorization of breast lymphoma into primary and secondary forms, we used the criteria originally developed by Wiseman and Liao [25] for PBL: (1) adequate pathological material, (2) close association of mammary tissue and malignant lymphomatous infiltrate, and (3) concurrent widespread disease or preceding extramammary lymphoma excluding ipsilateral axillary node involvement. Cases not fulfilling the latter criterion were designated as secondary. Immunophenotyping was performed on paraffin embedded tissue for most specimens at the time of the original diagnosis. For several consult cases, the referring institution performed and reported the results of immunophenotyping. Flow cytometric analysis in 7 patients, cytogenetic analysis in 3 patients, and electron microscopy in 1 patient were performed. "

2311,S0022-510X(14)00305-0,Primary natural killer/T-cell lymphoma presenting as leptomeningeal disease," 2 Case report The patient is a 68-year-old African–American woman with a history of breast cancer at the age of 58 who was under surveillance after undergoing lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and a 5-year course of adjuvant hormonal therapy. She presented with a 4-week history of intermittent slurred speech, gait instability, double vision, right-side hearing loss, difficulty writing, left arm weakness and an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Neurological examination revealed dysarthria; right hypoacusis; left hemiparesis; bilateral arm dysmetria; and ataxic gait. The findings of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast suggested LMD involving the cerebellar folia, superior vermis, and bilateral temporal lobes (Fig. 1A, B). Parenchymal enhancement was also noted within the posterior left medial temporal lobe and left superior temporal gyrus, which are noted to have parenchymal involvement in LMD (Fig. 1C). Thoracic and lumbosacral spine MRIs with and without contrast demonstrated a linear enhancement involving the posterior dura at the L2–L5 levels (Fig. 1D). Chest computed tomography, abdominal ultrasonography, and whole-body positron emission tomography imaging were negative for malignancy. Slit-lamp examination showed no evidence of intraocular lymphoma. CSF analysis revealed an elevated white blood cell count (49cell/?L, normal 0–5cell/?L), protein level (127mg/dL, normal 15–60mg/dL). CSF glucose level was 50mg/dL. CSF/serum glucose ratio was 0.3. CSF beta2-microglobulin level was significantly elevated (12.2mg/L, normal 0.70–1.80mg/L). CSF/serum beta2-microglobulin ratio was also elevated (6.1, normal 0.41–0.79). Cytologic examination of the CSF revealed numerous large atypical lymphoid cells admixed with small and medium-sized cells. The large lymphoid cells showed abundant pale cytoplasm containing azurophilic granules, irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and occasional mitotic figures (Fig. 1E, F, G). Flow cytometric immunophenotypic studies of the CSF showed that the large cells were positive for CD45 (bright), CD56, CD2, CD7, and CD8 and negative for surface CD3, CD5, CD64, CD14, CD34, and CD117, which is consistent with NK/T-cell lineage (more in favor of an NK-cell lineage over a T-cell lineage). The tumor cells accounted for about 75% to 90% of total cells, and there were very few B-cells, which were polytypic. Molecular analysis of the CSF using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction did not detect EBV DNA. Other CSF analyses for virus, bacteria and fungi were negative. Bone marrow biopsy revealed no morphologic, flow cytometric, or immunohistochemical evidence of B-, T- or NK-cell lymphoma or metastatic carcinoma. We subsequently treated the patient with systemic chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate, vincristine, and procarbazine. Clinical deterioration was observed 2days after initiation of the treatment, with bilateral hypoacusis and recurrent seizures. Brain MRI showed overall worsened LMD (Fig. 2H, I). However, 2days after the initial deterioration, the patient's overall condition improved, and repeat CSF studies showed normal chemistry and cell counts. Then, treatment with intrathecal free cytarabine through the Ommaya reservoir was initiated, along with continued systemic chemotherapy. As of date of this report, the patient had finished 5cycles of systemic chemotherapy, with high-dose methotrexate, vincristine and procarbazine, followed by 2cycles of high-dose cytarabine, along with weekly intrathecal methotrexate and free cytarabine. She continues to improve. A brain MRI with and without contrast 18weeks after the initiation of treatment showed significant recovery from LMD (Fig. 2J, K). CSF cytology remained negative for malignant cells and her neurological symptoms resolved. "

Previously, one of the authors of this paper (Z. K.) reported a case of systemic lymphoma presenting with periventricular dissemination [2]. In this case, the lymphoma cells were thought to enter into the brain thorough the choroid plexus, although choroid plexus involvement was not apparent on MRI [2]. Our new case supports the idea that lymphoma cells sometimes show choroid plexus infiltration and periventricular dissemination."
2325,S1040-8428(13)00260-6,Clinical manifestations in children with tonsillar lymphoma: A systematic review," 2 Materials and methods A systematic literature review was performed by searching databases at PubMed/Medline, LILACS, IBECS, Cochrane, SCIELO, BIREME and Scopus. The research covered articles in English, Spanish and Portuguese, related to tonsillar lymphoma in children from January 1996 until June 2012. The year of 1996 was chosen to simplify the search because there were only a few articles written before this year and most of them were not available on the Internet. The MeSH terms and free text words used were “tonsillar lymphoma and children.” Only two authors were responsible for selecting all the articles that had been completely read. The inclusion of these articles was reviewed by the two authors. Articles and case reports were included covering the pediatric age group, considered up to 18 years old that contained information of the clinical manifestations of tonsillar lymphoma at diagnosis. Review articles without description of clinical cases, and those that did not clearly define the presence or absence of tonsillar lymphoma for each patient were excluded. Only the cases of lymphoma that were confirmed by histopathological examination were included. Considering that TP lymphoma in children is a rare condition, all case reports matching our criteria were included to increase the sample size and to avoid the loss of any potentially important information. The evaluated data of the articles were: number of cases of PT lymphoma, gender, age, type of study, unilateral tonsillar enlargement, altered mucosa, fever, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, dysphagia, immunosuppression, previous radiotherapy, symptoms of snoring or apnea, type of lymphoma, also considered was the origin of the article, authors, year of publication, and other information considered relevant by the authors (local pain, voice alteration, treatment of acute bacterial tonsillitis without improvement and auricular fullness). During the evaluation of reported information in the articles clinical manifestations not mentioned were considered absent. "

He denied fever, chills, night sweats or weight loss. His medical history was significant for VIH (stage B3). Physical examination revealed a 3 × 4 cm pink-withe, ulcerated, exophytic lesion involving the left half of the dorsal surface of the tongue. Biopsy sample of the lesion showed atypical neoplastic infiltrates of plasmocytoid cells with abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Inmunostaining was negative for CD2O, CD3, HHV8, BCL2, BCL6 and positive for CD38, CD138, EBER, MUM1. These finding were consistent with a diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were done, and these confirmed infiltration of bone marrow (stage IV-A). CT imaging of the brain, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis didn't show lymph node involvement. The patient was transferred to the oncology service and treated with EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin) in association with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy).

[2], in combination with a conventional clustering method, namely the k-means, to derive the decision rule for classifying 79 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas [7]. The classification was based on the immunohistochemical expression values of the proliferation-associated proteins (variables) Ki67, cyclin A and cyclin B1 [5].   2.2 Growing the classification tree In the classification tree method, the individual cases are sorted for each measured variable  (   x   i   ) . Then the variable with the splitting point which best discriminates between the classes that the cases belong, is chosen. Afterwards, the initial set of cases is split into two subsets and the two subsets are partitioned independently. The above process is repeated recursively. The algorithm can be presented as a tree structure. If  t  is the node representing the initial set of cases then the algorithm splits  t  into two subsets (sub-nodes)    t   L    and    t   R    in such a way that the sub-nodes are purer (a node is maximally pure when it contains cases from only one class) than the parent node  t . Then a portion    p   L    of individual cases in  t  goes to    t   L    and a portion    p   R    goes to    t   R   . If the splitting variable is    x   k     ( k = 1 - 3 )  and the splitting point is  s , then    t   L    contains all the individuals which have values of    x   k    less than  s  and    t   R    contains the remainder. The goodness of split is defined by the increase in purity DI ( s )  due to split  s : DI ( s ) = I ( t ) -   p   L   I (   t   L   ) -   p   R   I (   t   R   ) , where  I ( t ) = 1 -   ?   j     p   2   ( j / t )  and  p ( j / t )  is the proportion of individuals of class  j  in node  t  [3]. After each split, classes are assigned to the new nodes using the majority rule. The growth of the tree is determined by the improvement (threshold value) in the AMR (the proportion of misclassified individuals to their classes using resubstitution) after each split [2].   2.3 Decision rule Based on the splitting variables and the corresponding splitting points, we can derive a decision rule for determining groups of cases according to the degree of proliferation of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.   2.4 Class specification Prior to the classification tree analysis, a clustering method [10], namely the k-means clustering, was applied to the data in order to identify clusters of individuals. K-means clustering starts with  k  random clusters and then moves cases between those clusters to: (i) minimize variability within clusters and (ii) maximize variability between clusters. Then these clusters were declared as classes, i.e. a seed, applicable for the classification tree analysis. The classification tree was applied to these declared classes for various thresholds of improvement in AMR. Then, the split point values at the branch nodes were recorded providing a decision tool for characterizing groups of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with low and high proliferation profiles. The terminal nodes consisted of groups of individual cases with a certain proliferation profile of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.   2.5 Computer implementation The classification tree algorithm was implemented as a C program with a Windows interface. The program generates a graphical output (the resulting tree), which is displayed on the screen or exported as a postscript file. The software is available by the corresponding author upon request.

2332,S2214-7519(14)00027-9,Primary central nervous system lymphoma presenting as isolated oculomotor nerve palsy," Case report  History and examination This 42year-old male presented with sudden obscuration of his vision due to an inability to lift his right eyelid. On manual elevation of the right eyelid, his partner noticed that his right pupil was significantly larger than the left, a previously absent finding. The patient also complained of double vision. This was on a background of intermittent headaches, nausea and vomiting over the preceding two months. He denied any preceding trauma and any upper or lower limb neurological symptoms. He had no significant past medical history and did not take any regular medications. On examination, his right eyelid was partially ptosed. The right pupil was dilated (8mm) compared to the left (5mm). Direct and consensual pupillary light reflexes were sluggish on the right compared to the left. Adduction, elevation and depression of the right eye were impaired, while abduction and intorsion was intact. Visual acuity was 6/6 bilaterally and there were no abnormalities seen on fundoscopy and perimetry testing for visual field defects. The remainder of the cranial nerve and neurological exam was unremarkable. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy.   Investigation and diagnosis Given the pupil-involved ONP, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the brain were performed. No saccular aneurysms were identified on CTA. On contrast-enhanced CT and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a leptomeningeal nodular and irregular enhancement encasing the midbrain involving the interpeduncular cistern was demonstrated. Additionally, a T1-isointense, T2-isointense hypothalamic lesion measuring 12mm×11mm×11mm was noted. This lesion was homogeneously-enhancing with intravenous gadolinium contrast. A further intraventricular lesion centred on the septum pellucidum with similar MRI characteristics was identified together with widespread irregular ependymal enhancement of the fourth ventricle and bilateral foramen of Luschka (Fig. 1 ). There was no hydrocephalus and contrast-enhanced MRI of the spine was normal without leptomeningeal or intramedullary involvement. A working diagnosis of CNS lymphoma was made and the haematology department at the institution was consulted. Further investigations were conducted to confirm and determine the extent of PCNSL. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis via lumbar puncture revealed a cell count of 2×106/L erythrocytes and 93×106/L leukocytes comprising 86% lymphocytes and 14% polymorphs. CSF protein was elevated (1.22g/L) and glucose concentration was at the lower range of normal (2.7mmol/L). CSF cytology and flow cytometry was not suggestive of lymphoma. The serum full blood and white cell differential count, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody test, hormonal panel, serum lactate dehydrogenase and testicular ultrasound were normal. CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow aspirate and trephine (BMAT) did not reveal lymphomatous infiltration. An image-guided, endoscopic intraventricular biopsy was undertaken via a left frontal burrhole. At operation, extensive grey-white tumour lining the lateral ventricles bilaterally across the septum pellucidum was visualized and biopsied. Histopathological examination revealed sheets of atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm of lymphoid origin. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for CD20 and mildly positive for CD3 (Fig. 2 ). A definitive diagnosis of PCNSL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtype) was made. Post histopathological diagnosis, an Ommaya reservoir was inserted.   Management and clinical progress The patient recovered well postoperatively and was commenced on combination chemotherapy by the haematology department. The protocol consisted of five 14-day cycles of R-MPV (Rituximab, Methotrexate, Procarbazine, Vincristine) with intra-Ommaya methotrexate between cycles [2]. The patient completed chemotherapy without major side effects, with resolution of his ONP. Post-chemotherapy brain MRI three months post-diagnosis demonstrated complete disease remission (Fig. 1). Given the patient’s relatively young age and good performance status, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) followed by high-dose cytarabine will be instituted with curative intent.  "
2334,S0399-077X(18)30032-5,Recurrent Enterococcus faecalis meningitis in a patient presenting with Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome during HTLV-1-induced T-cell lymphoma," 2 Case report A 38-year-old pregnant woman presented after 31 weeks of gestation with a rapidly progressive cervical tumor responsible from dyspnea, weight loss, and asthenia. She had a history of peritonitis secondary to appendicitis and iatrogenic hepatitis induced by penicillin, tazocilline, and vancomycin. She was native to Guinea but had not been back for 15 years. A cervical biopsy confirmed a clonal peripheral T-cell lymphoproliferation. HTLV-1 serology was positive. Corticosteroids at 2mg/kg/day were introduced as the tumor progression threatened the upper respiratory tract. Labor was initiated at 32 weeks of gestation to start a first-line chemotherapy. Despite chemotherapy, the tumor kept on invading the larynx. The patient underwent debulking surgery and a second-line chemotherapy regimen was then administered combined with an antiviral therapy, including zidovudine (600mg/day) and interferon (3MIU/day). Disease progression was temporarily stable on the second-line treatment regimen combined with cervical radiotherapy. One week after the second-line treatment initiation, the patient presented with fever and was subsequently diagnosed with Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia. Vancomycin was initiated because of an allergy to amoxicillin (with residual serum concentrations?10mg/L). One week after the first positive blood culture, confusion and fever were observed. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 10 white blood cells (WBC)/mm3, 5 red blood cells (RBC)/mm3, and cultures were positive for E. faecalis. Levofloxacin (500mg twice daily) was added to the treatment regimen for a total duration of two weeks. Two weeks after antibiotic therapy completion, the patient was newly admitted to our unit for fever and encephalitis. A lumbar puncture revealed E. faecalis meningitis with the same antimicrobial susceptibility results. She was treated with amoxicillin (12g/day) and linezolid (600mg twice daily) for three weeks. An echocardiography was performed and contributed to ruling out infective endocarditis. Following six days of antimicrobial treatment, a second lumbar puncture was performed and indicated 300RBC/mm3 and a decreasing number of WBC (4/mm3). A gastroscopy was also carried out to explore an intense gastroduodenal hypermetabolism, which had been previously identified by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The gastroduodenal biopsy showed mucosal invasion with Strongyloides stercoralis and serology was positive on two blood samples. Yet, the parasite was not isolated from stool cultures and the patient did not present with eosinophilia during the follow-up period. Evaluation before corticosteroid prescription was not performed because the patient had not been to an endemic area for several years. She was then treated with two doses of ivermectin 15 days apart (total dose of 9mg). Following adequate treatment of meningitis and S. stercoralis, a third-line chemotherapy was initiated for the refractory T-cell lymphoma. During this interval, the patient did not present with any new infectious event. Despite stabilization of infectious conditions and a good partial response, she died seven months after T-cell lymphoma diagnosis as a result of a secondary refractory status epilepticus. "

2338,S1726-4901(14)00097-5,"Intraocular involvement of T-cell lymphoma presenting as inflammatory glaucoma, neurotrophic keratopathy, and choroidal detachment"," 2 Case Report An 81-year-old male was referred under the diagnosis of inflammatory glaucoma. He had underlying diseases of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and membranous glomerulonephritis. We examined the patient 2 days after he used 1% prednisolone QID. The best corrected visual acuity was 6/6.7 OD and 6/6 OS; the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 20 mmHg OD and 28 mmHg OS. Slit-lamp examinations showed cells in the anterior chamber and multiple fine keratic precipitates (KPs) in the left eye (Fig. 1 A). Other examinations including those of the pupil, vitreous, and retina were normal. The frequency of topical 1% prednisolone increased to every 2 hours, and topical 0.5% timolol was added. The anterior chamber inflammation persisted, and the intraocular pressure fluctuated. At the 1 month follow-up after presentation, the best corrected visual acuity had deteriorated to 6/60 OS. Slit-lamp examinations of the left eye revealed an increase of KPs, a very deep anterior chamber, and a fixed, large dilated pupil. The patient denied using any cycloplegic eye drops. Aqueous tapping was done and sent for polymerase chain reaction analyses of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. The results were all negative. Four days later, nearly total corneal epithelial defect with stromal edema and a decrease in corneal sensation OS were observed (Fig. 1B). The anterior chamber remained very deep. Fundoscopy revealed choroidal detachment. The vitreous and retina could not be seen clearly because of corneal edema and hazy media. No obvious retinal infiltration patch could be observed. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed a marked increase in the anterior chamber depth, signal enhancement of the ciliary body, and fluid accumulation in the suprachoroidal space in the left eye (Fig. 2 ). The epithelial defect and choroidal detachment persisted despite the application of a therapeutic contact lens, tarsorrhaphy, and oral plus peribulbar injection of corticosteroids. Diagnostic vitrectomy was then performed, and cytology showed medium- to large-sized lymphoid cells with pleomorphic nuclei, suggesting malignant lymphoma (Fig. 3 A). On the 2nd day after vitrectomy, the patient complained of epigastralgia. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, which revealed a large ulcer at the stomach. Because malignancy was suspected, a biopsy was performed; pathological results were consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma that stained positively for CD3 and leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and negatively for cytokeratin (CK), L26, and CD20 (Fig. 3B–E). However, further systemic survey of the patient did not reveal tumor involvement of other organs. Arrangements were then made for the patient to undergo chemotherapy. Unfortunately, he expired 10 days after starting the treatment due to massive gastric bleeding and multiple organ failure. "
2345,S0046-8177(14)00089-6,Low-grade B-cell lymphoma presenting primarily in the bone marrow," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Patient selection The pathology database at our institution was searched for cases of low-grade B-cell lymphoma involving the bone marrow from January 2000 to December 2011. A total of 199 patient samples of bone marrow were retrieved. From them, cases of mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, aggressive B-cell lymphoma, or acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia as well as cases presenting with lymph node swelling, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, any mass detectable by physical examination or computed tomography (CT), or bone changes detected by CT were excluded. Furthermore, among the patients who underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT, those who exhibited a high standardized uptake value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose outside the bone marrow were excluded. All patients in the present study underwent thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT scanning. Diagnoses were made according to the current World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification [7]. In the present study, cases of low-grade B-cell lymphoma that did not meet any classification criteria according to the WHO classification were considered as low-grade B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (LGBCL-NOS). Multiple myeloma was ruled out by using the International Myeloma Working Group criteria [8]. CD20-positive multiple myeloma was also ruled out based on the presence of certain clinical features such as the absence of lytic bone lesions on CT as well as CD19 positivity [9] and cyclin D1 negativity on immunohistochemistry [10]. B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma were ruled out based on the findings of histopathology and immunostaining of TdT and MIC2. B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia was ruled out based on the findings of a peripheral blood smear. Hairy cell leukemia was ruled out based on the presence of AnnexinA1 negativity by immunostaining and CD103 positivity by flow cytometry. Hairy cell leukemia variant and splenic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia unclassifiable were ruled out based on the findings of flow cytometry and presence of splenomegaly. A total of 14 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of the 14 patients, bone marrow biopsy findings were available in 7 patients, and clot section findings were available in the other 7 patients. The major differential diagnostic points between CLL/SLL and LGBCL-NOS are described as follows. First, clinically, the patients who had elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts generally had CLL/SLL; these cases were excluded for the diagnosis of LGBCL-NOS. Second, histologically, the case that presented with monotonous cells with a condensed nucleus and partial presence of paraimmunoblasts was included among the CLL/SLL cases. Third, CD5- and CD23-positive cases, identified using immunohistochemical study or flow cytometry, were also included among the CLL/SLL cases and excluded for the diagnosis of LGBCL-NOS. Most patients with LPL had IgM paraproteinemia. Histologically, tumor cells in LPL are predominantly small lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and plasmacytoid cells. Patients who presented with these clinical manifestations and histologic characteristics were excluded for the diagnosis of LGBCL-NOS. We used the term LGBCL-NOS for cases that did not meet any WHO criteria because they could not be further subtyped. Bone marrow aspirate cytology was available in 12 patients. Other clinical data were collected, including blood cell counts, serum biochemistry, including the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2-R), and M protein type. Survival outcomes were also examined. The invasion pattern of the bone marrow was evaluated according to the criteria proposed by Arber and George [1]. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Okayama University, Okayama, Japan, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. All study procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.   2.2 Flow cytometric analysis Flow cytometric analysis was performed on 13 samples obtained from either bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood using a single-tube, 2-color method as described previously [11]. Monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD5, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, and Ig? and Ig? light chains were used. The data were acquired on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).   2.3 Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 10% formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Automated immunostainers (Ventana Medical System, Tucson, AZ) (BOND-MAX; Leica Microsystems, Melbourne, Australia) [12] were used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The following primary antibodies were used (clone, dilution; source): CD20 (L26, 1:200; Dako, Carpentaria, CA), CD3 (LN10, 1:200; Leica Microsystems), CD5 (4C7, 1:100; Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), CD10 (56C6, 1:100; Novocastra), BCL-2 (3.1, 1:400; Novocastra), CD21 (1F8, 1:20; Dako), CD23 (1B12, 1:100; Novocastra), cyclin D1 (SP4, 1:50; Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan), CD19 (LE-CD19, 1:50; Dako), CD138 (MI15, 1:100; Dako), B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) (PG-B6P, 1:100; Dako), multiple myeloma oncogene 1 (MUM1) (MUM1p, 1:50; Dako), AnnexinA1 (rabbit polyclonal to AnnexinA1, 1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and Ki-67 (MIB-1, 1: 10000; Novocastra). After immunostaining, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD10, BCL-2, CD23, cyclin D1, CD19, CD138, BCL-6, and AnnexinA1 were scored quantitatively as negative, partially positive (ie, <30% positive tumor cells), or positive (ie, >30% positive tumor cells). Cells were considered MUM1 positive if they exhibited more than 30% positivity for MUM1. Furthermore, the Ki-67 index was determined; it was considered low and high at less than 10% and more than 10%, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for immunoglobulin heavy locus (IgH)/BCL-2 rearrangement t(14;18) was performed using a commercially available FISH probe set (Abbott Molecular, Wiesbaden, Germany) [13] on paraffin blocks available from patients 9 to 14. FISH analysis for API2/MALT1 t(11; 18)(q21; q21) was also performed for LPL and LGBCL-NOS patients using a commercially available FISH probe set (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) [14]. FISH analysis for IRF4 gene translocation was also performed for immunohistochemically MUM1-positive samples using a commercially available FISH probe set (KREATECH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) [15].   2.4 Screening for the myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) leucine to proline (L265P) mutations DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the QIAmp system (Qiagen; Venlo, Netherlands). Myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MYD88) genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward and reverse primers that were used for MYD88 were 5?-GTTGAAGACTGGGCTTGTCC-3? and 5?-GTGCAGGGGTTGGTGTAGTC-3?, respectively. The purified PCR products were directly sequenced in both directions using the BigDye (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Chicago, IL) Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and analyzed on an automatic 3500 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA).   2.5  IgVH sequence analysis Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was detected by PCR. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were amplified by using seminested PCR, with the primers directed to the framework 2 region (FR2A: 5?-TGGRTCCGMCAGSCYYCNGG-3? for both the first and second PCR) and the joining region (LJH: 5?-TGAGGAGACGGTGACC-3? for the first PCR and VLJH: 5?-GTGACCAGGGTNCCTTGGCCCCAG-3? for the second PCR). DNA samples were separately subjected to PCR with TAKARA Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). The amplified products were electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel. A product was determined to be “clonal” if a single or dominant discrete band was apparent. To sequence clonal bands, the PCR products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (USB; Affymetrix, USB, Cleveland, OH). Sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (AB, Warrington, UK), and the reaction products were analyzed on an automatic 3130xl DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions (VH) regions were compared with deposited sequences using the IgBLAST database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/) in the PubMed Center.

2396,S0008-4182(18)30555-6,Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with orbital involvement,"  Case Presentation  A 14-year-old Caucasian female had no significant past medical history until she presented with a 3-month history of painless right lower eyelid swelling. She was initially treated with oral antibiotics and a methylprednisolone dose pack for presumed orbital cellulitis. Significant improvement was noted within 1 week. One month later, the right lower lid edema recurred with proptosis of the right side (Fig. 1 A). The patient denied weight loss, fever, night sweats, pruritus, or other systemic symptoms. There was no history of trauma or infection. Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes (OU). OD colour vision was reduced to 15/17 Ishihara colour plates, while OS colour vision was intact. Intraocular pressure was 13 mm Hg OU. Extraocular movements were significant for restriction in abduction (70%) and depression (80%) OD and were normal, without pain or restriction OS. The eyes were orthophoric. Anisocoria was noted, with OD measuring 6 mm and OS measuring 3 mm. The anisocoria was found to be more prominent in the dark. Both pupils were reactive without an afferent pupillary defect. Anterior segment examination OD was significant for lower eyelid edema and proptosis. No salmon patch was present. Anterior segment examination OS was significant for left upper eyelid ptosis. The constellation of left upper eyelid ptosis and left miotic pupil were consistent with Horner's syndrome. Fundoscopic examination was significant for grade-2 optic nerve edema OU with blurring of the optic disc margin, hyperemia, and obscuration of vasculature (Fig. 1B,C). There was no hemorrhage or optic disc pallor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits was significant for an enhancing right orbital mass and a right sphenotemporal buttress lesion with extension into the middle cranial fossa (Fig. 2 A,B). MRI of the chest was significant for a mediastinal mass and an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node, which was the likely cause of her left-sided Horner's syndrome. A biopsy was taken of a supraclavicular lymph node. Histopathologic analysis revealed atypical large cells that stained positive for CD15, CD30, and fascin, along with eosinophils and Reed-Sternberg cells (Fig. 3 A–F). With consideration of the clinical, radiographic, and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of nodular sclerosing type HL was made. The patient did not undergo testing for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It should be noted that the patient denied a family history of nodular sclerosing type HL. The patient was treated with a chemotherapy regimen consisting of adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Upon follow-up 7 weeks later, the right-sided proptosis and lower eyelid edema resolved (Fig. 1D). MRI of the brain and orbits at this time revealed significant regression of the right orbital and middle cranial fossa lesions (Fig. 2C,D). Ten months after initial diagnosis, the patient remains in remission with stable regression of the right orbital and sphenotemporal buttress lesions. "

2413,S1477-6804(04)00046-9,Spontaneous gastrosplenic fistula in primary gastric lymphoma: case report and review of literature," Discussion The first gastrosplenic fistula was reported from Belgium in 1962. The authors described a case of gastrosplenic fistula with a characteristic radiographic appearance due to the presence of air in the spleen, which they termed “aerosplenomegaly”. 12  There have been 12 reported cases of gastrosplenic fistula in the literature, of which 7 were neoplastic, 2–5,9,12,14  4 resulted from perforation of benign gastric ulcers 13  and 1 from gastric Crohn's disease. 1  Among the neoplastic causes of gastrosplenic fistula, lymphoma was the underlying malignancy in 5 cases, of which 4 primaries were in the spleen and 1 in the stomach. 3  Lymphosarcoma and adenocarcinoma of the stomach were found in the remaining 2 cases. 2–5,9,12  Fistulation followed chemotherapy in 4 cases 2,3,5  and was spontaneous in 3 cases, but in the latter the spleen was the primary site of origin of the tumour. 4,9  Ours is probably the first reported case of spontaneous fistulation from a primary gastric lymphoma.  Pathogenesis Splenic penetration by benign gastric ulcers is divided into early penetration characterized by inflammatory reaction around a confined perforation which invades the spleen, and advanced penetration in which the ulcer crater extends into the splenic parenchyma. This latter type is termed a gastrosplenic fistula. 7  No such categories have been suggested in the literature for penetration by malignant lesions. Gastrosplenic fistulas can arise from various underlying malignancies, such as adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. However, fistulation in general is more common in lymphoma than in adenocarcinoma because of the absence of a desmoplastic reaction. 2,11  In the abdomen, lymphomas are of the histiocytic or large-cell diffuse type and are seen in the stomach more commonly (56%) than in the spleen. In general such lymphomas are more aggressive and require chemoradiation 8–10  which may hasten the process of tumour lysis and contribute to the formation of the fistulous tract because of loss of tumour tissue or acute tumour lysis syndrome following therapy. 2,3   Of the splenic lymphomas, those associated with splenomegaly and central necrosis have a higher tendency to adhere to and fistulate into other organs. A study of gastrointestinal tract lymphomas by Rosenfelt et al. revealed treatment-related bleeding and perforation as a complication in 25% of cases that failed to enter complete remission. 10  Spontaneous tumour necrosis is not common, and if it does occur it is usually in the terminal stage of the disease or in individuals with disseminated disease who are not evaluated further. 5  An autopsy study of 323 persons with untreated gastrointestinal lymphomas revealed gastric lesions in 128. In only 2 cases was fistulation noted, emphasizing the rarity of the condition even at postmortem. 11     Presentation Left upper quadrant pain is the most commonly described presentation of gastrosplenic fistulas, as in our case. 2,4,5,9  A review of 10 cases of large-cell lymphoma of the spleen by Harris et al. in 1984 showed 9 of the 10 patients to be over 50 years of age and presenting with left upper quadrant pain at the time of diagnosis. In this series 1 case was found to have a gastric fistula. 9  By means of erosion of the splenic artery, these gastrosplenic fistulas can present as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 14     Diagnosis In recent years CT has been the imaging technique by which most fistulas are diagnosed. 2–7  The classical finding is the presence of oral contrast medium in the spleen, as shown in Fig. 1. On non-contrasted CT, the presence of an air/fluid level within the spleen should raise suspicion of a fistula. The site of the air/fluid level may correspond to the site of primary splenic lesion. 5  Homogeneous hypodense lesions noted in the spleen could represent areas of splenic infarction due to involvement of the splenic artery by the gastric tumour. They can also be due to haematoma, liquefaction of splenic tissue after penetration or metastasis to the spleen. 5  Specific signs of penetration of the spleen are the loss of fascial planes and soft-tissue densities extending between the two organs. In a report by Glick et al. on preoperative recognition by CT of splenic penetration by benign gastric ulcer, 7  a low-density linear area within these soft-tissue densities was presumed to represent the fistulous tract. The role of upper gastrointestinal barium studies in these patients is limited, because lesions penetrating into surrounding structures may give a misleading radiographic image due to the fibrous reaction stimulated by penetration. 13   Endoscopy may reveal the gastric lesion as an ulcerated cavity on the greater curvature, a direct communication or gastric folds converging on the greater curvature with bright red central oozing. 4  In 1 case based on endoscopic findings of a fistula, an endoscope was passed into the splenic pulp and the lining of the fistula was noted to consist of necrotic material. 2  Caution has to be exercised in obtaining a biopsy of a mass in the walls of such lesions, as the mass could represent a splenic haematoma. Therefore CT before the endoscopy and biopsy may be of value to the endoscopist.   Management Surgery must be the method of management of gastrosplenic fistula because of the possibility of erosion into the splenic artery leading to catastrophic bleeding. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of management of the underlying lymphoma. Delayed surgical intervention was, however, successful in 1 case where the patient was followed up by outpatient endoscopy and later underwent operation after the closure of the fistula. 3  Patients presenting with bleeding may undergo splenic artery embolization followed by splenectomy and gastric resection. 14    "
2424,S2352-5126(15)00069-7,Development of a reticular rash in a febrile woman: An unusual cutaneous presentation of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma," Case report A 59-year-old woman presented with a week-long history of progressive, pruritic, pink, and lacy patches on her trunk and extremities. Upon closer inspection, physical examination revealed generalized erythematous papules, macules, and patches in a netlike, reticular pattern on her chest, abdomen, back, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Fig 1 ). Lesions exhibited blanching with pressure but no scaling. Mucosal surfaces were spared. Other concerns for this patient included fever, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and hypotension. Laboratory values were notable for elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated white blood cell count, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. In addition, computed tomography imaging demonstrated worsening cervical, axillary, mediastinal, hilar, retroperitoneal, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient had recently been admitted for recurrent pericardial effusions and pneumonia, but no antibiotics had been introduced within 2 weeks. Biopsy specimen from the center of a lesion revealed dense, angulated, and small to medium lymphocytic infiltrates, showing a pronounced angiocentric pattern and syringocentricity (Fig 2 , A). Small to medium vascular structures were involved and were effaced by the infiltrate (Fig 2, B). Atypical lymphocytes lined the dermoepidermal junction and exhibited epidermotropism in a mycosis fungoides-like pattern. With further immunohistology staining, the infiltrate was found to be overwhelmingly reactive for CD4, CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7, focally reactive for CD8, and rarely positive for CD20. CD34 revealed effaced vessels within the dense lymphoid infiltrate. Ultimately, a diagnosis of AITL was confirmed on skin and node biopsy specimens. The patient's course was complicated by recurrent pericardial effusions and multiple admissions for fever, attributed to both disease progress and pneumonia. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, prednisone; ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide; gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin; brentuximab; and romidepsin. Weeks later, the patient developed sepsis secondary to Clostridium difficile infection. After worsening hypotension and subsequent cardiopulmonary arrest, she died. "
2435,S1871-4048(14)00035-5,Subglottic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presenting as biphasic stridor," 2 Case report CR is a previously healthy 4 year-old male who presented with 1½ week history of progressively worsening noisy breathing and dyspnea on exertion. He was treated at an urgent care center with inhaled albuterol without any improvement. He was seen by an otolaryngologist and an in-office flexible laryngoscopy was performed and a “left vocal cord granuloma” was noted. Patient was started on oral steroid, and transferred to our institution for further management. On admission, he had an impressive biphasic stridor with even mild physical activity without significant respiratory distress. Patient underwent direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy under general anesthesia followed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, neck and chest. Direct laryngoscopy revealed a large amorphous submucosal mass in the left postero-lateral aspect of the subglottic airway which caused approximately 75% obstruction (Fig. 1 ). MRI showed a “moderate focal subglottic tracheal narrowing” extending from the level of the vocal cords down 42mm in length without Gadolinium enhancement (Fig. 2 ). Various services were consulted and differential diagnosis included Wegener's granulomatosis, ectopic thyroid tissue, benign or malignant neoplasm. Given the critical subglottic stenosis, we proposed an open resection of the lesion in order to address both the airway obstruction and to obtain tissue for diagnosis. Initially biopsy was performed endoscopically and patient was kept spontaneously ventilating and tissue was sent for frozen section. Intra-operative pathologic consultation was non-diagnostic with “chronic and acute inflammation.” Since the subglottic mass was rather soft and compressible, a small endotracheal tube was passed through the level of obstruction and patient was ventilated through it while the neck was prepped and draped. An anterior laryngofissure was created from the inferior edge of the anterior commissure down to the level of the third tracheal ring. The lesion occupied significant length of the tracheal wall posteriorly to the left side and the widest dimension was approximately 5mm at the level of the inferior edge of the cricoid. The lesion was removed to the level of fairly normal appearing mucosa although the border between the mass and the normal mucosal lining was very indistinct. A 28mm cartilaginous rib graft was harvested and grafted anteriorly for airway expansion. Postoperatively patient was intubated and monitored closely in the intensive care unit and was taken back to the operating room for diagnostic endoscopy and extubation on postop day 6 (Fig. 3 ). Final pathology revealed the lesion to be anaplastic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (CD30+, ALK1?) (Fig. 4 ). Re-examination of the first specimen on permanent section revealed only a small portion of cells consistent with lymphoma. Additional staging studies including CT of the chest and abdomen, bone marrow aspiration and diagnostic lumbar puncture were all negative, confirming stage IE. Due to uncertainty regarding margins, resection was presumed to be incomplete. Patient did well and was discharged home with stable airway and resolution of his stridor on postop day 11. The patient was admitted 1 month postop for cycle 1 of induction chemotherapy based on the regimen LMB96 group B [1]. Given absence of bulky disease we elected to eliminate the pre-phase and started therapy with COPADM (Cytoxan, vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and methotrexate, see Table 1 ). Intra-thecal chemotherapy was administered per protocol and G-CSF was administered between cycles to facilitate neutrophil recovery. Response assessment was with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, as he had no imageable disease at time of treatment initiation. He completed three additional cycles of treatment for a total duration of therapy of approximately 3 months. Surveillance bronchoscopy was performed at the completion of treatment and showed a total response. Endoscopies were performed every 3 months for 12 months and revealed the airway to be entirely clear of any residual disease (Fig. 5 ). "

A chest X-ray (Fig. 1 A) showed a huge heart with a water bottle sign. Cardiac echo and positron emission tomography scan (Fig. 1C–F) showed tumors involving the anterior mediastinum, thoracic cavity, stomach (Fig. 1E, arrow), and bilateral adrenal glands (Fig. 1F, arrow). Serology tests showed an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (387 IU/L), ?-HCG (10.02 mIU/mL), CA-125 (298.07 U/mL), tissue polypeptide antigen (386.03 U/mL), but normal ?2-microglobulin (160 ?g/dL) and AFP (2.88 ng/mL). He received computed tomography-guided right adrenal gland biopsy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy for tissue proof instead of anterior mediastinal mass. Both the pathology of the adrenal gland and gastric lesion showed an infiltration of large neoplastic B cells compartmentalized by fine delicate bands of fibrosis, and immunohistochemistry was positive for CD20 and LCA (leukocyte common antigen), and negative for CK and CD3. PMLBCL with multiple organs' (heart, stomach, and bilateral adrenal glands) involvement was diagnosed. The patient accepted chemotherapy with an R-CHOP regimen. After six courses of chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved with disappearance of the mediastinal mass on chest X-ray (Fig. 1B) and normalized tumor markers."
2456,S2152-2650(14)00180-3,Lymphoma Presenting as Secondary HLH: A Review With a Tale of Two Cases," Introduction Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening disease associated with an overwhelming cytokine storm and severe inflammation. Although genetic mutations resulting in primary HLH are the most common cause in the pediatric population, adults often present with HLH secondary to infection, autoimmune disease, or malignancy. Among the secondary causes, lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (LAHS), usually of the peripheral T-cell or Natural Killer (NK)-cell lineages is the most common and confers the poorest survival. Identification of this underlying secondary cause in adults often carries a significant diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma requiring the highest degree of clinical suspicion and awareness because it greatly affects patient outcome. Here we present 2 cases of LAHS that portend the atypical presentation and clinical dilemma associated with this disease, followed by a review and suggestions on a therapeutic approach. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, also called hemophagocytic syndrome is a rare, heterogeneous life-threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled activation of the normal immune system causing an overwhelming cytokine storm and severe inflammation. 1  Although well-defined clinical criteria have been established, its rarity and extremely variable presentation often delay the diagnosis and timely management resulting in overall poor survival. It is most commonly associated with persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or hypofibrinogenemia, hemocytopenia, and hemophagocytosis. Primary HLH is characterized by a known family history or genetic mutations, most commonly affecting the pediatric population, usually infants younger than 18 months of age. 2,3  Several genetic mutations have been identified in primary HLH and it most commonly affects the perforin gene (PRF1). Incidence is estimated at 1.2 cases per 50,000 births. 4  Although several genetic mutations have been identified in primary HLH, 5 distinct variants account for > 90% of the cases (unidentified gene defect, PRF1, UNC13D, Syntaxin 11 [STX11], Syntaxin Binding Protein-2 [STXBP-2]). 5  Similar mutations have been described in adult-onset clinical HLH patients, however a secondary trigger such as infection, autoimmune disease, or malignancy can be identified in most of these patients, hence, most adult cases are grouped in a category of secondary HLH. 6  Delay or failure to recognize the underlying etiology can have devastating consequences, because secondary causes can affect treatment decisions and survival. Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome is a relatively well-described subtype of secondary HLH that carries a relatively poor prognosis. Although commonly associated with T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma-associated cases have also been reported in the literature. Herein, we present 2 cases associated with lymphoma and highlight the fact that underlying lymphoma was difficult to initially diagnose in both cases, complicating therapeutic decisions. "

A histological and immunohistochemical study of four cases," Materials and methods Four cases were collected from a series by one of the authors (M.K.). The medical records of four cases were extensively reviewed. The tissue specimens were fixed in formalin, routinely processed, and embedded in paraffin. For light microscopy, the sections were stained using hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections using a Ventana automated (BenchMark TM ) stainer according to the manufacturer's directions. A panel of antibodies against human immunoglobulin light chain (? and ?) (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), IgD (Novocastra), IgM (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), PS-1 (CD3; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), 4C7 (CD5; Novocastra), 56C6 (CD10; Novocastra), L26 (CD20;Dako), 124 (bcl-2 ; Dako), and anti-follicular dendritic cell (FDC) antibodies (CAN.42; Dako) was used. Replacement of the primary antibodies by normal rabbit- and mouse-serum was used as a negative control. In situ hybridization (ISH) with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER) oligonucleotides was performed to investigate the specimens for the presence of EBV small RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using a Ventana automated (BenchMark TM ) stainer. Paraffin-embedded tissues from the biopsy specimen were prepared for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and rearranged heavy-chain genes were amplified using the seminested PCR method as described by Wan et al. [15]. "

The peak incidence in women is between 35 and 55 years, predominantly between 45 and 49 years, and the malignant cases are more frequently seen in older ages than the benign ones. 2,4  The aggressive cases represent less than 0.5% of all breast malignancies. 5   In general, breast nodules are rare in adolescents and they usually are fibroadenomas. Even if uncommon, sometimes phyllodes tumors can occur even at this age and, considering their malignant potential and the high rate of recurrence, a correct differential diagnosis versus the more frequent benign fibroadenomas is an issue of primary importance and also of particular difficulty. 4   Here we present a very rare case of phyllodes tumor that occurred in an adolescent female patient affected by Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), first detected with 18-fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and describe the role of PET/CT in the diagnosis and in the subsequent clinical management.

In the past 3 months, she noted multiple upper respiratory infections, fatigue, fevers, chills, night sweats, and a 10-pound weight loss. She reported recent blood work by her PCP which was negative for any infection or identifiable illness. Her vital signs were within normal limits. C6-T1 spinous process and right upper trapezius tenderness were present. Cervical range of motion, motor, sensory, and reflex exams were symmetric and within normal limits. Spurling's test reproduced her symptoms and cervical traction improved them. She was started on a course of oral steroids and an MRI of the cervical spine showed no disc pathology, stenosis or spinal lesions, but partially captured a superior mediastinal mass. Chest CT and body PET/CT scans showed enhancing enlarged supraclavicular and right mediastinal lymph nodes.

Most patients experience abnormal bleeding and have a large, bulky cervix on pelvic examination. Because cervical lymphomas typically arise within the cervical stroma rather than the mucosa, cytology is not a sensitive screening tool. Histologically, cervical lymphoma appears similar to lymphomas arising in other sites. It is important to make the correct diagnosis of this uncommon disease because the treatment for cervical lymphomas differs from more common cervical cancers. We report a series of 6 patients and provide a review of the literature on primary lymphoma of the uterine cervix."

We extracted data for DLBCL using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition (ICD-O-3) codes 9680/3 and 9680/4. Results were restricted to the sinonasal tract using ICD-O-3 anatomic site codes C30.0 Nasal cavity, C31.0 maxillary sinus, C31.1 ethmoid sinus, C31.2 frontal sinus, C31.3 sphenoid sinus, C31.8 overlapping lesions of accessory sinuses (indicating multiple sinus involvement), and C31.9 accessory sinus, not otherwise specified. Preset variables, site-specific factors, and collaborate staging codes were used to collect demographics and disease specific parameters from SEER. All data were extracted using SEER*Stat 8.0.4 (Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute, 2012). Relative survival (RS) for each overall cohort was also calculated using SEER*Stat. Disease specific survival (DSS) was calculated via Kaplan–Meier analysis using JMP Statistical Discovery 10 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC); Hazard ratios were derived using RSs and fitting to multivariate Cox proportional hazards models with all available data (including unknowns) using CanSurv 1.1 (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). Data were also extracted regarding patients with the diagnosis of DLBCL of all other head and neck sites for the purpose of comparison to sinonasal disease.

These cases were selected from approximately 30 cases of HL involving the lung, the others having been excluded from this study for one or more of the following reasons: systemic disease at the time of pulmonary involvement, bulky mediastinal lesion directly involving the adjacent lung, lack of adequate histologic tissue material for review and immunohistochemical staining, or inadequate clinical information. In addition, to be included in the series, cases had to have a clinically exclusive or preponderant pulmonary involvement so as to suggest a primary lung tumor. Clinical information was retrieved from hospital medical records and/or referring physicians. Staging modalities have been carried out in all patients, including CT scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and bone marrow biopsies. Routine histologic sections were prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed through the avidin-biotin complex technique using commercially available antibodies raised against broad-spectrum keratins, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CD3, CD4, CD15, CD30, and CD45.

2615,S2253-8089(14)00104-9,Giant cardiac tumour thrombus on staging contrast enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT in a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"Unlike bland, venous thromboembolism (VTE) thrombus, tumour thrombus is a rare complication and is seen in solid cancers including renal cell carcinoma, Wilms’ tumour, testicular tumour, adrenal cortical carcinoma, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. 1,2  In patients with advanced stage NHL, the incidence of VTE is high, but tumour thrombus is very rare. Rare cases of tumour thrombus in NHL have been reported with CECT, 2  but none on PET/CECT. PET/CECT has a very useful role in differentiating tumour thrombus from VTE owing to complementary functional information provided by PET/CECT. A SUV max cut-off of 3.63 has been suggested to differentiate tumour thrombus from benign VTE with reasonable certainty in a mixed population of tumours. 3  Whether the same cut-off is suitable for all types of tumours needs further evaluation. In the patient studied, a giant tumour thrombus was incidentally discovered on PET/CECT and it was characterised as such. Early recognition of this rare complication by PET/CECT is important to change the management plan and prevent unnecessary long-term anti-coagulation therapy. 1  Also, it can be fatal if not managed appropriately in time. The incidence of thrombosis is high in patients suffering from malignancy. 18F-FDG PET/CECT can play a very important role in detecting tumour thrombus in oncology patients. As, PET/CECT is routinely used for evaluation of cancer patients, it can be used for assessment and characterisation of thrombosis in this population."
2622,S0046-8177(13)00190-1,Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma involving a longstanding fibrous meningioma: an initial manifestation of systemic disease," 2 Clinical presentation The patient is a 62-year-old Latin American woman with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She had been clinically diagnosed with a meningioma in the left parietooccipital area via imaging studies 14 years prior. She had been observed with no change in clinical or imaging findings until recently, when she began having worsening headaches, neck pain, nausea, blurred vision, and dizziness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging at this time showed a 3.4 × 2.9 × 1.8 cm extra-axial, lobulated mass in the left parietooccipital region, with tumor extension into the overlying calvarium (Fig. 1 ). The radiographic appearance was again typical for meningioma, but the presence of bone invasion suggested that the tumor might have undergone malignant progression. She then underwent a left parietooccipital image-guided craniotomy and resection. During surgery, the tumor was noted to erode entirely through the dura. The tumor was completely resected with good dural margins. A large piece of bone was also resected due to suspicion of bone invasion. Intraoperative consultation was requested, and the diagnosis of “meningioma” was rendered. Pathologic examination revealed a composite meningioma and low-grade B-cell lymphoma. The lymphoma was noted to involve the calvarial bone marrow spaces, the dura, and the meningioma (see below). After recovering from surgery, the patient was referred to medical oncology for further workup. Physical examination revealed no lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. Complete blood cell count showed mild hypochromic microcytic anemia, but no lymphocytosis. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography revealed an abnormal retroperitoneal soft tissue density, mild prominence of the right axillary lymph nodes, and mild diffuse bone marrow activity, with a low fludeoxyglucose uptake, suggestive of low-grade malignancy. A bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy were subsequently performed and showed extensive involvement by a low-grade B-cell lymphoma (see below). The patient was started on rituximab, cyclophosphamide, oncovin, and prednisone chemotherapy. Adriamycin was withheld due to low ejection fraction. Rituximab was discontinued after the first course because of a rash that the patient did not tolerate. Overall, the patient received 12 courses of cyclophosphamide, oncovin, and prednisone. Follow-up positron emission tomographic scan showed her to be in complete remission, and clinical follow-up remains without any findings, 1 year following remission. "
2627,S0046-8177(05)00081-X,A review of 55 cases of cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia: reassessment of the histopathologic findings leading to reclassification of 4 lesions as cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma and 19 as pseudolymphomatous folliculitis," 2 Patients and methods A retrospective review of cases identified 55 patients who were treated between 1990 and 2001 for cutaneous pseudolymphomas without epidermotropism. Of these 55 cases, 30 had been diagnosed at Saitama Medical School and 25 after further consultation. All the pathological material that was reviewed had been obtained at the initial biopsy or excision. Of these 55 cases, 52 had been diagnosed as lymphadenosis benigna cutis, lymphocytoma cutis, or CLH, and 3 cases had been considered to be due to lymphocytic infiltration of Jessner. Three different patterns of lymphoid cell infiltration were identified based on the histologic appearances: diffuse, patchy, or band-like. In the diffuse pattern, there was lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis or from dermis to the subcutis without any nodule formation (Fig. 1A). In the patchy pattern, islands of lymphocytic infiltration were recognizable on low-power magnification even when there was some confluence of the islands (Fig. 1B). With the band-like pattern, there was horizontal lymphocytic infiltration in the upper dermis (Fig. 1C). In addition, we also assessed the presence or absence of the following features: (1) focal nested-like or sheet-like monotonous proliferating patterns in the so-called centrocyte-like cells; (2) prolific plasma cells at the periphery of the lymphocytic infiltrate; (3) infiltration of the lymphocytes into the sebaceous or sweat glands; (4) lymphoid follicle formation; and (5) morphologic irregularity of the hair follicles (activated pilosebaceous units). Five-micrometer-thick sections of a paraffin-embedded specimen that had been fixed in 10% buffered formalin were prepared for hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining was carried out after antigen retrieval by microwaving in 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0) 2 times for 5 minutes at 900 W. The streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method was used for immunostaining with a Ventana OH system immunostainer (Tucson, Ariz). The primary antibodies that were used against the lymphoid antigens are listed in Table 1 . Human tonsillar tissue was used as the normal control. The main features that were being evaluated during immunohistochemical testing were (1) the ratio between the B and T cells; (2) the prevalence of pan B-cell antigen–positive cells; (3) the ratio between the ? and ? chain–positive cells; (4) the degree of infiltration of CD20-positive cells into the sebaceous or sweat glands; and (5) the proliferation of CD1a- or S-100 protein–positive cells in or around the pilosebaceous units. For the genotype studies, the genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Tissue samples from 13 cases were sectioned, deparaffinized with xylene, and hydrated before being scraped into polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tubes using a single-edge razor blade. The tissues were digested using proteinase K (200 ?g/mL). The supernatant containing the DNA was used for PCR amplification. The PCR process used 3 VH primers and 2 JH primers to detect rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene and the product was analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described by Tange and Kayano [10].

2635,S0090-8258(05)00366-5,Two cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting as primary gynecologic malignancies," Case 1 A 66-year-old white female, post-menopausal for 12 years, presented to her primary care physician complaining of a 1-month history of abdominal bloating, increased abdominal girth, early satiety, and a nodule in the left groin. Physical exam revealed a 16-week sized uterine mass with extension and fixation to the anterior abdominal wall. A 3-cm firm mass was also palpated in the left groin. The patient's review of systems was negative for fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, or bowel or bladder symptoms. The patient had annual Pap smears and mammogram that were negative, as well as a negative colonoscopy 3 years prior to the onset of symptoms. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive soft tissue heterogeneous densities throughout the abdomen and pelvis. A 9.2 × 4.3 cm omental mass was noted in the right upper quadrant, and a 10.9 × 13.8 cm heterogeneous mass contiguous with the uterus and right adnexa extended into the left inguinal region. A CA-125 was elevated at 2361 U/ml. A pre-operative chest X-ray was negative. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of ovarian cancer was suspected. She underwent a supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. Intraoperative findings revealed a large omental cake, and multiple 1-cm nodules studding the small and large bowel, diaphragm, and peritoneum. Bilateral ovarian masses were also noted including a 12-cm right adnexal mass. A 3-cm implant was noted on the colon, but there was no evidence of a gastrointestinal primary. The implants on the bowel, diaphragm, and peritoneum were not resected. Postoperatively, the patient did well except for a mild ileus. The initial pathology was consistent with an undifferentiated malignant neoplasm. Immunophenotyping/flow cytometric analysis revealed a predominant population of monoclonal B-cells expressing the CD 20 marker. A diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma, or NHL, of intermediate grade was made. Using traditional FIGO staging, the patient was a Stage IIIC ovarian cancer; however, she was a Stage IV lymphoma using the lymphoma Ann Arbor Staging system. The patient was referred to Hematology/Oncology and treated with 8 courses of CHOP/rituximab chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). After 4 courses of chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed almost complete resolution of disease with minimal lymphadenopathy. After completion of 8 courses, her CT scan and physical exam were normal. The patient remains without evidence of disease 18 months after diagnosis. "
2639,S1879-7296(13)00041-0,Lymphoma presenting as a peritonsillar abscess," Case report A 66-year-old woman, without history of recurrent tonsillitis or other notable pathology, was admitted for right odynophagia of 10 days’ evolution, with associated fever. Oropharyngeal examination found lockjaw and arching of the right anterior pillar, with deviation and edema of the uvula. The tonsils were hypertrophic, with intracrypt ulceration of the right tonsil. All the oropharyngeal mucosa was congestive. Cervical examination found two 3-cm superior right jugular-carotid adenopathies that were firm, mobile and painless. Given the suspect aspect of the right tonsil, an emergency CT scan was taken and found right tonsil hypertrophy with a 30-mm gathering in the center associated with infiltration of the facing parapharyngeal fat (Fig. 1 ). Puncture of the swelling found plentiful puss, confirming the diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess. Incision-drainage was associated to 10 days’ intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid antibiotherapy. Evolution was good, with resolution of fever, lockjaw and pillar arching. Multiple biopsies within and at the edges of the ulceration were taken to determine its nature, but proved negative. Given the persistence of the tonsillar hypertrophy and a suspicion of tumoral etiology underlying the abscess, bilateral tonsillectomy was performed at 10 days. Histology with immunohistochemistry found non-Hodgkin tonsillar lymphoma (Figs. 2 and 3  ). At the time of writing, the patient was undergoing chemotherapy. "

The Cotswold’s staging classification (Table 1)  used today is a revision of the Ann Arbor system and is based on the meeting organized in the Cotswolds, England, in 1988.3 It was recommended that 1) computed tomography scan be included as a technique for evaluating intrathoracic and infradiaphragmatic lymph nodes; 2) that the criteria for clinical involvement of the spleen and liver be modified to include evidence of focal defects with 2 imaging techniques and that abnormalities of liver function be ignored; 3) that the suffix “X” be used to designate bulky disease (>10-cm maximum dimension); and 4) that a new category of response to therapy, unconfirmed/uncertain complete remission, be introduced to accommodate the difficulty of persistent radiologic abnormalities of uncertain significance. The recommended initial evaluation of a patient with newly diagnosed Hodgkin’s is outlined in Table 2.   "
2646,S0016-5107(03)01979-5,Gamma/Delta T-Cell Lymphoma of Duodenal Bulb A Case Report," Case Report A 74-year-old Japanese woman was referred for evaluation because of epigastric pain, anorexia, and weight loss (5 kg) of 2 months' duration. Examination disclosed pain on palpation of the upper abdomen without guarding, rebound tenderness, and a 1-cm solid mass in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. There was no superficial lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly. Laboratory data at admission included the following: soluble IL-2 receptors, 1300 U/mL (normal: 135–483 U/mL); thyroid-stimulating hormone, 4.8?U/mL (0.25–4.5 ?U/mL); and antithyroglobulin antibodies, 63.1 U/mL (0–0.3 U/mL). The complete blood count, including 3 differential counts, was within normal limits, and a test for antihuman T-cell leukemia virus-1 antibody was negative. Barium contrast radiography demonstrated a 2-cm–long circumferential stricture of the duodenal bulb (Fig. 1A). At endoscopy, the pyloric ring was thickened and the duodenal bulb was narrowed by an eroded mass (Fig. 1B). EUS demonstrated the lesion as a hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass with invasion of the fourth sonographic layer of the duodenal wall, suggesting invasion to the muscularis propria. Periduodenal lymphadenopathy was not detected. Histopathologic assessment of 4 biopsy specimens from the mass revealed a diffuse proliferation of medium to large lymphocytes with markedly atypical and pleomorphic nuclei containing prominent nucleoi (Fig. 2A). A number of tumor cells were strongly immunopositive for antibodies against UCHL-1 (CD45RO) (Fig. 2B) and CD3, but none were positive for L26 (CD20). These histologic findings were compatible with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (WHO classification). Genetic analysis, by using the PCR, showed clonal rearrangement of the both TCR gamma and delta chain genes, and immunostaining disclosed the tumor cells to be positive for TCR gamma, suggesting that the lymphoma cells were derived from gamma/delta T-cells (Fig. 2C). A rapid ureas test was positive, Helicobacter pylori infection was detected in forceps biopsy specimens from gastric mucosa, and anti–H pylori Ig G antibody was detected in serum. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was not detected by in situ hybridization or immunostaining for EBV LMP-1 by using biopsy specimens from the lymphoma.   CT revealed thickening of the wall of the duodenal bulb (Fig. 3) and a low density 1.8-cm nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid but revealed neither hepatosplenomegaly nor any superficial, mediastinal, or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Gallium scintigraphy demonstrated high uptake in both the duodenal bulb and the right lobe of the thyroid, but not in the liver, the spleen, or any lymph node. No GI lesion other than that in the duodenal bulb was found in a series of examinations, including barium contrast radiography, colonoscopy, and ileoscopy. There was no evidence of bone marrow involvement as disclosed by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy specimens from the right and left iliac crest and sternum (aspiration only). Although FNA of the thyroid nodule did not confirm lymphomatous involvement, a diagnosis of stage EIV lymphoma was made based on the CT and gallium scintigraphy findings.  The patient underwent chemotherapy (THP-COP: pirarubicin hydrochloride [THP], cyclophosphamide, vincristin, prednisolone). After 4 courses, CT, gallium scintigraphy, endoscopy (Fig. 4), and histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens revealed no evidence of lymphomal involvement in either the duodenal bulb or the thyroid gland. At 12 months' follow-up, after completion of 8 courses of THP-COP chemotherapy, there was no evidence of recurrence.  "

2654,S0090-8258(04)01020-0,Neoadjuvant combined chemotherapy followed by external whole pelvic irradiation in two cases of primary extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the uterine cervix," Case reports Patient 1 is a 32-year-old white nulligravida who presented in August 1999 with a two and a half month history of bloody vaginal discharge and postcoital vaginal bleeding. Her previous cervical cytology exam was normal. A bulky endophytic 6 cm cervical mass was noted on pelvic examination. The tumor invaded the upper third of the vagina and both parametriums without compromising the pelvic sidewall. Therefore, FIGO stage IIb tumor was diagnosed. Punch biopsy was performed and preliminary histopathology classified the tumor as an undifferentiated small cell carcinoma or a lymphoma. Immunohistochemical study was ordered. Meanwhile, chest, abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed a solid 8 cm lesion on the uterine cervix and no evidence of metastatic disease. Two days later, she presented with massive vaginal bleeding that was controlled by bilateral extraperitoneal hypogastric artery ligation. Immunohistochemical study showed CD20 and antileukocyte common antigen positivity but CD30, CD45Ro and pancytokeratine stainings were negative. Final pathological diagnosis was primary diffuse mixed small and large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma according to the WHO classification. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of lymphoma. Ann-Arbor Stage IEA was diagnosed. She was then treated with 3 cycles of CHOP with complete remission at clinical examination and pelvic CT scan. Chemotherapy was followed by external whole pelvis irradiation with Cobalt 60 (four-field box technique), for a total dose of 4500 cGy. She remains disease free 61 months after the initial diagnosis. Patient 2 is a 31-year-old white gravida 1 para 1 woman who presented in July 2003 with a 2 month history of vaginal bloody discharge. Her previous cervical cytology exam was normal. Colposcopic examination revealed an enlarged cervix. Vaginal ultrasound found a 93 × 70 mm central cervical mass. Punch biopsy was performed and pathological examination confirmed a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Further immunohistochemical study showed CD20 positivity but CD3 staining was negative. Final pathological diagnosis was primary diffuse mixed small and large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the uterine cervix, according to the WHO classification. Computed tomographic scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a soft tissue cervical tumor and right pelvic adenopaties. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for lymphoma. Ann-Arbor stage IIEA was diagnosed. She started neoadjuvant chemotherapy with m-CHOP protocol every 28 days for four cycles. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan showed no evidence of disease. As planned, external whole pelvis radiation was administered with Cobalt 60 (four-field box technique), for a total dose of 3600 cGy. Five weeks after finishing her radiation therapy, estrogenic cervical mucus was noted at the time of pelvic examination. The potential for microscopic residual tumor in the cervix or regional lymph nodes was considered, and radical hysterectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection was offered. Surgery was performed 6 weeks after completion of primary therapy with no incidents. Histopathologic evaluation of cervix, parametriums and lymph nodes confirmed complete response. She remains with no evidence of recurrent disease 15 months after the initial diagnosis. "
2662,S0959-8049(04)00759-2,Medical history and risk for lymphoma: results of a population-based case-control study in Germany," 2 Patients and methods  2.1 Study population The study was carried out from 1999 to 2002 in six regions of Germany as a population-based case-control study among 18–80 year old adults, matched 1:1 for gender, age (+/? year of birth), and study region. Details of the study design have been published elsewhere in Ref. [12]. Briefly, the cases were recruited from hospitals and office-based physicians involved in the diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma in the study regions. They were interviewed by trained interviewers and asked for a 20 ml blood sample. The participation rate was 87.4%. Diagnoses were collected in form of copies of the official pathology reports of the respective pathologies which were verified by reference pathologists for approximately 46% of the cases. In late 2003, for quality assurance of the diagnoses, a 10% random sample of all of the cases included was re-evaluated within a reassessment system in the context of the European collaboration, Epilymph. The German lymphoma study is imbedded in this multicentre study that is coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (Lyon), (for details on Epilymph and further international cooperation see Becker and colleagues report in Ref. [12]). All cases are classified according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification system [17]. Subsequent to the quality assurance step within Epilymph, the codification of all German cases was checked by the German member of the pathology expert panel and this led, when considered with newly received reference pathology reports, to some changes in the number of cases. We included in the analysis 12 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases (7 B-ALL, 2 T-ALL and 3 ALL not otherwise specified), (together with the respective controls) which had previously been left out, and removed 2 cases whose final diagnoses were not confirmed lymphomas. The study therefore comprised 710 case-control pairs (390 males, 320 females) from which 115 cases (16.2%) were Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), 554 (78.0%) B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-NHL) and 35 (4.9%) T-cell NHL. Four cases were diagnosed as having ALL not otherwise specified, one case was diagnosed as having HL and NHL, and one case was a lymphoma not otherwise specified. The number of cases in the main subentities differs slightly from the initial publication [12] and they are therefore presented within Table 3 . The controls were drawn randomly from population registers of the study regions which have an almost 100% coverage due to compulsory registration by law. The controls were individually matched for gender, age and study region. The participation rate was 44.3%. Medical history was obtained from study participants by self-report. With the exception of three conditions (warts, aphtae, and herpes), the questionnaire asked throughout whether the patient was informed by a physician as having been diagnosed of the respective disease. For each positive response, the approximate age of the first physician-diagnosed disease was also collected. Data analysis was carried out for all lymphomas combined, the major subgroups HL, B-NHL and T-NHL, and the more frequent subentities (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia of B-cell type (B-CLL), mucosa-associated lympoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and multiple myeloma). We present the ‘exposures’ under consideration and the respective results for all lymphomas combined, and selective results for some subentities. More detailed analyses are left for subsequent pooled analyses of all centres within Epilymph.   2.2 Statistical analysis All lymphomas combined were analysed using matched conditional logistic regression taking the matching variables gender, age and study region into account. Due to sparse data, subentities were analysed by unconditional logistic regression using the matching variables for adjustment. Relative risks were estimated by OR and associated 95% confidence limits (95% CL) using the SAS® (Statistical Analysis System) procedure PHREG for conditional and LOGISTIC for unconditional logistic regression (SAS version 8, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). If relevant, OR was adjusted in both approaches for smoking in five categories (non-current smokers as the reference category, 1–9 cigarettes/day, 10–19 cigarettes/day, 20–29 cigarettes/day, ?30 cigarettes/day) or educational level in three categories (low: <10 years of schooling and none or regular vocational training, medium: 10–?13 years of schooling and no advanced college or university degree, high: ?13 years of schooling and/or advanced university degree the medium educational level is taken as the reference).

He complained of flu-like symptoms, fever, and night sweats of 1-week duration. On physical examination spleen tip was palpable, but no palpable adenopathy. His CBC revealed the following: WBC 41,000?l, hematocrit 44%, and platelet count 132,000?l. Examination of the peripheral blood film revealed a population of large mononuclear cells (approximately 20% of the nucleated cells), containing a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, prominent cytoplasmic basophilia, and an immature nuclear chromatin pattern. Blood chemistries were notable for the following: LDH 30,471IU/l (normal range 313–618IU/l); uric acid 13.2mg/dl (4.0–8.5mg/dl), phosphorous 4.4mg/dl (2.2–4.1mg/dl), serum creatinine 1.4mg/dl (0.8–1.3mg/dl), BUN 16mg/dl (8–22mg/dl), AST 181IU/l (17–59IU/l), ALT 61IU/l (21–72IU/l), Alkaline phosphatase 97IU/l (38–72IU/l), Albumin 4.5g/dl (3.5–4.6g/dl), and direct bilirubin 0.4mg/dl (0.0–0.3mg/dl). Lumbar puncture revealed no evidence of atypical cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were notable for splenomegaly at 16cm. There was no significant lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed 90% blasts, morphologically consistent with lymphoblasts. Although a few blasts had cytoplasmic vacuoles with FAB-L3 morphology, most were more conistent with FAB-L1/L2 morphology. Peroxidase stain on aspirate smears was negative; PAS staining showed very few PAS positive blasts. Bone marrow biopsy sections showed a markedly hypercellular marrow with almost complete replacement by lymphoblasts. Mitotic figures were increased; staining for the proliferation antigen Ki-67 was positive in 80–90% of the tumor cells. Focal areas showed increased tangible-body macrophages, indicating increased cell turnover and imparting a “starry-sky” appearance (Fig. 1 ). Immunophenotyping of bone marrow blasts by flow cytometry (Fig. 2 ) showed an abnormal B-precursor phenotype as follows: CD19+/CD20+ (subset only)/CD10+/cytoplasmic CD22+/CD9+/CD56+/HLA-DR+. Blasts were negative for both cytoplasmic and surface immunoglobulin lights, myeloid associated markers (CD13, CD33, CD117 and myeloperoxidase), T-cell associated markers [CD1a, CD2, CD3 (both surface and cytoplasmic), CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8], and the stem cell marker CD34. Staining for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was also negative. Biopsy immunostains failed to show definitive surface or cytoplasmic staining for IgG, IgA, or IgM expression. Based on the initial morphology and immunophenotype, a preliminary diagnosis of B-precursor ALL was made. One week later, cytogenetic studies showed 19 of 20 metaphase spreads with the following karyotype: 47 XY, +i(1)(q10),t(8;14)(q24;q32) (Fig. 3 ). Given the clinical acuity and aggressiveness of this disease process, therapy was initiated with hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, mesna vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) alternating with high dose methotrexate/ARA-C. This regimen have been used in both pre-B ALL and Burkitt’s leukemia [6,18]. "

Haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections were reviewed and classified according to the WHO International Histological Classification of Hematopoietic Tumors of Domestic Animals (Valli et al., 2002).   2.2 Immunohistochemistry Serial sections were placed on silanized slides and dewaxed. Antigen retrieval was performed after hydration and endogenous peroxidase blocking with 3% H2O2 in a steamer at 90 °C for 30 min. The slides were then incubated overnight (18 h) at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD79a (clone HM57; Dakopatts, Carpenteria, CA, USA), diluted 1 in 50; anti-CD3 (code A0452, rabbit polyclonal; Dakopatts), diluted 1 in 50; anti-myeloperoxidase (rabbit polyclonal; Dakopatts), diluted 1 in 400; anti-lysozyme (rabbit polyclonal; Dakopatts), diluted 1 in 500; and anti-p53 (CM1, rabbit polyclonal; Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle, UK), diluted 1 in 100. For anti-CD79a, specific binding was detected with the CSA (Catalized Signal Amplification) peroxidase system (K1500; Dakopatts). For all other markers, the EnVision peroxidase system (K1491; Dakopatts) was used. Labelling was “visualized” with 3,3?-diaminobenzidine (D-5637; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) added to H2O2 3% in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.6). Positive controls consisted of canine reactive lymph nodes with known immunohistochemical properties. In negative controls the primary antibody was replaced by bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1% in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6. Immunolabelling was evaluated microscopically. A tumour was considered to have a B immunophenotype when at least 10% of the neoplastic cells reacted exclusively with anti-CD79a, and a T immunophenotype when at least 10% exclusively expressed CD3. Immunolabelling of neoplastic cells for p53 was scored as follows: 0, none positive; 1, <10% positive (nuclear labelling); 2, >10% positive.   2.3 Statistical Analysis The tests used were the exact Fisher test, Chi-square test or the Mann–Whitney test (Statistical Analysis System: SAS for Windows), P<0.05 being considered significant.

2701,S0385-8146(03)00153-6,Two cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the accessory parotid gland," 2 Case reports  2.1 Case 1 A 78-year-old man, with a 7-month history of an asymptomatic swelling in his left cheek, was referred by his family doctor. Physical examination revealed a 45 mm×40 mm hard and nonmobile mass (Fig. 1 ), without any enlargement in the cervical lymph nodes and Waldeyer’s ring. Chest X-ray, hematologic studies and urinalysis were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scanning clearly defined the lesion as a separating mass from the main parotid gland (Fig. 2 ). Gallium scintigraphy showed abnormal uptake in the area coincident with the cheek mass. The sialogram revealed a narrowing of the main parotid duct at the tumor site and a dilatation in the peripheral portion. Fine needle aspiration was not performed. An accessory parotid gland tumor was suspected, and it was thought most likely to be a pleomorphic adenoma. Differential diagnosis included both benign and malignant neoplasms. Under general anaesthesia a standard preauricular–submandibular incision with an anterior extension was made, and then dissection was carried forward in order to expose the anterior margin of the parotid gland, and the zygomatic and buccal branches of the facial nerve. The tumor, existing over the masseter muscle without any connection with the parotid gland, was extirpated. A single accessory duct running from the tumor to Stensen’s duct was ligated and resected with the tumor(Fig. 3 ). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for leucocyte common antigen (LCA) and pan-B cell markers (MB-1 and L26), but were negative for pan-T cell markers (UCHL-1 and MT-1). Histopathological diagnosis of the resected was non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, follicular small cleaved cell type of B-cell linage according to the classification of Working Formulation (Fig. 4A ) [10]. Although the mass was largely made up of the lymphoma cells, salivary tissue was preserved in part (Fig. 4B). Therefore the lesion was decided to be the lymphoma arising from the accessory parotid gland. A staging workup with whole body CT and abdominal ultrasonography revealed no other foci of tumor. The patient received four courses of chemotherapy with THP-cop regimen (vincristine, pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide and prednisolone). After a satisfactory initial response, the tumor recurred and continued to progress despite radiotherapy. The patient died from disseminated disease 36 months after presentation. An autopsy request was refused by the patient’s family.   2.2 Case 2 A 70-year-old man was referred because of an enlargement of painless mass at the left cheek. It had been previously noticed for about 1 year. Physical examinations revealed a 38 mm×32 mm elastic hard and nonmobile mass at the left cheek without any other abnormalities. Sialo-CT scanning with contrast medium demonstrated the lesion as a separating mass from the main parotid gland with enhancement spot (Fig. 5 ). The Gallium scintigraphy showed abnormal uptake in the area coincident with the cheek mass. Fine needle aspiration was not performed. The tumor was thought most likely to be a malignant lymphoma in the accessory parotid gland. Under general anesthesia the lesion was exposed using a combination of preauricular and submandibular incision with an anterior extension. Both the zygomatic and the buccal branches of the facial nerve were observed in close proximity to the mass. A single accessory duct from the mass entered Stensen’s duct, although the mass partially adhered to a part of the Stensen’s duct. Histopathological examination revealed a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, diffuse medium-sized cell type of B-cell lineage according to the classification of Working Formulation [10]. The tumor cells were positive for leucocyte common antigen and pan-B cell markers (L26), but were negative for pan-T cell markers (UCHL-1) in immunohistochemical examinations. It is possible to demonstrate that the neoplastic lymphoid cells and salivary ducts are intermingled. (Fig. 6 ). Postoperatively, the patient was treated with three courses of combined chemotherapy (THP-cop) and external irradiation of 50Gy to the left cheek region. Currently, 69 months after the initial diagnosis, he is free of local and systemic disease.  "
2703,S0190-9622(11)01804-4,Case report: Cutaneous lymphoma of difficult diagnose,"Methods: PRD, 53 years, married, male, brown, born in Petrópolis-RJ, referring, for a year, generalized rash throughout the body, associated with mild erythematous peeling, searched medical help and was conducted to biopsy in three sites with histopathologic diagnosis of mycosis fungoides (10/12/2010), which did not close the immunohistochemical diagnosis. The patient was referred to the INCA (National Cancer Institute), which concluded the diagnosis as superficial perivascular dermatitis (01/03/2011). In April 2011, he searched the dermatology department where the biopsies were repeated and requested Sézary cells study. Histopathologic findings (29/04/2011) of the three sites were consistent with Parapsoriasis and the study for Sézary cells was little suggestive, since no Sézary cells were visualized. Faced with the of difficult management framework, we chose to start treatment for mycosis fungoides with NB-UVB and repeat biopsy in 6 months."
2712,S0022-510X(14)00406-7,Primary leptomeningeal CNS lymphoma presenting as bilateral facial nerve palsy," 2 Case report We report on a 66year-old man who presented to our emergency room with acute weakness of the left facial muscles. His past medical history was remarkable only for bilateral deafness due to perinatal meningitis. Neurologic examination disclosed complete left facial nerve palsy. Diagnosis of facial palsy ‘a frigore’ was made, and the patient was treated with oral corticosteroids, with incomplete recovery. One week later, he manifested contralateral facial palsy. He was admitted to our ward. Neurologic examination disclosed peripheral BFNP, and was otherwise unremarkable. Brain MRI (1.5T) with gadolinium was normal, without any lesion possibly underlying the BFNP. CSF analysis was normal, except for 200lymphocytes/?L (normal range: 0–4cells/?L). Routine blood chemistry tests, which included angiotensin-converting enzyme and autoantibody screening, revealed only a slight anemia (hemoglobin, 10.8g/dL). Serologic and/or viral PCR tests on serum and CSF (HIV, HSV-1/2, VZV, CMV, EBV), whole-body CT-scan, flow cytometry on peripheral blood, and a bone marrow biopsy were normal. Two subsequent lumbar punctures showed an increase in the CSF lymphocytes (400, and 800/?L, respectively). Flow cytometry analysis of the two CSF samples demonstrated the presence of clonal B lymphocytes (CD19+, CD20+, CD22+, CD10+, CD38+, with monotypic lambda light chain restriction), which suggested the presence of a B cell CNS lymphoma. In the search for possible sites of CNS lymphomatous infiltration, a spinal cord and lumbosacral MRI with gadolinium was performed, revealing enhancement in caudal roots (Fig. 1 ). Both the CSF and MRI findings led to the diagnosis of PCNSL, with isolated leptomeningeal involvement. FISH analysis on the CSF lymphocytes showed chromosomal rearrangements of BCL2/18q21 in 100%, and of MYC/8q24 in 77% of the analyzed cells. Such findings fulfilled the criteria for the so-called ‘double-hit’ DLBCL [6]. The patient was treated with two courses of high-dose intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine. After an initial response to the therapy, which matched the disappearance of the chromosomal rearrangements in the CSF cells, the disease progressed, and the patient died three months later. Isolated clinical symptoms of BFNP persisted for the whole disease course, but in the final stages the patient developed reduction in the ankle jerk reflexes. Follow-up brain and spinal cord MRI showed no parenchymal lesions. "
2715,S2152-2650(14)00131-1,Extracavitary Primary Effusion Lymphoma Initially Presenting With Hemophagocytic Lymphohistocytosis," Introduction Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment. It is associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and is most commonly seen in patients with underlying HIV and low CD4 counts. In this report, we describe, to our knowledge, the first case of a 33-year-old man with HIV who presented with high grade fevers, multilineage cytopenias, and colonic mass, and was diagnosed initially with hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH) and was subsequently discovered to have extracavitary PEL. Despite the poor historical outcomes for both conditions, with immunosuppression and R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cytoxan, adriamycin) chemotherapy, the patient achieved a complete remission for both diseases and remains well at 6 months after therapy. Primary effusion lymphoma is an HHV8-associated aggressive B-cell lymphoma that typically involves the body cavities (pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal cavities) as an effusion. It is a rare form of NHL that constitutes approximately 4% of all HIV-associated NHL. Although it usually presents as an effusion, multiple cases of solitary or extracavitary variants of PEL have been described in the literature. PEL is most often seen in HIV-positive patients with low CD4 counts who often have concomitant Kaposi sarcoma or multicentric Castleman disease (MCD); both are HHV8-related diseases. Historically PEL has been treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy with generally poor outcomes. 1,2   Hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis is a poorly understood systemic inflammatory syndrome described by prolonged high grade fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, tissue biopsy demonstrating hemophagocytosis, and other characteristic laboratory and clinical features (Table 1 ). HLH is divided into a primary (genetic) syndrome and a secondary (acquired) syndrome often seen due to underlying concurrent viral infections (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], HIV, HHV8) or hematological malignancies. Despite initiation of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, patients with acquired HLH have a high mortality rate. In patients with HLH secondary to hematologic malignancy, treatments targeting the specific leukemia or lymphoma are favored over primary therapy for the syndrome itself. 3   In our report we describe, to our knowledge, the first patient who presented with concurrent virally mediated extracavitary PEL and HLH.

2723,S0272-6386(13)00491-5,Light Chain Proximal Tubulopathy Without Crystals in a Case of Burkitt Lymphoma Presenting With Acute Kidney Injury," Case Report  Clinical History and Initial Laboratory Data A 26-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of continuous nonradiating pains involving multiple large joints, requiring frequent intravenous analgesics. The joint pains worsened with movement, but were not associated with early morning stiffness, redness, or swelling. There was no history of fever, skin rash, or other symptoms to suggest a connective tissue disorder. Examination showed a well-built man in severe pain with tenderness over the upper and lower limbs and left side of the chest. There was no pallor, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. Initial blood work showed leukocyte count of 19 ×103/?L (comprising 62% polymorphs, 30% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, and 2% eosinophils), hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 288 ×103/?L. Peripheral smear showed few scattered atypical lymphoid cells. Serum creatinine level was 6.1 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 11.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated using the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] Study equation), while urine examination showed albuminuria (1+) quantitated at albumin excretion of 150 mg/24 h, no glucose, 15-20 red blood cells per high-power field, and 1-3 white blood cells per high-power field. There was no bicarbonaturia, phosphaturia, or hyperuricosuria to suggest Fanconi syndrome. Kidney biopsy was performed to ascertain the cause of kidney injury.   Kidney Biopsy Kidney biopsy showed a total of 17 normal glomeruli on light microscopy (Fig 1A). Proximal tubules showed marked cytoplasmic vacuolization with formation of apical blebs, associated with mild interstitial edema (Fig 1B). Distal tubules and blood vessels were normal. Immunofluorescence microscopy evaluation using fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled antibodies revealed cytoplasmic staining for ? light chains within the proximal tubules (Fig 1E), while ? light chains were undetectable (Fig 1F). Tubules showed no staining for all immunoglobulin and complement components. A total of 13 glomeruli gave negative staining results for immunoglobulins, complement, and both light chains. Transmission electron microscopy showed marked lysosomal prominence within the proximal tubules without crystal formation. The phagolysosomal structures were present to the exclusion of other cytoplasmic organelles and contained osmophilic debris and small myelin figures (Fig 1D). Some proximal tubules also showed loss of brush border with apical blebbing.   Diagnosis In view of the light chain proximal tubulopathy identified on kidney biopsy, a series of tests were performed, including a radiologic survey that showed a lytic lesion involving the shaft of the right humerus. Serum protein electrophoresis followed by a free light chain assay showed marked excess of circulating free ? light chains (762 mg/dL), with free ?:? ratio of 0.027. Bone marrow biopsy revealed atypical lymphoid cells showing L3 (FAB [French-American-British] classification) morphology with marked cytoplasmic vacuolization. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate identified the atypical cells as positive for CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79b, CD10, HLA-DR, surface immunoglobulin M, and ? light chains along with aberrant myeloid markers (CD13 and CD33). These cells were negative for ? light chains, antimyeloperoxidase, T-cell markers (cytoplasmic CD3, CD4, and CD7), natural killer cell markers, plasma cell markers (CD38), and immaturity markers such as CD34 and CD117. Morphology and immunophenotype were consistent with Burkitt lymphoma in leukemic phase (Fig 2).    Clinical Follow-up Extracorporeal dialysis was initiated for acute kidney injury. Subsequently, the patient developed shortness of breath and a chest radiograph showed consolidation in the bilateral lower lobes. He was started on intravenous levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam. However, he died of the illness before any definitive chemotherapy could be initiated.  "
2733,S0190-9622(02)91284-3,Localized cutaneous small to medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma: A report of 3 cases stable for years," Case reports Three white patients were diagnosed during a 4-year period (Table I). Two patients were female, and one was male; the median age was 47 years. In patient 1 (Fig 1), a 57-year-old man, indolent papules and plaques had been present for 6 years on both soles.   Fig. 1  Patient 1. Lesions present since 6 years of age on right (A) and left (B) soles. Small to medium-sized pleomorphic lymphoid cells with scattered mitotic figures in upper dermis (C). (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification ×300.)    The lesions did not respond to any local therapy including topical corticosteroids. In patient 2 (Fig 2), a 47-year-old woman, an eczematoid plaque 8 × 4 cm in diameter had been present on the back side of the left upper arm for 7 years causing mild local itching.   Fig. 2  Patient 2. A, Lesion on upper arm present since 7 years of age. B, Small to medium-sized pleomorphic cells in upper dermis. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification ×180.)    In patient 3 (Fig 3), a 26-year-old woman, a nevus-like lesion composed, in part, of confluent papules had invariably been present since the age of 10 years.   Fig. 3  Patient 3. A, Lesion on right shoulder present since 16 years of age. B, Response to topical PUVA bath therapy. C, Small to medium-sized pleomorphic tumor cells in upper dermis. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification ×80.)    Her general practitioner could confirm this medical history. He suggested that this lesion was an inflammatory epidermal nevus, and no therapy had been done during all these years. This patient complained of occasional itching. All clinical data are summarized in Table I. In patient 3 an enlarged lymph node (1.0 × 0.8 cm in diameter) with a reactive pattern was detected by color-coded duplex sonography in the right axilla. The patient refused an excision, and no change in the size or pattern of this lymph node occurred in a follow-up of 42 months. Further clinical staging at the time of diagnosis included for each patient a complete blood cell count with differential, platelet count, Sézary cell count, serum electrolytes, serum chemistry studies with a serum multianalyzer, electrophoresis, complete urinalysis including determination of Bence-Jones proteinuria, chest x-ray film, abdominal sonogram, and computed tomographic scans of chest and abdomen. No lymphoma-associated findings could be obtained with these staging investigations. Histologic examinations of at least 2 biopsy specimens in each case revealed similar results in all patients (Figs 1-3). Mild to moderate acanthosis of the epidermis with no (patients 2 and 3) or very mild (patient 1) atypical exocytosis of single lymphoid cells could be seen. Typical Pautrier's microabscesses were not present. The dermal infiltrate was almost exclusively composed of small to medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells with enlarged hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei. Scattered mitoses could be seen. The infiltrates were top heavy but were found around vessels in the deep dermis in all patients and extended to the subcutaneous fat in patients 1 and 3. Immunohistologic investigations showed that in all cases more than 90% of the infiltrate consisted of CD3+, CD4+, ?/? T-cell receptor-positive tumor cells, which were negative for CD30 (BER-H2), ?/? T-cell receptor, CD7, and CD8. The proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen stained the nuclei of 20% to 40% of the tumor cells. By means of T-cell receptor ?-chain consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), clonality could be demonstrated in all 3 cases. Treatment in patient 1 was performed with etretinate at 50 mg/d and interferon alfa-2a at 9 × 106 IE 3 times a week according to a randomized multicenter protocol of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Dermatologische Onkologie 5  for 1 year. Only limited improvement could be seen, and the therapy was discontinued. Since then, the patient has refused any further therapy. The findings on the skin locally deteriorated again, but have remained stable for 61 months without further therapy until now. In patient 2 the lesion could be excised, and the patient has been in complete remission since then. In patient 3 modified local psoralen ultraviolet A range (PUVA) bath therapy (0.0006 mg/mL of 8-methoxypsoralen solution applied topically 20 minutes before increasing doses of topical UVA radiations) resulted in a complete remission with persistence of noninfiltrated hyperpigmentations (Fig 3, B ). Local relapses occurred at exactly the original sites and were again responsive to local photochemotherapies. No spread of lesions to primary uninvolved skin or to local lymph nodes and no evidence for systemic disease could be observed in any case during a median follow-up of 56 months. "
2741,S0046-8177(03)00607-5,Analysis of 1983 cases of malignant lymphoma in Thailand according to the world health organization classification," Materials and methods This retrospective analysis was approved by the Ethical Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University (No. 43/2001). Consecutive cases of malignant lymphoma diagnosed during the 9-year period from August 1, 1993 to July 31, 2002 based on pathological samples received at Department of Pathology, Siriraj Hospital, in the form of in-house cases or consultation cases, were reviewed and analyzed. The diagnosis of each entity of malignant lymphoma followed the WHO classification monograph1 and was reached by using morphological, immunophenotypical, and relevant clinical features. Cases with diagnoses of all types of leukemia and plasma cell myeloma/plasmacytoma were excluded from the study. The immunophenotype in each case was determined by paraffin section immunoperoxidase as described previously.14 The lymphoid phenotype in cases of NHL was confirmed by CD45. The B-cell phenotype was confirmed by CD20, CD79a, or immunoglobulins with the absence of T-cell markers, and the T-cell phenotype was confirmed by CD3, CD45RO, or CD43 with the absence of B-cell markers. Reed-Sternberg cells in cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) were confirmed by CD15, CD30, or both with the absence of CD45, B-cell, and T-cell markers. The null cell phenotype was identified by the absence of both B-cell and T-cell markers. The lymphoblastic phenotype was confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Based on the limited panel of antibodies for immunophenotyping, the diagnosis of blastic natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type (NK/T) could not be reached. All cases of T-cell lymphoma with angiocentricity and angiodestructive growth pattern and/or fibrinoid necrosis of the blood vessels accompanied by coagulative necrosis, consistent with angiocentric lymphoma in the REAL classification scheme, 2 were diagnosed as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified type, according to the WHO classification system. 1  Clinical information available on the request form at the time of submission of each case was collected. In many cases, clinical information was gathered from all submissions of pathological samples. Information on the subjects’ age, sex, geographical location, and clinical manifestations differentiating nodal and extranodal involvement by lymphoma was used in the analysis. The geographical locations in Thailand included Metropolitan Bangkok and 6 other regions: Central (21 provinces, excluding Bangkok), Northern (9 provinces), Northeastern (19 provinces), Eastern (7 provinces), Western (5 provinces), and Southern (14 provinces) (Fig 1).  According to year 1999 data from Office of Central Register, Ministry of Interior, the total population of Thailand was 61,661,934, distributed as follows: Bangkok, 9.2%; Central, 21.5%, Northern, 10.2%; Northeastern, 34.7%; Eastern, 6.3%; Western, 4.9%; and Southern, 13.2%. For statistical analysis, the ?2 test was used to assess any differences between groups of malignant lymphoma under various conditions. "

2780,S0344-0338(13)00062-9,Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma presenting with fulminant pseudomembranous colitis," Case description A 78-year-old male presented to hospital with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Other medical history is non-contributory. He was started on antibiotics and steroids for COPD exacerbation and admitted to hospital. Soon after, he developed diarrhea and stool enzyme immunoassay was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin. Vancomycin and metronidazole were started with initial improvement, followed by subsequent deterioration with increasing fever, abdominal pain, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia and worsening respiratory status. His peripheral blood counts demonstrated leukocytosis up to 34.3 (normal 4.0–10.5), but predominantly neutrophilic (31.5). No circulating blasts were reported. Hemoglobin and platelet counts were within normal range. Other labs revealed an elevated LDH at 389U/L (normal 100–195) and a low albumin of 11g/L (normal 35–50). Abdominal CT scans revealed pancolitis consistent with pseudomembranous colitis. Lymphadenopathy was not noted in radiology of the chest or abdomen. He underwent urgent subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy. However, on post-op day 1, he developed hypotension refractory to maximum pressor therapy and expired. Post-mortem examination was not performed. On macroscopic pathological examination, the subtotal colectomy specimen was covered by yellow-white purulent pseudomembranes over 90% of its surface (Fig. 1 ). No discrete lesions or grossly abnormal lymph nodes were identified. Histologically, pseudomembranous colitis was noted as expected (Fig. 1). However, there were also several foci of large atypical cells located in submucosal colonic and terminal ileal vascular lumina, as well as scattered cells in the sinusoids of lymph nodes (Fig. 2 ). Atypical lymphocytes were large with single to multiple prominent nucleoli, minimal eosinophilic cytoplasm with frequent mitotic figures. On immunohistochemistry, these atypical cells were positive for CD45, CD79a, PAX5, and MUM1, and negative for pankeratin, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD20, CD34, CD138, TdT, cyclin D1, bcl-2, bcl-6, human herpesvirus-8 and EBER (in situ hybridization). Ki67 proliferative index showed a positivity rate of over 95% (Fig. 3 ). The lymph nodes themselves had preserved architecture with atypical cells confined to sinusoidal spaces only. These histological and immunohistochemical features are consistent with an intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. "
2781,S0002-9343(13)00921-2,Primary Pulmonary Lymphoma: A Case of ‘Unresolving Pneumonia’," Case Presentation A 36-year-old Hispanic nonsmoking man was referred to our institution by his primary care physician with complaints of persistent cough and chest radiograph showing right mid-zone infiltrate. He had been initially treated as an outpatient with antibiotics and was hence referred secondary to persistent symptoms. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of the right hilar infiltrate and revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules bilaterally (Figure 1 ). Review of systems was significant for weight loss of 10 pounds in the preceding 3 months. Physical examination was significant for the presence of inspiratory crackles in the right lower chest. Laboratory data did not reveal any significant abnormalities. CT-guided biopsy revealed a clonal lymphoid neoplasm (Figure 2 , 40× magnification) invading bronchiolar epithelium, with immunohistochemical evidence suggestive of a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type lymphoma. Staging scan with positron emission tomography revealed increased uptake in the right lung mass and other pulmonary nodules, but no evidence of disease elsewhere. Bone marrow biopsy was negative, and a diagnosis of stage IV-B primary pulmonary lymphoma was made. The patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy with R-CHOP (Rituxan [Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif], cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin [Pharmacia Inc., Kalamazoo, Mich], and prednisone) and localized radiotherapy. Two years into follow-up, he has improved remarkably with no residual sequelae. "
2790,S2152-2650(14)00048-2,Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma Presenting As a Paraneoplastic Syndrome With Acute Central Nervous System Demyelination," Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is a mature B-cell neoplasm characterized by accumulation of functionally incompetent clonal lymphocytes with the same morphologic and immunophenotypic features. CLL and SLL have the same cellular basis but SLL lacks significant peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytosis. CLL is the most common leukemia in the United States, accounting for 30% of all leukemias, and SLL accounts for less than 5% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The median age at diagnosis is 65 years, and there is a Caucasian male predominance. 1,2   The World Health Organization classifies SLL and CLL as the same malignancy with differing clinical presentations. 3,4  SLL typically presents with long-standing painless generalized lymphadenopathy; hepatosplenomegaly, extranodal infiltrates, and B symptoms are less commonly present. 5  In CLL, the clinical presentation is highly variable, with 25% of patients presenting with asymptomatic, isolated lymphocytosis. Others present with waxing and waning lymphadenopathy, with or without hepatosplenomegaly, and 5% to 10% have “B” symptoms including night sweats, fevers, fatigue, and weight loss. 4  Less commonly, symptoms related to acquired immunodeficiency or autoimmunity are present. Fewer than 10% of CLL/SLL patients present with nodal involvement alone. The diagnosis of CLL/SLL is made with excisional lymph node biopsy, immunophenotyping of PB using flow cytometry, and/or analysis of bone marrow biopsy. Typical morphologic and immunophenotypic features include a clonal population of small, mature lymphocytes expressing CD19, CD20, CD23, and CD5 with low levels of monotypic surface immunoglobulin (Ig). 4  CLL is defined as PB lymphocytosis of ? 5 × 109/L with the aforementioned phenotype. The term SLL is used in cases of lymphadenopathy with the same tissue morphology and immunophenotype as CLL, but < 5 × 109/L PB monoclonal lymphocytes and no cytopenias because of bone marrow infiltration by the disease. 5   Paraneoplastic and autoimmune complications occur in up to 25% of all patients with CLL/SLL, and most commonly include autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia. 6  Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS) are exceedingly rare in CLL/SLL, however, direct leukemic infiltration of the leptomeninges and brain parenchyma have been described. 7  A paraneoplastic autoimmunity has been suggested to play a role in certain CLL-associated neuromuscular diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome variants and myasthenia gravis, because leukemic cells were absent from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in these cases. 8,9  However, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of CLL/SLL presenting as a paraneoplastic demyelination of the CNS in the absence of CSF infiltration by leukemic cells.

2793,S0936-6555(04)00445-5,Primary central nervous system lymphoma: a single-centre experience of 55 unselected cases," Methods We examined the records of all patients diagnosed with PCNSL at Addenbrooke's Hospital between 1995 and 2003. Only patients with a histological diagnosis of PCNSL were included in the study. Known HIV-positive patients were excluded. Details of tumour site, histological type, staging computed tomography (CT), bone marrow and lumbar puncture were recorded. Slit lamp examination was not carried out routinely. The date of diagnosis was taken as the date of biopsy. Throughout the study period, the intention was that all patients should receive treatment with a chemotherapy regimen involving HDMTX with or without radiotherapy. A number of patients were considered unfit to tolerate HDMTX on the basis of poor performance status, severe cardiorespiratory compromise, advanced renal failure or concurrent uncontrolled sepsis. These patients received either steroid or alternative chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Patients treated with HDMTX received one of three regimens ( Table 1). Early in the study period, patients received MBVP (teniposide, carmustine, methylprednisolone) [26] or CHOD/BVAM (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone/carmustine, vincristine, methotrexate, cytarabine) [27]. However, owing to excessive toxicity, later patients received a less myelotoxic regimen containing HDMTX, procarbazine and cytarabine. This was based on a regimen proposed by Abrey et al. [11]. Before 2002, the intention was to follow HDMTX with whole-brain radiotherapy. From 2002, radiotherapy was withheld from patients who had achieved complete remission because of concerns over delayed neurotoxicity. Response to treatment was recorded as complete remission, defined radiologically by CT or MRI, partial remission defined radiologically by CT or MRI, or progressive disease defined radiologically or clinically. The date of any relapse was recorded along with details of further treatment and, where applicable, the date and cause of death. Results were analysed using Stata Statistics Software [28]. Survival times were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and survival curves compared using the Log-rank test. In patients surviving beyond 12 months, an assessment of functional ability was made. Patients alive at the time of writing were assessed in clinic. For deceased patients, this assessment was based upon a review of case notes or a discussion with the general practitioner. "
2797,S0959-8049(03)00890-6,Little or no space–time clustering found amongst cases of childhood lymphoma in North West England," 2 Patients and methods All cases of children aged 0–14 years, diagnosed with lymphoma between 1 January 1954 and 31 December 2001, and registered by the MCTR were analysed. Reporting practice to the registry has been consistently good during this period. The registry retains histopathological material and diagnostic re-review is undertaken periodically. Ordnance Survey (OS) eight-digit grid references were allocated to each case with respect to addresses at time of birth and diagnosis, locating each address to within 0.1 km. The following diagnostic groups were specified a priori for analysis: (i) Hodgkin's disease (HD); (ii) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); (iii) Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; (iv) all lymphomas. There are six possible space–time interactions between: (i) times and places of diagnosis; (ii) times and places of birth; (iii) time of diagnosis and place of birth; (iv) time of birth and place of diagnosis; (v) time of first symptom and place of birth; and (vi) time of first symptom and place of diagnosis. The interpretation of these interactions will depend on the extent of migration between birth and diagnosis among cases [14]. If the cases have not migrated then these reduce to two possibilities: an interaction between proximity of ‘place of residence’ and time of diagnosis or time of first symptom or time of birth. However, since a large proportion of the children moved between birth and time of first symptom or diagnosis, we believe that migration may have some effect, and there may be differences in the space–time clustering effects that are dependent on spatial definitions. For example, an interaction between times and places of birth only would indicate an aetiological exposure around the place of birth, prenatally or shortly after the time of birth. It would also indicate that the disease has a variable latent period. Furthermore, an interaction between times and places of diagnosis would indicate a later effect which may be explained by an aetiological exposure around the place of diagnosis and close to the time of diagnosis. It would also indicate that the disease has a short latent period following the exposure. Additional details are given in Birch and colleagues in Ref. [14]. Knox [15] tests were applied to the data with thresholds fixed, a priori, as: close in space, less than 5 km, and close in time, less than 1 year apart. One-sided tests were used to detect a significant interaction. The strength of interactions (S) was indicated by calculating [(O?E)/E]×100 counts of pairs which are close in space and close in time (O, observed number of close pairs, and E, expected number of close pairs). To adjust for the effects of different population densities, the tests were repeated replacing geographical distance thresholds by distance to the Nth nearest neighbour, using all locations of all the cases in the data-set except addresses for the same child at a different time. N was chosen such that the mean distance was 5 km (N=11 for both birth and diagnosis locations). Two problems are apparent with the Knox test: boundary problems and the arbitrariness of the thresholds chosen, and these are discussed elsewhere in Ref. [16]. To overcome these, a second order procedure based on K-functions [17] is used, employing both geographical distance and nearest neighbour (NN) approaches as described above. Data were analysed in two age-groups (0–9 years and 10–14 years) and for cross-clustering between the ‘younger’ and ‘older’ cases. This division corresponds to the age distribution of the subtypes of HD. The mixed cellularity subtype predominates in the younger group, whilst the nodular sclerosing subtype predominates in the older group. Data were also analysed by examining clustering pairs which contained at least 1 male case (‘male: any’) and clustering pairs which contained at least 1 female case (‘female: any’). The 50% of addresses that were closer to their 11th NN than the median distance were classified as being located in a more densely populated area, whilst the 50% of addresses that were further from their 11th NN than the median distance were classified as being located in a less densely populated area [16]. Analysis by population density was undertaken by considering clustering pairs which contained at least 1 case from a more densely populated area (‘more densely populated: any’) and clustering pairs which contained at least 1 case from a less densely populated area (‘less densely populated: any’). The methods are given in more detail in Birch and colleagues in Ref. [14] and McNally and colleagues in Ref. [16]. Statistical significance was indicated if P<0.05 for the cases in the specified diagnostic group, using at least 2 of the 4 methods (the geographical or NN versions of the Knox test, or the geographical or NN versions of the K-function method) and including a NN threshold version.

2802,S0748-7983(04)00291-4,Surgical removal of primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) presenting as space occupying lesions: a series of 33 cases," Patients and methods From June 1986 to June 2000, 32 patients for a total of 33 PCNSL were treated. Sixteen were women and 16 men with an average age of 60.7 years, ranging from 28 to 85 years (one female patient was treated twice). All patients were HIV negative. The average follow-up time was 34 months (1–180 months). Depending on rapid neurological deterioration at time of presentation, mass effect signs and tumour location, the patients were treated with either gross total (15) or partial (10) removal of the tumour. In eight cases stereotactic biopsy was performed. The diagnosis of PCNSL was established by chest-X-rays, bone marrow biopsy, abdominal ultrasound and CT scans. All patients were shortly treated with steroids after admission. Six patients had already received additional steroids prior to admission for at least 3 days. All diagnoses were based on routine immunohistochemistry for identification of PCNSL (Fig. 2 A). Neoplasms were considered to be of the B-cell phenotype if the constituent cells were positive for CD20 and/or exhibited membranous ? or ? Ig light chain restriction. A lymphoma was considered to be of T-cell type if the cytological abnormal cell were reactive for CD3, CD5, CD43 and/or CD45RO and lacked immunoreactivity for CD20, CD22 or ? and ? Ig light chains.

She recalled that she had unintentionally lost approximately 20 pounds over the prior four months during which she felt “down”. There was no past history suggestive of immunodeficiency or immune dysregulatory disorder. She was diagnosed with a possible “influenza”, and was empirically treated with antibiotics, antiviral agents and pain medication. She was subsequently hospitalized at a community hospital for further evaluation due to persistent symptoms. In the hospital, her initial laboratory tests revealed an elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 496 units/L (reference range, 15–41) and 552 units/L (reference range, 14–54) respectively, and an increased total serum bilirubin at 2.4mg/dL (reference range, 0.4–1.5). A viral infection was once again considered and the treatment approach remained. While her serum ?-1 antitrypsin level was slightly elevated, all other serology tests were negative including hepatitis A, B, and C, toxoplasmosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, anti-mitochondrial antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen demonstrated numerous low density lesions within the enlarged liver and spleen and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. During the course of her hospitalization, the patient developed cardiac arrhythmia, progressive hepatic failure, renal failure, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. Her serum total bilirubin increased to 5.7mg/dL, and prothrombin time international normalized ratio (INR) was elevated from 1.6 to 3.5. She also developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding and vomited approximately 2L of blood. The patient was managed with fluid replacement, intravenous vitamin K and norepinephrine bitartrate infusion. Due to worsening multi-organ failure, the patient was transferred to our institution. On arrival, she was unconscious, jaundiced, and exhibited cutaneous and mucosal bruising, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. She was in shock with a systolic blood pressure of 50mmHg and hypoglycemia (<20mg/dL). Her blood coagulation profile showed evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Arterial blood gas analysis and a metabolic panel showed evidence of lactic acidosis. A complete blood count demonstrated marked leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 63.9×103/?L, severe anemia (hemoglobin, 7.4g/L), and thrombocytopenia (platelet, 29×103/?L). Based on a review of her peripheral blood smear and flow cytometric analysis, she was diagnosed with leukemic phase of large B-cell lymphoma. A high-dose dexamethasone therapy was then administered. Despite the aggressive treatment and supportive care, the patient manifested progressive respiratory, renal, hepatic and cardiac failure, which ultimately led to her death 37h after admission to our institution (one week after her initial presentation to the local urgent care center). In order to determine the ultimate cause of death, consent for a complete autopsy was obtained from the patient's next of kin. "
2826,S0046-8177(12)00409-1,Lymphoid follicle colonization by Bcl-2bright+CD10+ B-cells (“follicular lymphoma in situ”) at nodal and extranodal sites can be a manifestation of follicular homing of lymphoma," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case selection We retrospectively searched our departmental database of FL cases from January 2002 to June 2012 to identify biopsies or surgical resection specimens of lymph nodes or extranodal tissue that were coded to document the presence of reactive follicles colonized by Bcl-2bright+CD10+ B-cells, as described by Cong et al [5]. Data regarding patient demographics, type of associated or subsequent lymphoma, results of imaging studies, therapeutic regimens and clinical outcomes were obtained from our laboratory and clinical information systems. This study was approved by our institutional review board.   2.2 Morphology and immunohistochemistry Morphologic features were evaluated by reviewing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a panel of antibodies. Staining for CD20 (clone MJ1), CD3 (clone LN10), Bcl-6 (clone LN22), Bcl-2 (clone BCL-2/100/D) (all Novocastra, Buffalo Grove, Illinois), MUM1 (clone MUM1p) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), LMO2 (clone SP51), OCT2 (clone MRQ-2), and BOB1 (clone SP92) (all Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA) was performed after antigen retrieval at pH 9.0 for 20 min, using the Leica Bond III autostainer (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Staining for CD10 (clone SP67), CD21 (clone EP3093), and Ki-67 (clone 30–9) (all Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) was performed after antigen retrieval at pH 8.3 for 30 minutes, using the Ventana Ultra platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). The Bond Polymer Refine Detection (Leica) or the Ultra View Universal DAB Detection Kit (Ventana) was used for visualization, with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen.   2.3 Cytogenetic analysis G-band karyotype analysis was performed on metaphase preparations after unstimulated overnight cultures, and karyotypes were described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature [13]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on metaphase spreads and/or FFPE sections using IGH/BCL2 dual color fusion and/or BCL2 break-apart probes (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL), per standard protocols. FISH analysis for BCL6, and MYC (Abbott Molecular) was performed as applicable. Fluorescence signals were analyzed using the Cytovision Imaging system attached to a Nikon Eclipse 600 microscope (Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, CA), and 200–500 cells were scored for each hybridization. To evaluate tissue localization of FISH signals, FFPE sections from 9 cases containing only reactive follicles manifesting the Bcl-2bright+CD10+ B-cell colonization pattern were selected, and coordinates of abnormal follicles targeted for FISH signal detection were marked on the underside of the slides after reviewing corresponding serial H&E stained sections.   2.4 Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement analysis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to ascertain clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) rearrangements was performed on DNA extracted from fresh or FFPE tissue using the BIOMED-2 primers, as described [14] followed by high resolution capillary electrophoresis using a 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

2840,S2152-2650(13)00437-0,Central Nervous System Involvement in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma: 2 Illustrative Cases and a Review of Current Literature," Cases and Introduction  Case 1 A 64-year-old woman with longstanding facial and body eczematous dermatitis presented with large ulcerating masses on the neck and right upper eyelid as well as multiple erythematous scaly plaques on the trunk and extremities (Fig. 1A ). Skin biopsy and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement studies were consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), mycosis fungoides (MF) type (CTCL/MF). Dermatopathology showed psoriasiform dermatitis with an epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate with enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei. Flow cytometry revealed that the atypical T cells were CD3 positive (CD3+) and CD4+, with loss of CD8, CD5, and CD7 positivity and only rare CD30 positivity. A clonal TCR gamma chain gene rearrangement was found by PCR. Peripheral blood flow cytometry was negative for circulating atypical lymphocytes. During the patient's evaluation, the tumor over the right orbit rapidly enlarged and ulcerated (see Fig. 1B). She developed neurologic symptoms including a subtle left hemiparesis, left-sided limb ataxia, mild intention tremor, and difficulty with cognition and word finding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed minimal contrast enhancement; however, the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence revealed a large right hemispheric signal abnormality in the right centrum semiovale (Fig. 2A, B ). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology and flow cytometry were negative for infection or tumor. Brain biopsy was recommended to the patient, but she declined. Based on the clinical scenario, the cancer was staged as IVB CTCL/MF with parenchymal central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The patient underwent electron beam radiation therapy with a cumulative dose of 36 Gy to her cutaneous tumors, with significant shrinkage of these masses (see Fig. 1C, D). After the development of neurologic signs and symptoms, she was treated with oral dexamethasone and high-dose intravenous methotrexate (HD-MTX) (8 g/m2). She completed 8 cycles of HD-MTX (4 cycles administered once every 2 weeks and subsequently 4 cycles once every 4 weeks) with complete resolution of neurologic symptoms and normalization of brain MRI changes (see Fig. 2C, D). The patient's patch-stage skin lesions initially improved with HD-MTX but slowly recurred off therapy. Maintenance chemotherapy with oral bexarotene was started, which was changed to intravenous romidepsin therapy after she developed additional cutaneous tumors. One year after her initial presentation, the patient is fully functional in her daily activities, with a normal neurologic examination, and has stable cutaneous disease. Follow-up brain MRI found no evidence of recurrent or residual metastasis.   Case 2 A 52-year-old man with a medical history including coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with intermittent, progressive, painful erythematous papules and plaques on the upper chest and upper extremities over 2 years (Fig. 3A ). Concurrent with the skin eruption, he developed episodic but progressive weakness ultimately resulting in C5 asymmetric tetraplegia that necessitated the use of a motorized wheelchair. Before presentation at the authors' institution, he had been treated with multiple courses of high-dose pulse intravenous methylprednisolone for presumed idiopathic transverse myelitis, with temporary improvement of skin lesions and leg weakness after each treatment course. Subsequently a skin biopsy found an atypical dermal lymphoid infiltrate with an abnormal immunophenotype revealing a CD3+, CD4+ T-cell infiltrate with decreased expression of CD2 and CD7. CD25, CD30, and CD56 were negative. TCR gene rearrangement studies confirmed the presence of a T-cell clone. Brain MRI showed patchy small-volume bihemispheric parenchymal lesions in the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments. Spine MRI found extensive cervical and lumbar leptomeningeal and parenchymal enhancement and associated subarachnoid nodules (see Fig. 3B, C, D). CSF analysis found elevated glucose and protein, with the presence of atypical lymphocytes. CSF flow cytometry confirmed an abnormal T-cell population with an immunophenotype similar to that of the skin, with a low level also detected in the peripheral blood. Based on the presence of the same TCR clone in the skin, CSF, and blood, the patient was diagnosed with CTCL (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified) with brain and spine parenchymal and leptomeningeal involvement. The patient was treated with pulse-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin, followed by HD-MTX, 8 g/m2, for 6 cycles (each cycle administered every 2 weeks). Repeat MRI imaging showed minimal response in the brain and spine, although his neurologic examination remained stable. He was subsequently started on pemetrexed, 500 mg/m2, administered once every 3 weeks, a therapy administered on an outpatient basis. Six months after diagnosis of CTCL and with continued pemetrexed treatment, the patient remains neurologically stable with a modest clinical response and stable neuroradiographic disease.  "

HL often appears as nodal disease, with a predilection for neck and mediastinal nodes. 5-8  The prognosis is poorer in NHL, because in most cases, the disease has widely spread at the time of diagnosis. 9  The 5-year survival rates are 73% for HLs and 65% for extranodal NHLs of the head and neck. 3,10  "
2867,S2152-2650(12)00253-4,Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas Presenting as Soft Tissue Masses: A Single Center Experience and Meta-Analysis of the Published Series," Patients and Methods  Definition of Soft Tissue and Criteria for the Diagnosis of Soft Tissue Lymphoma Soft tissue is defined as tissue that connects, supports, or surrounds other structures such as adipose tissue, connective tissue, and skeletal muscle, excluding bone. In this review only patients with soft tissue involvement at the moment of initial diagnosis were considered. The criteria for the definition of primary soft tissue lymphoma were originally described by Lanham et al 3 , and are as follows: soft tissue involvement, no previous history of lymphoma, no more than 2 locations including nodes and extranodal sites, no masses in the thoracic or abdominal cavities or visceral organs, no groin, face, retroperitoneum, skin, bone, or axilla involvement, no lymph node structure observed in the biopsy specimen, and no evidence of disease spread after 3 months from initial diagnosis. In all cases the histologic material for the initial diagnosis originated from a soft tissue mass.   Single Center Experience Sixteen consecutive patients with histologically confirmed soft tissue lymphomas of different histologies treated at our center between January 1996 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Only patients with soft tissue involvement at disease onset were considered. All histologic materials were reviewed by a pathologist (SP) from our institution. All patients were evaluated by full clinical history, physical examination, total body computed tomography (CT) scan, complete blood cell count with leukocyte differential, and bone marrow biopsy as part of the initial staging. MRI scan was also employed in order to better evaluate soft tissue masses. All patients with DLBCL diagnosed after 2002 underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as part of the initial staging workup. Additionally, patients were tested for blood chemistry (including creatinine, liver function tests, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase) and underwent urine analysis and electrocardiography. Patients younger than 65 years of age were treated using CHOP-21 (cyclophosphamide, Adriamicin, vincristine, prednisone) or MACOP-B (methotrexate, Adriamicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Bleomicin, prednisone) regimens (with or without rituximab). CHOP-21 and MACOP-B (with or without rituximab) regimens were given, respectively every 3 weeks and on a weekly basis, as previously described. 11–13  Elderly patients (65 years and older) were treated using the R-VNCOP-B (vincristine, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, Bleomicin, vp-16, prednisone) regimen, as previously described. 14  All therapies were given on outpatient basis. Radiation therapy was given as initial therapy in patients with nonbulky stage IE soft tissue lymphoma, or 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy in patients with bulky presentation, with a tumor dose ranging from 30 to 36 Gy over 3 to 4 weeks using a schedule of 180 cGy per day for 5 days per week. Restaging was done at least 4 weeks after the completion of the last chemotherapy cycle and 12 weeks after the last radiotherapy course with total body CT scan, MRI, bone marrow biopsy when positive at the disease onset, and FDG-PET scan when feasible. Responses were classified according to the International Workshop for Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphomas 15  plus the FDG-PET implication data. 16   Follow-up assessments were repeated every 3 months during the first year and every 6 months starting from the third to the fifth year, and every 12 to 18 months for further follow-up. All patients signed a written informed consent and the study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the institutional review board.   Literature Meta-analysis A systematic search of the available literature from 1990 to 2011 was conducted in the PubMed database. Keywords used for the literature search were soft tissue lymphoma, extranodal lymphoma, primary extranodal lymphoma, and skeletal muscle lymphoma. Because of the lack of published clinical trials on this issue, all studies describing patients affected by soft tissue lymphomas, with available information on patient characteristics, treatment strategies, and follow-up (at least 6 months), including case series and case reports, were included in this analysis. The accuracy of this meta-analysis was assessed using the checklist of items in accordance with the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.' 17     Selection Criteria We considered patients treated during the past 2 decades to have comparable data regarding both histologic classifications and treatment. For our single-center experience, we selected consecutive patients with histologically proven soft tissue lymphoma at the disease onset, diagnosed and subsequently treated in our institution, using the electronic archive of our hemolymphopathology unit (data available from 1996).   Statistical Analysis The primary end points were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS was defined as the time from registration to the first observation of progressive disease or death as a result of disease progression. OS was defined as the time from registration to the observation of death as a result of any cause. The results of the study were analyzed statistically using the SPSS 8.0 software program (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Differences between groups were evaluated by using the log-rank test and OS and PFS curves were plotted by the Kaplan–Meier method. 18  A P value ? .05 was considered statistically significant.  "

2895,S0021-9975(03)00119-1,An Immunohistochemical Investigation of 18 Cases of Feline Nasal Lymphoma," 2 Materials and Methods  2.1 Biopsy Material Nasal mucosal tissue was submitted for routine histopathological diagnosis from 18 cats with nasal lymphoma between 1996 and 2003. Biopsy samples from 13 cats were submitted to the histopathology laboratory at the University of Bristol, the other five samples being submitted to the equivalent laboratory at the University of Cambridge. After fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, tissues were processed by routine methods for preparation of haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections for light microscopy. Clinical details of each case were retrieved from the case records at each institution.   2.2 Immunohistochemistry Thirteen samples were immunohistochemically labelled at the University of Bristol, with a panel of cross-reactive antisera specific for the T-lymphocyte marker CD3, the B-lymphocyte and plasma cell marker CD79a, class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and the antigen MAC 387 (calprotectin). MHC class II is expressed by B lymphocytes in addition to classical antigen-presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells), and MAC387 is expressed by neutrophils and a subset of macrophages. Five samples were immunohistochemically labelled at the University of Cambridge, with only the antisera specific for CD3 and CD79a. The methodology employed by the two laboratories was equivalent, and details are given below for the procedure as performed at the University of Bristol. A set of serial unstained sections (5 ?m) was prepared on slides coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-silane. These were hydrated through graded alcohols and treated with hydrogen peroxide 0.5% in methanol for 30 min to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing in distilled water, the sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by boiling for 6 min in citrate buffer (pH 6.0, 0.01 M) at half power in a 750-watt microwave oven. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.01 M), sections were incubated with normal goat serum (diluted 1 in 5 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature in a humid chamber. The sections were again washed in PBS before incubation with the panel of primary antisera (each diluted in PBS) for 3 h at room temperature. The antisera used were: rabbit anti-human CD3 (diluted 1 in 200; Dako, High Wycombe, UK), mouse anti-human HLA DR (diluted 1 in 20; Dako), mouse anti-human MAC 387 (diluted 1 in 20; Dako) and mouse anti-human CD79a (diluted 1 in 20; Dako). Two negative control sections were incubated with either normal rabbit serum or normal mouse serum (each diluted 1 in 800) at this stage. After primary incubation, sections were washed in PBS before application of the appropriate secondary antibody for a 30-min period at room temperature. These secondary antisera were either biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (diluted 1 in 20; Sigma Chemical Company, Poole, Dorset, UK) or biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1 in 20; Sigma). After a further PBS wash, all sections were incubated with avidin–conjugated horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1 in 20; Sigma). Finally, immunolabelling was “visualized” by applying 0.05% 3,3? diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide for 2 min. Slides were washed with distilled water and counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin before being dehydrated through graded alcohols and mounted under DPX.  "

There were no B symptoms. He finally sought medical attention in July 2008 with an Otolaryngologist: nasopharyngolaryngoscopy showed a mass in right supraglottic region. Clinical examination was otherwise unremarkable. The biopsy revealed an extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type. Staging PET-CT showed a hyper-metabolic soft tissue lesion in the region of the right false cord. There were no other abnormalities noted, thus confirming the diagnosis of stage IAE extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of the supraglottis, with an international prognostic index (IPI) score of 1."
2909,S0090-8258(03)00229-4,A case of malignant lymphoma of the ovary manifesting like an advanced ovarian cancer," Case report A 47-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, visited our hospital with complaints of abdominal distension for a month. Her height was 155 cm and her weight was 45 kg, but had increased by 2 kg in 5 months. A physical examination revealed that the abdominal wall was elevated by tumor and ascitic fluid. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral abdominal tumors, each measuring 10 cm in diameter, uterine myoma measuring 5 cm in diameter, thickened omentum, and a large amount of ascitic fluid, but no enlarged lymph nodes (Fig. 1).  A metastatic ovarian tumor was suspected because of the bilateral solid tumors and positive cytology of the ascitic fluid, but no primary lesion was found by any other examination. The serum tumor markers were positive for CA 125, 2,448 U/ml (normal range, <35 U/ml); lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), 1,323 IU/L (180–460 IU/L); and negative for CA 19-9, 26.1 U/ml (<37 U/ml); carcinoembryonic antigen, 1.0 ng/ml (<5 ng/ml); and ?-feto-protein, 2.6 ng/ml (<20 ng/ml). As the discomfort was getting worse, the patient was explored with an abdominal vertical midline incision. The peritoneum contained 2,500 ml of serous ascitic fluid, two 10-cm multinodular masses with elongated Fallopian tubes, and diffuse nodular lesions on the surface of the peritoneum. The omentum was diffusely involved by the tumor, with changes showing tumor caking (Fig. 2).  Tumors were adherent to adjacent organs and could not to be removed. The biopsy specimen was taken from the peritoneum lesion above the bladder. The liver and diaphragm were not involved macroscopically. The histology of the frozen section was suspicious for undifferentiated carcinoma. The peritoneal cavity was washed thoroughly with physiological saline solution. Drainage tubes (5 mm in diameter) for the intraperitoneal administration of anticancer drugs were fixed in the peritoneal cavity through the abdominal wall. A mixture of 100 mg of cisplatin, 400 mg of etoposide, and 1,000 ml of physiological saline solution was administered into the peritoneal cavity during 15 min, 2 h after surgery for the prevention of reaccumulation of the ascitic fluid. The intraperitoneal administration was repeated 2 weeks later, and drainage tubes were then extracted. Ultrasonography revealed that the tumor size was clearly reduced, and the ascitic fluid had disappeared. The size of the uterine myoma was not changed. The definite pathologic diagnosis after immunostaining was diffuse, large-cell malignant lymphoma of B-cell lineage. Workup for the lymphoma after surgery included repeated abdominal and thoracic computed tomographic scans, bone scintigraphy, systemic gallium scintigraphy and bone marrow biopsies, and aspirations. The findings from all these studies showed no other site involved. The clinical stage was IV according to the Ann Arbor system and IIIc according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. The patient later received an additional CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m2 day 1; doxorubicin, 50 mg/m2 day 1; vincristine, 1.4 mg/m2 day 1; prednisone, 50 mg/m2 days 1–5) 8 times, intravenously. The accumulation of ascitic fluid stopped and the serum CA 125 level gradually decreased to normal. At the end of the chemotherapy, MRI showed that the ovarian tumors and omental tumor had disappeared and the uterine myoma was reduced to 2 cm in diameter. The patient is alive without disease 72 months after the first chemotherapy without additional surgery. In the cytology of the ascitic fluid, the tumor cells were large noncleaved with pleomorphic nuclei, finely dispersed nuclear chromatin, and multiple nucleoli (Fig. 3).   Microscopic examination revealed the diffuse growth pattern of tumor cells with large vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 4).   Paraffin immunostaining studies showed strong positivity of the neoplastic cells for CD20 (L-26) and CD45RA (MB-1). Tumor cells were negative for the T-cell markers CD43 (MT-1) and CD45RO (UCHL-1). No immunoreactivity was noted with staining for the following markers: synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and vimentin. These findings were in favor of diffuse large-cell malignant lymphoma of B-cell lineage. "
2918,S2152-2650(13)00244-9,Bendamustine and Rituximab for Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Patients With Compensated Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: A Case Series," Introduction Bendamustine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with indolent non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) that has progressed during or within 6 months of use of a rituximab-containing regimen, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite a history of use spanning 5 decades, the pharmacology of bendamustine is not fully understood and has elements of alkylating and antimetabolite agent (via its benzimidazole ring) mechanisms of action. Bendamustine generates single- and double-strand DNA breaks that appear to last longer than other alkylating agents thereby enhancing cytotoxicity. This lack of cross-resistance makes bendamustine an attractive candidate for relapsed indolent B-cell neoplasms previously treated with other alkylating agents. 1   The efficacy of bendamustine in combination with rituximab as a first-line therapy in CLL and subtypes of indolent NHL has been evaluated. A single arm phase II study demonstrated an overall response rate of 88% and a complete response in 23%, with progression-free survival of 34 months and manageable toxicity. 2  These data led to an ongoing trial of bendamustine/rituximab (BR) combination vs. “standard of care” FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) in CLL. 3  Similarly, after being found to have superior efficacy and tolerability compared with R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) in indolent B-cell lymphomas by the Study group indolent Lymphomas, it is currently considered a standard of care for indolent NHL. 4   Hepatitis C (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus implicated in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. In an epidemiologic metaanalysis, the pooled relative risk of NHL among HCV-positive individuals was 2.5 in case-control studies and 2.0 in cohort studies, without clear predilection for specific NHL subtypes. 5  The mechanism of HCV lymphoma induction is not certain, but might be multifactorial and influenced by non-HCV oncogenic signals. 6  Interestingly, 1 report indicates that NHL has been shown to regress with treatment directed only at HCV. 7   The bendamustine package insert advises caution in the setting of mild hepatic impairment and avoidance of the drug in patients with moderate (1.5-3 times the normal bilirubin and aminotranserase levels) to severe hepatic dysfunction (2.5-10 times normal liver indices). 8  However, 26 patients with mild hepatic impairment were administered the 120 mg/m2 dose of bendamustine without any effect on pharmacokinetics. 8  The overlap of HCV-associated liver damage (which can be severe) and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, best treated with bendamustine-containing regimens, underscores the value of case reports that document outcomes in this population. We searched PUBMED and the American Society of Hematology Abstracts from 2007 to 2012, combining the term “bendamustine” with the terms “hepatitis”, “liver”, “hepatic”, and “cirrhosis”. No case reports or studies in NHL were found. Wiedmann et al reported on 5 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who received off-label bendamustine 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of a 28-day cycle, and 5 additional patients with cholangiocarcinoma who received 140 mg/m2 bendamustine as a single dose. Grade 3 liver toxicity was found in three patients, two with underlying alcoholic cirrhosis and one with a prior right hepatectomy. 9   We searched PUBMED and the American Society of Hematology Abstracts from 2007-2012, combining the term “bendamustine” with the terms “hepatitis”, “liver”, “hepatic”, and “cirrhosis”. No case reports or studies in NHL were found. Wiedmann et al reported on five patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who received off-label bendamustine 100mg/m2 on days one and two of a 28 day cycle and five additional patients with cholangiocarcinoma with 140mg/m2 bendamustine as a single dose. Grade 3 liver toxicity was found in 3 patients, 2 with underlying alcoholic cirrhosis and 1 with a previous right hepatectomy. 9   Based on available data, we chose BR for use in 2 patients (1 case each of CLL and NHL) with HCV complicated by biopsy-proven cirrhosis, and herein report the favorable outcomes. We hope that these reports will be helpful for physicians seeking to balance benefits and risks in similar complicated patients. "
2921,S0046-8177(04)00038-3,Expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in soft tissue tumors: An immunohistochemical and molecular study of 249 cases,"Aberrant ALK expression induced by gene rearrangements was identified initially in a proportion of ALCLs,1,5–16 later in some inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs),15,17–27 and most recently in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.28,29 In these neoplasms, due to the chromosomal translocations involving 2p23, a distal portion (including sequences encoding the intracytoplasmic domains) of the ALK gene is fused with a proximal part of a non-RTK gene located elsewhere, leading to the constitutive expression of a chimeric ALK protein. In addition to the nucleophosmin (NPM) at 5q35,1 other variant ALK fusion partners have been identified, including tropomyosin (TPM) 3 and 4, TRK-fused gene (TFG), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), moesin (MSN), ALK lymphoma oligomerization partner on chromosome 17 (ALO17), cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS), Ran-binding protein 2, and the non-muscle myosin heavy chain (MYH9), which are located at 1q25, 3q21, 2q35, 19p13.1, 17q23, Xq11–12, 17q25, 11p15, 2q13, and 22q11.2.8–16,18,21,23,26–29 Interestingly, with the exception of MSN-ALK and MYH9-ALK, the breakpoints of the various ALK rearrangements are located in the same intron of the ALK gene."
2926,S0016-5107(01)70070-3,Duodenal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma treated by eradication of Helicobacter pylori: Report of 2 cases including EUS findings," Case reports  Case 1 A 65-year-old woman was admitted because of abdominal discomfort. Examination was negative for hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Laboratory data and imaging studies, including bone marrow aspiration, chest and abdominal CT, and gallium scintigraphy, were normal. Upper endoscopy disclosed irregular granular mucosa with mucosal defects in the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb (Fig. 1A).   Fig. 1  Case 1. A, Chromoendoscopic view (0.2% indigo carmine solution) showing irregular granular mucosa with mucosal defects on anterior wall of duodenal bulb. B, Photomicrograph of duodenal biopsy specimen showing diffuse infiltration of centrocyte-like cells with lymphoepithelial lesions (H&E, orig. mag. ×400). C, EUS image of focal thickening of second sonographic layer of duodenal wall with preservation of third layer (arrows). D, Endoscopic view 6 weeks after conclusion of eradication therapy showing regression of duodenal lesions.    Although no abnormalities were evident in the stomach at endoscopy, the presence of H pylori infection was confirmed by histology, culture, and a rapid urease test. Histologic examination of the biopsy from the duodenal lesion disclosed diffuse infiltration by centrocyte-like cells with lymphoepithelial lesions in the lamina propria (Fig. 1B). Immunostaining of the tumor cells with the B-cell marker CD20 was positive. EUS with a 20 MHz catheter US probe (GF-UM3R, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) demonstrated focal thickening of the second sonographic layer of the duodenal wall, but the third layer seemed to be well preserved (Fig. 1C). These findings suggested that the lymphoma was restricted to the mucosa or to the superficial portion of the submucosa. 14  Periduodenal lymph node enlargement was not observed. Based on these findings, a diagnosis was made of primary duodenal MALT lymphoma, stage EI1 according to the Ann-Arbor system as modified by the German MALT Lymphoma Study Group. 12,13   The patient was treated with a 2-week course of orally administered rabeprazole (20 mg/day), amoxicillin (1500 mg/day), clarithromycin (600 mg/day), and metronidazole (500 mg/day) to eradicate the infection. Endoscopy 6 weeks after the conclusion of the treatment regimen showed that the duodenal lesion had improved (Fig. 1D). Biopsies disclosed mildly inflamed duodenal mucosa without evidence of residual lymphoma cells. Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained and histology, culture, and a rapid urease test were negative for H pylori.   Case 2 A 48-year-old asymptomatic woman was referred for a general health evaluation. Examination and laboratory data, including abdominal CT and gallium scintigraphy, disclosed no abnormalities. Upper endoscopy revealed a normal-appearing stomach, but there were granular areas with ulceration in the duodenal bulb (Fig. 2A).   Fig. 2  Case 2. A, Chromoendoscopic view (0.2% indigo carmine solution) showing granular areas with ulceration in duodenal bulb. B, EUS imaging showing hypoechoic mass within second and third sonographic layers. C, EUS image obtained 8 weeks after H pylori eradication showing residual hypoechoic tumor within second and third sonographic layers.    Biopsy specimens from the lesion revealed dense infiltration by CD20-positive centrocyte-like cells and lymphoepithelial lesions. EUS demonstrated a hypoechoic mass in the second and third sonographic layers of the duodenal wall (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the tumor had massively invaded the deep portion of the submucosa. 14  However, there was no periduodenal lymphadenopathy. Based on these findings, a diagnosis was made of primary duodenal MALT lymphoma, stage EI1. 12,13  Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained and histology, culture, and a rapid urease test were positive for H pylori infection. The patient was treated with a 2-week course of orally administered rabeprazole (20 mg/day), amoxicillin (1500 mg /day), and clarithromycin (600 mg/day). Eight weeks after completion of the treatment regimen a  13 C breath test was negative. Although follow-up endoscopy at this time demonstrated eradication of H pylori (negative histology, culture, and rapid urease test) granular areas were still present in the duodenal bulb. A large number of remnant lymphoma cells were identified in duodenal biopsy specimens. EUS revealed residual hypoechoic tumor within the second and the third sonographic layers (Fig. 2C). An alternative therapy, oral monochemotherapy with cyclophophamide, was recommended to the patient. 9    "
2933,S0145-2126(03)00253-4,T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma: a clinicopathologic study of 21 cases and comparison with 43 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma," 2 Patients and methods  2.1 Patient population The cases were selected from the lymphoma specimens diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2001 at the Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty. Twenty-four cases of TCRBCL and 288 cases of DLBCL were identified. Two of the patients with TCRBCL had a prior diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin’s disease (NLPHD) in another institution. Complete follow-up information was available in 21 patients with TCRBCL. Forty-three patients with DLBCL, who were diagnosed during the same period and had complete follow-up information, were selected for comparison. Histological evaluation was based on B5 or formalin fixed tissue sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In 24 patients, diagnosis of TCRBCL was based on the criteria of current WHO classification [4], the most important being a diffuse growth pattern with a greater than 90% reactive T cells amidst a minority (<10%) of neoplastic large B cells. Immunostaining of fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections by the streptavidin–biotin complex technique used the following antibodies CD20 (L26, NeoMarkers), polyclonal anti-CD3 (DAKO), CD45RO (UCHL1, NeoMarkers), CD15 (LeuM1, DAKO), EMA (NeoMarkers) and CD30 (Ber-H2, DAKO). All patients with TCRBCL and DLBCL had unilateral bone marrow (BM) examinations. Criteria for bone marrow involvement included the presence of mass-like lesions with scattered large malignant lymphoid cells [14]. The clinical records and follow-up data were retrieved through chart review from the Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine of the same faculty. The extent of the disease was studied by physical examination, computerised tomographic scan of the chest and abdomen and bone marrow biopsy. The number of extra-nodal sites and the diameter of the largest tumor mass were determined. Patients were staged according to the Ann Arbor classification [16]. Performance status was assessed according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale (0–4) [15]. Serum LDH level was expressed as the ratio over the maximum normal value. On the basis of these clinical data, the IPI score [15] was determined for all patients. Nineteen patients with TCRBCL and all patients with DLBCL were treated with combination chemotherapy (i.e. cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone [CHOP]). Additionally, involved-field radiation treatment was given to four patients with TCRBCL and four patients with DLBCL, who had initially bulky disease. Two patients with TCRBCL (patient nos. 20 and 21) who initially diagnosed with NLPHL received ABVD regimen. The evaluation of response was performed according to the standards of the Report of the International Workshop criteria for non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas [17].   2.2 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 10.0 software. Patient characteristics and complete remission rates were compared by ? 2-tests. The overall survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up visit or death. Event-free survival was measured from the end of treatment to the date of first relapse. The rates of survival were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier [18] and compared by Log-rank test [19].  "

2949,S1878-8750(12)00881-9,Atypical Presentation of Primary Central Nervous System Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Immunocompetent Young Adults," Case Reports We report two cases of intraventricular PCNSL in young, immunocompetent patients.  Case Report 1  History A 27-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with 10 days of headache, nausea, vomiting, and progressive confusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed obstructive hydrocephalus and a hypercellular left intraventricular mass versus atypical hemorrhage ( Figure 1  ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the intraventricular mass without sign of associated hemorrhage ( Figure 2  ).   Operation and Pathologic Findings A right frontal external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed emergently. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sent for cytology and flow cytometry. Pathologic evaluation was consistent with DLBCL.   Postoperative Course Once the diagnosis of PCNSL was made, a subsequent complete workup was negative for systemic lymphoma. The patient was started on high dose dexamethasone and methotrexate with leucovorin rescue and rituximab. He also received two doses of DepoCyte (liposomal cytarabine) through the EVD. His hydrocephalus improved with chemotherapy and the EVD was subsequently removed and replaced with a CSF reservoir for continued intrathecal therapy and long-term surveillance. Follow-up CSF analysis remains negative for malignancy. At 1-month follow-up MRI showed resolution of the intraventricular mass ( Figure 3  ). The patient remains neurologically intact and CSF remains negative 1 year after diagnosis.    Case Report 2  History A 31-year-old woman presented with severe headache, vision difficulties, and ataxia. Initially she presented to an outside hospital 1 year prior where she was found to have a septum pellucidum mass and obstructive hydrocephalus. She underwent placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and biopsy of the mass. Pathology was inconclusive but was believed to be consistent with a benign behaving process such as a central neurocytoma. Her symptoms completely resolved and she was followed closely. A year later, she subsequently became pregnant and once again began to develop headaches and ataxia. Imaging at that time showed a dramatic increase in the size of the lesion ( Figure 4  ). She was transferred due to the complexity of her situation with the tumor and her second trimester pregnancy.   Operation and Pathologic Findings Because of the large increase in the size of the mass, the patient elected to proceed with craniotomy and tumor resection. It was thought that this may be a central neurocytoma. The frozen section analysis of the tumor intraoperatively was consistent with lymphoma. After intraoperative consultation with members of the neuro-oncology department, due to significant mass effect and her pregnancy, the decision was made to resect as much tumor as safely possible. Postoperative Course. A complete workup for systemic lymphoma was negative. After much discussion, the patient proceeded with termination of her pregnancy to undergo systemic treatment. She underwent chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, vincristine, and procarbazine and subsequent 2450 cGy whole brain radiation followed by two more rounds of cytarabine. She did not receive intrathecal chemotherapy. Her follow-up imaging showed resolution ( Figure 5  ). She tolerated therapy well and remained recurrence free 3 years after pathologic diagnosis. She was then lost to follow-up as she continued her care locally.   "
2960,S1470-2045(18)30082-2,"Umbralisib, a novel PI3K? and casein kinase-1? inhibitor, in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoma: an open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation, first-in-human study"," Methods  Study design and participants We did this open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation study at seven clinics in the USA (appendix p1). We recruited eligible patients aged 18 years and older with histologically confirmed B-cell or T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including peripheral T-cell lymphoma), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, or small lymphocytic lymphoma, or Hodgkin's lymphoma whose disease had relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least one previous treatment regimen. Patients had to have either a washout period of 21 days from previous surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy, or whichever was shorter of 21 days or five half-lives from a previous investigational drug. Patients who had previously received any PI3K or mTOR inhibitor were not eligible for the dose-escalation cohorts but were allowed to enrol in dose-expansion cohorts. We classed patients as refractory if they had disease progression at or within 6 months of their last previous therapy. Eligible patients were required to have measurable or assessable disease as defined by criteria from the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 18  or revised response criteria from the 2007 International Working Group; 19  an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2; a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; and adequate organ system function, including an absolute neutrophil cell count of at least 750 per ?L, and a platelet count of at least 50?000 per ?L. Patients were excluded if they were currently receiving cancer therapy or had undergone autologous haematological stem cell transplant within 3 months of study entry or allogeneic haematological stem cell transplant within 12 months of entry; if they were known to be infected with hepatitis B or C, or HIV; or if they had primary CNS lymphoma or known intracranial involvement (for patients asessable for dose-limiting toxicities only), spinal cord compression due to disease, known history of liver injury or disease, or any other severe or uncontrolled medical conditions that could affect their participation. Full exclusion criteria are in the appendix p 2. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was done in compliance with good clinical practice and local and national regulatory guidelines. An institutional review board at each site approved the protocol before any patients were enrolled.   Procedures Umbralisib was self-administered by patients orally as tablets once daily in 28-day cycles, with dose escalation done in a traditional 3?+?3 design (with at least three patients enrolled into each dose level cohort) to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Patients took the tablets at home except on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2 when pharmcokinetic data were collected; on those days, patients took the tablet at the centre. 12 additional patients were to be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose to confirm safety. Dose-limiting toxicities for each dose were assessed in cycle 1 (in the dose-escalation part of the cycle). In the initial cohorts, umbralisib tablets were self-administered in a fasting state at a dose of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, or 1800 mg once daily until the maximum tolerated dose was identified or the maximal dose cohort was accrued without any dose-limiting toxicities recorded. Patients were assigned to a specific dose cohort and knew what dose they were taking. If they were dose escalated per the intrapatient dose-escalation guidelines, they had to come to the study centre to receive additional tablets to take the higher dose. On the basis of results from studies of food-effect and formulation-effect pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, 13  which showed a positive effect of administering umbralisib in the fed state and increased absorption with the use of a micronised drug product, a second dose escalation was done in which a micronised, particle-size formulation of umbralisib tablets was self-administered in a fed state at an initial dose of 200 mg, and increased in increments (to 400, 800, 1200, and 1800 mg) until the maximum tolerated dose was identified or the maximal dose level was accrued. This was a protocol amendment made on April 1, 2014, that was approved by the study chair and sponsor. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis with antibiotics was permitted but not mandated during this study. Umbralisib treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Intrapatient dose escalation was allowed at investigator discretion for patients in earlier cohorts following establishment of safety at higher doses up to the maximum tolerated dose. If haematological toxicities of grade 2 or worse occurred, dosing was held until resolution of the toxicity to grade 2 or less, with a dose reduction permitted if warranted at investigator discretion. For non-haematological toxicities worse than grade 2 in severity, dosing was held until the toxicity resolved to less than grade 2, with dose reduction permitted if the event was initially grade 4. Patients were removed from the study if their treatment was delayed by more than 2 weeks during the first six cycles of therapy, or if they experienced recurrent toxicity after rechallenging at a lower dose. Laboratory parameters (complete blood counts plus differentials and platelets and chemistry panels) were assessed weekly during cycles 1–2, every other week during cycles 3–4, and on day 1 of cycles 5 and beyond, if there was a scheduled visit. Adverse events were recorded at each visit and were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Dose-limiting toxicities were defined as: grade 4 anaemia; grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting longer than 7 days; grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia; grade 3 or worse thrombocytopenia occurring with haemorrhage worse than grade 2; grade 3 or worse non-haematological toxicity (except for diarrhoea or nausea that resolved to ?grade 2 within 48 h, or an increase in alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] that resolved to grade 2 or less within 7 days); a treatment delay lasting at least 14 days because of unresolved toxicity; or any grade 2 non-haematological toxicity that was judged by the investigator, study chair, or medical monitor to be dose limiting. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, haematological toxicities were graded according to updated IWCLL guidelines, 18  and any grade 4 toxicity lasting for longer than 7 days was considered a dose-limiting toxicity. Patients who had a dose-limiting toxicity during cycle 1 or an adverse event after cycle 1 that met criteria to be classed as a dose-limiting toxicity were allowed to delay study treatment for up to 2 weeks, resuming umbralisib at the next lower dose after the toxicity had resolved to grade 1 or lower, or baseline. If toxicity recurred, study treatment was discontinued. Response assessments were initially done after two cycles (8 weeks) and then every two cycles thereafter indefinitely, based on the advanced stage of patients who were anticipated to enter this study. After initial encouraging clinical activity was recorded, a later protocol amendment made on Dec 12, 2014, and approved by the study chair and sponsor, permitted assessments every 6 months after cycle 12 (and the establishment of encouraging activity) to occur every six cycles. Treatment response was assessed by CT (or PET as appropriate and per institutional standard of care) according to updated IWCLL guidelines for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for lymphoma patients. 19   Competition binding assays were done to assess umbralisib, idelalisib, and duvelisib against a panel of 442 kinases (DiscoveRx, KinomeScan, Fremont, CA, USA). These assays, which were not part of the main study, were done to understand the selectivity differences between umbralisib and previous generation inhibitors idelalisib and duvelisib. The results of increased selectivity for umbralisib supported the hypothesis that a more selective inhibitor with fewer off-target effects can be better tolerated clinically. Idelalisib and duvelisib were sourced from SelleckChem (Houston, TX, USA). Test compounds were prepared as 40-times concentrated stock solutions in 100% DMSO and directly diluted to a final concentration of 1 ?M. Kd were determined using an 11-point, three-times compound dilution series (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA, USA). For pharmacokinetic analyses, blood samples were collected immediately before drug administration, then at 0·5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after the first dose of umbralisib on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2 and 3. Umbralisib plasma concentrations were determined using a validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry method (NorthEast Bioanalytical Laboratories, Hamden, CT, USA). On the basis of the equipotency between umbralisib and idelalisib in published studies, 13  a minimum target exposure of 3000 ng/mL (5·25 ?M) for umbralisib was predetermined based on the approximate plasma concentrations observed at Cmax with idelalisib at its phase 3 dose of 150 mg twice daily. 20  The lower detection limit of umbralisib was 1·08 ng/mL (1·89 nM), with an interday assay accuracy and precision of 97·9% and 4·7%, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24), maximum drug concentration (Cmax), and accumulation ratio (cycle 2 day 1 AUC0–24:cycle 1 day 1 AUC0–24) were determined using standard non-compartmental methods (appendix p 2).   Outcomes The primary endpoints of the study were investigator-assessed safety, the maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose at which one or fewer of six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity during one cycle of treatment), and the pharmacokinetics of umbralisib. Secondary end—points were investigator-assessed activity, measured as the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (complete response or partial response according to updated IWCLL guidelines for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and according to the revised IWG response criteria for patients with lymphoma) and the duration of response (defined as the time from the first documented response to disease progression or death from any cause).   Statistical analysis We did not do a formal sample size calculation for this trial. We planned to do a classic 3?+?3 dose escalation and treat three to six patients at each dose level. As stated in the protocol, expansion of existing (cleared) cohorts would include patients for the collection of safety and efficacy information in support of study objectives. We planned to enrol up to 100 patients between the dose escalation cohorts and dose-expansion cohorts. Safety endpoints, including the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events, were investigator-assessed descriptively in the safety population, which comprised all patients who received the study drug. No inferential statistical analyses of the safety endpoints were done. Anti-cancer activity outcomes (objective responses and duration of response) were investigator assessed and evaluated descriptively in the safety population and in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included patients in the safety population who received at least 800 mg per day of the original formulation or any dose of the micronised formulation and had at least one response assessment. Duration of response was recorded as the duration from the first documented response to disease progression or death from any cause, with data assessed descriptively. Patients with no post-baseline activity assessment (even if they were in the safety population) were considered not assessable for anti-tumour activity. Progression-free survival was assessed in post-hoc exploratory analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method. In pharmacokinetic analyses, a Pearson correlation was calculated between dose and Cmax. Cmax, time to maximum drug concentration (Tmax), and trough drug concentration (Cmin) were determined by inspection of each individual plasma concentration-time curve profile. AUC0–24 was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule up to the last collection timepoint of the dosing interval. We used SAS version 9.4 for all statistical analyses.

The patient's history and systemic examination were unremarkable. A physical examination revealed external cervical erosion. Her Pap smear result was negative. On sonography (HDI 5000, Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA, USA) equipped with an end-viewing endovaginal 8-MHz transducer, a 2.8×2.0-cm-sized, multinodular smoothly lobulated heterogeneous mass in the uterine cervix was detected. It had complex echoic cystic portions with posterior enhancement and no calcifications (Figs. 1 and 2  ). The mass was well separated from the uterine body which was detected in diffuse adenomyosis. A multinodular lesion that invades the deep cervical stroma should be ruled out as a malignancy. A colposcopic biopsy was performed. On microscopic examination, there was diffuse infiltration of the stroma of the endocervical tissue by a monomorphic population of malignant lymphoid cells. The cells had round to ovoid, irregular nuclei with scanty cytoplasm (Fig. 3 ). Immunohistochemical study showed that the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for B cell markers (Fig. 4 ). The final pathologic results indicated malignant B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma in the uterine cervix. A whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the bones, lymph nodes, and both kidneys, all presumed lymphoma involvements (Fig. 5 ). The final diagnosis therefore was Ann Arbor and FIGO Stage IV high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. "

There was about 14×12cm2 mass lesion on right chest wall about 7cm lateral to nipple areola with a bleeding ulcer at its apex ( Figure 1). Clinically it was fixed to underlying pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles. Incision biopsy suggested a possibility of small cell tumor or NHL. CT chest showed a lesion of 15×12cm2 over right lateral chest wall with loss of fat planes with the underlying muscles ( Figure 2). Mediastinum was normal in appearance. CT abdomen, bone scan and bone marrow examination were normal. Wide excision of tumor was performed with a 2cm margin along with involved portions of muscles ( Figure 3). Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( Figure 4). The lymphoma cell was positive for LCA (leukocyte common antigen) and L26 (CD20) and negative for CD3 and CD45 marker in the immunohistochemical analysis. All the margins were free of tumor. Patient received adjuvant chemotherapy (CHOP regime) in the post-operative period. Patient is disease free after 18 months of follow-up. "

These cells appear either as small centrocyte-like cells or monocytoid B cells with frequent plasmacytoid differentiation. The presence of follicular dendritic cells is common. Follicular colonization and Dutcher bodies may be observed. The paucity of lymphoepithelial lesions is a slight difference compared with the typical gastric MALT lymphoma, and this is why the term “marginal zone B-cell lymphoma” has been preferred. 1,2,7  The results of immunohistochemistry analysis show an immunoglobulin light chain restriction in the B cells and the absence of expression of CD5, CD10, and CD23 antigens. 1,7  Molecular analysis 19  demonstrates the clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes; however, no abnormality of bcl-2 gene or other known oncogenes involved in lymphomas has been associated with MZL.

3032,S0272-6386(12)00930-4,Acute Kidney Injury and Bilateral Symmetrical Enlargement of the Kidneys as First Presentation of B-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma," Case Report  Clinical History and Initial Laboratory Data A 19-year-old previously healthy Chinese woman was admitted to our emergency department with AKI and bilateral nephromegaly. One month before admission, the patient developed fevers that reached 100.4°F. Three days later, she reported upper abdominal pain along with nausea and vomiting. Ten days before admission, she noted bilateral back pain and was admitted to the local hospital for evaluation. At that time, blood pressure was 210/150 mm Hg, height was 5?5?, weight was 192 lb, and body mass index was 31.6 kg/m2. Blood work showed serum urea nitrogen level of 40.6 mg/dL (14.5 mmol/L), creatinine level of 4.3 mg/dL (381mol/L), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 13.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.22 mL/s/1.73 m2) according to the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) Study equation modified for the Chinese population. 9  Computed tomography of the abdomen showed diffuse enlargement of both kidneys without nodular lesions, evidence of obstruction, or lymph node enlargement. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. After admission, the bilateral back pain increased markedly and extended to both legs. There was no jaundice, rash, bleeding or bruising, lymphadenopathy, or tonsillar enlargement. The patient's lower back was tender to palpation bilaterally, and large flank masses were felt bilaterally. Laboratory tests showed the following values: serum sodium, 139.3 mEq/L (139.3 mmol/L); potassium, 4.1 mEq/L (4.1 mmol/L); serum urea nitrogen, 35.7 mg/dL (12.7 mmol/L); creatinine, 5.6 mg/dL (495 ?mol/L); eGFR, 9.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.16 mL/s/1.73 m2); calcium, 2.29 mEq/L (1.15 mmol/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 527 U/L; uric acid, 10.3 mg/dL (611 ?mol/L); white blood cell count, 11.95×103/?L (11.95×109/L); hemoglobin, 12.9 g/dL (129 g/L); and platelets, 410×103/?L (410×109/L). Chest radiograph was normal, and echocardiography revealed left ventricular and ventricular septal hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 50%. An ultrasound showed that both kidneys were markedly enlarged, with the length of the right kidney 18.1 cm and the left, 19.2 cm, without hydronephrosis (Fig 1A).  The massively enlarged unobstructed kidneys strongly suggested an infiltrative process, and kidney biopsy was deemed crucial to the diagnosis. However, concern for hemorrhage of the enlarged and infiltrated kidneys during biopsy prompted deferment of this procedure. Instead, bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry were performed, with all examination findings unremarkable. Chest computed tomography and ultrasonography of superficial lymph nodes did not show abnormalities. Considering the high suspicion of renal interstitium infiltration causing AKI and treatment-resistant hypertension, a testing treatment of methylprednisolone (40 mg) was initiated, with prompt resolution of fever and abdominal pain. Six days later, serum creatinine level decreased to 1.3 mg/dL (112 ?mol/L; eGFR, 60.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 [1.01 mL/s/1.73 m2]), and kidney size on ultrasound decreased by nearly 2 cm. The patient's blood pressure decreased to 140/90 mm Hg on treatment with a calcium channel blocker and ?-blocker. She was discharged with oral prednisone, 30 mg daily, while awaiting a further decrease in kidney size. Twenty days later, the patient developed a toothache and symmetrical pain in both arms. Blood pressure increased to 240/140 mm Hg, and she was readmitted to the hospital. Serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL (99?mol/L; eGFR, 71.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 [1.18 mL/s/1.73 m2]), and kidney length increased to 19.2 (right) and 19.3 cm (left). MRI of the abdomen was performed.   Imaging Studies The images of both kidneys were similar to the previous ultrasound descriptions. However, retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement was now appreciated on MRI. Figures 2A and 2B show normal kidney magnetic resonance images. In Fig 2C, T1-weighted MRI showed symmetrical enlargement of the kidneys. In Fig 2D, T2-weighted imaging-fat saturation showed retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and enlarged hypointense signal kidneys with loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Diffusion-weighted imaging in Fig 2E showed hyperintense signal of the kidneys. Figure 2F shows a T2-weighted sagittal image with symmetrical enlargement of the kidneys.   Diagnosis Kidney biopsy was performed (18 gauge) without bleeding complication. Kidney pathology showed massive interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, which were unable to be differentiated by morphology (Fig 3A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (3+; Fig 3B), PAX5 (3+; Fig 3C), and Ki67 (>90%; Fig 3D) and negative for CD3 (Fig 3E), CD34 (Fig 3F), and CD20 (Fig 3G). This pattern is diagnostic of B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.   Clinical Follow-Up The patient received the VDCLP protocol (vincristine, daunomycin, cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, and dexamethasone) for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One week after chemotherapy, the length of the kidneys decreased to 13.3 (right) and 13.7 cm (left) on ultrasound (Fig 1B). Serum creatinine level decreased to 0.98 mg/dL (87 ?mol/L; eGFR, 83.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 [1.39 mL/s/1.73 m2]). Blood pressure decreased to 140/90 mm Hg on treatment with nifedipine XR, 30 mg, twice a day. One year later, this patient continues to be in remission, with easily controlled hypertension and normal kidney function.  "

3056,S0278-2391(01)37281-6,T-cell lymphoma in the parotid region after cardiac transplant: Case report," Report of case A 29-year-old man received a cardiac transplant in December 1989 because of a viral cardiomyopathy. Postoperatively, there were no complications. To prevent transplant rejection, he was maintained continuously on a regimen of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone. Monitoring involved periodic medical visits for evaluation and myocardial biopsies to detect signs of rejection. In July 1999, the patient developed a left preauricular swelling. Two weeks later, he was admitted to the hospital for renal colic, and basket removal of a urethral stone was accomplished. At that time, the Urology Service consulted the Salivary Gland Center regarding the swelling in the parotid region. Clinically, a swelling measuring approximately 2.5 × 3.0 cm was visible in the region of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland (Fig 1).  Fig. 1  Clinical view of left parotid swelling.    It had appeared suddenly and seemed to be slowly getting larger. It did not fluctuate in size in relation to meals, and only slight discomfort was present. Palpation indicated it was tender, firm, superficial in location, and poorly circumscribed. No swelling in any other salivary glands was observed. The overlying skin was not inflamed, and cervical lymphadenopathy was not present. The oral mucosa was normally moist and not inflamed. The left parotid duct orifice was patent. Milking of the left parotid gland produced a visible salivary return of normal quantity and quality. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated 2 superficial nodular masses intruding into the left parotid gland (Fig 2).  Fig. 2  Computed tomography scan of parotid area. Note the 2 enlarged lymph nodes (arrows) impinging on the superficial surface of the left parotid gland (P). The masseter muscle (M) is located anterior to parotid gland.    These were interpreted as enlarged lymph nodes. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the swelling was performed, and stains for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, and cat scratch disease all proved negative. Although atypical lymphocytes were observed, the FNA biopsy findings were considered inconclusive. The patient was therefore brought to the operating room for an open biopsy. A preauricular skin flap was mobilized, allowing for visualization of the region. The mass was larger than anticipated and was fixed to the parotid gland. An incisional biopsy was performed for diagnostic purposes. The microscopic study showed a population of large atypical cells with large nuclei and prominent single or multiple nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm. Portions of the excised tissue were massively necrotic. A diagnosis of a post-transplant peripheral monoclonal T-cell lymphoma involving the superficial lymph nodes, the parotid gland, and the facial fibroadipose tissue was made (Figs 3, 4).  Fig. 3  Atypical lymphoid cells invading the parotid gland. Note the acini (arrows) and ducts (arrowheads). (Hematoxylin and eosin stain, original magnification ×150.)

B,High-power photomicrograph of periparotid fibrous tissue infiltrated by a population of pleomorphic lymphoma cells and showing numerous reactive macrophages (arrows). (Hematoxylin and eosin stain, original magnification ×375.)    Flow cytometry and immunohistocytochemistry were used to make the final diagnosis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed mature T cells and polyclonal B cells in the sample. Immunohistocytochemical staining showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for leukocyte marker CD45 and T-cell marker CD3. Staining for B-cell markers CD20 and CD79a was negative. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) showed that the neoplastic cells were negative, but small lymphoid-appearing cells dispersed among the neoplastic cells were positive. Testing proved that the patient was EBV seropositive. The patient was referred to the Oncology Service where a thorough search for lymphomatous tissue at other anatomic sites was performed. Chest radiographs revealed no cardiopulmonary disease, and 2 bone marrow aspirates proved to be negative. Because of a complaint of abdominal pain, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was investigated. Multiple incisional biopsies of the GI tract also proved negative. Ultrasound and CT scans of the GI tract, liver, and kidney showed no disseminated lymphomatous pathology. The Oncology Service concluded that the lymphoma was local in its presentation. A decision was made to maintain the immunosuppressive drug therapy, albeit at a lower dose, and initiate a 6-cycle chemotherapeutic protocol with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). Three months later, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the swelling had totally disappeared. "
3061,S0899-7071(02)00543-0,A case of pyothorax-associated lymphoma simulating empyema necessitatis," 2 Case report A 61-year-old man was admitted because of bulging soft tissue located in the right chest wall and with pleuritic chest pain for 4 months. He had a 40-year history of chronic tuberculous empyema and a 15-year history of diabetes mellitus. Four years ago, he was diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis and was treated with antituberculous medicine in our hospital (Fig. 1A and B) . After admission, a high-grade fever developed and he complained of aggravation of the bulging right chest. On review of system, there was general weakness, poor oral intake, fever, headache and a weight loss of 6 kg over the past 2 months. He was febrile with a body temperature of 38.9 °C, and physical examination revealed a right chest wall bulging with erythema and local heating. Breathing sounds were diminished at the right hemithorax with a few crackles. Abnormal lymph nodes were not palpable, and there are no hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed an increased white blood cell count of 15,000/?l and a platelet count of 616,000/?l on a complete blood cell count, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 99 mm/h. His blood glucose level was increased to 228 mg/dl, and the lactate dehydrogenase level was 539 u/l. A chest radiograph obtained at admission revealed bulging soft tissue and rib destruction in the right lower chest wall, which has newly appeared by comparison with a radiograph obtained 4 years ago (Fig. 1C). A chest CT scan was obtained after intravenous contrast injection, and scans revealed a chest wall mass having intrathoracic and extrathoracic components, and showing a large central low attenuation containing air-bubbles and peripheral rim-enhancement at the right hermithorax. Rib destruction with a permeative pattern was noted in the mass, which had medially displaced pleural calcification (Fig. 1D and E). A presumptive diagnosis of empyema necessitatis was made based on the patient's clinical history and laboratory and radiologic findings. Antibiotic treatment failed to control the fever and, subsequently, decortication and extirpation of the chest wall mass were performed with combined partial resection of the ribs. Gross examination revealed that the mass consisted of cheese-like material with old necrotic material in the cavity; the right lung was entrapped by a calcified empyema sac. Pathologic findings of a resected specimen showed the diffused proliferation of large atypical lymphocytes (Fig. 1F). Immunohistological staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for LCA and L26 and negative for UCHL-1 and pan-T, yielding a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffused large cell type, of B-cell lineage.

Subsequent phosphorylation at Y1349/Y1356 near the carboxyl terminus creates a docking site for intracellular adaptor proteins leading to the activation of the downstream signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling cascades. 5  HGF/MET signaling controls MET-dependent cell proliferation, survival and migration that is critical for invasive growth during embryonic development and postnatal organ regeneration, and only fully active in adults for wound healing and tissue regeneration processes. 5  The HGF/MET axis is frequently upregulated through activating mutation, gene amplification, aberrant paracrine, or autocrine ligand production in many cancers, and is strongly linked with tumorigenesis, invasive growth, and metastasis. 5,6  In addition, the activation of HGF/MET signaling is emerging as an important mechanism in resistance to EGFR and B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) inhibitor treatments via MET amplification 7  and/or upregulation of stromal HGF. 8–10  Due to the role of aberrant HGF/MET signaling in human oncogenesis, invasion/metastasis, and resistance, the inhibition of the HGF/MET signaling pathway has great potential in cancer therapy.

3094,S0016-5107(13)00096-5,A case of primary pancreatic Burkitt's lymphoma diagnosed by EUS-guided FNA," Disclosure  All authors disclosed no financial relationships relevant to this publication.   Commentary Sporadic primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the pancreas (PBLP) is an exceptionally rare, high-grade B-cell proliferation representing less than 1% of all pancreatic masses; there are fewer than 20 reported cases in the world literature. Pancreatic lymphoma is usually not at the top of the differential diagnosis when one is confronted with a well-circumscribed pancreatic mass, but there are a few important radiologic clues: robust but isolated peripancreatic lymphadenopathy without metastatic liver disease, diffuse enlargement of the gland (similar to autoimmune pancreatitis), and a normal-appearing pancreatic duct. PBLP displays a characteristically “starry-sky” staining pattern that was probably not the inspiration for van Gogh's similarly named masterpiece; the appearance derives from its exceptional proliferative rate, high-frequency apoptosis, and swarms of macrophages containing ingested apoptotic tumor cells. Although the therapeutic approach to lymphoma differs drastically from that of adenocarcinoma, their presentations can be similar (for example, obstructive jaundice), and PBLP must be differentiated from other lymphomas and solid tumors of the pancreas. EUS-FNA is the diagnostic test of choice, and the very possibility of lymphoma should help quell the ongoing debate about the role of FNA in otherwise seemingly “operable” pancreatic lesions. And although early detection is of the essence, unlike ductal adenocarcinoma, with PBLP it is quite rational to include the phrase “curative intent” in a discussion about prognosis. I'd like to thank the authors for submitting this instructive case. And I'd like to thank Vincent, whose artistic brilliance was overwhelmed by despair and hallucination, for this gem: “When I have a terrible need of—shall I say the word—religion, then I go out and paint the stars.”  David Robbins, MD, MSc   Assistant Editor for Focal Points  "

Primary lymphoma of the bone has been described in patients ranging from 1 to 86 years old, with the peak incidence in the 6th and 7th decade (3). The femur and spine are most frequently involved, accounting for upwards of 25%, while scapular involvement is exceedingly rare, accounting for <1% of all cases (4). The radiographic appearance of primary lymphoma of the bone is variable and should be corroborated on two diagnostic exams, including plain x-ray study, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scintigraphy.

3133,S0147-9563(12)00253-1,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) in an elderly adult due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) presenting as “typhoidal mononucleosis,” mimicking a lymphoma","In adults, EBV as a cause of FUOs is very rare. Although every textbook on FUOs and every chapter on FUOs in major textbooks mention EBV as a cause of FUO in adults, to find cases reported in the literature is difficult. 1-6  Epstein-Barr virus is a rare cause of FUO in adults, but if EBV presents with atypical clinical features that do not suggest EBV, the differential diagnosis in all FUOs is related to the clinical presentation. Straightforward cases with classic or typical presentations usually do not go undiagnosed for long. However, if a presentation is atypical or occurs in an unusual age group for the disorder, then the stage is set for a difficult diagnosis. 8-11  The classic presentation of EBV infectious mononucleosis in a young adult rarely posses diagnostic difficulties. 9,10  However, EBV infectious mononucleosis in the elderly is easily overlooked. In older individuals, EBV infectious mononucleosis presents with fatigue, but usually without pharyngitis or cervical adenopathy. The presentation more closely resembles that of hepatitis or a malignancy. Unless it occurs to the clinician, EBV infectious mononucleosis in the elderly can be a difficult diagnosis, and is particularly challenging if presenting as an FUO. 11,12  Epstein-Barr virus has many potential clinical presentations, ranging from nasopharyngeal carcinoma to Burkett lymphoma to infectious mononucleosis to post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in transplant patients, and in some cases Hodgkin lymphoma. 13-16  Aside from differences in age groups and geographic distributions, the different clinical manifestations of EBV in different settings remain unclear. 8,13  "
3135,S0041-1345(00)01524-4,Successful treatment of Epstein-Barr virus-associated T-Cell cutaneous lymphoma in a renal allograft recipient: case report and review of the literature," Case report A 58-year-old man with end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis had a kidney transplant in 1990. His immediate posttransplant course was complicated by multiple acute renal allograft rejections that were treated with multiple courses of methylprednisolone. No globulins were used. In 1994, he developed pulmonary cryptococcosis that was successfully eradicated with a 1-year treatment with oral fluconazole. Over the next 2 years, his renal function progressively deteriorated. In June 1996, his serum creatinine had risen to 530 ?mol/L. In July 1996, he noticed a painless nodular lesion on the medial aspect of his left upper calf below the knee. He was empirically treated with antimicrobial agents. Over the next 2 weeks, the nodule enlarged rapidly and became tender. The overlying skin became erythematous and started to ulcerate. Clinical examination also revealed numerous satellite nodular lesions extending up the medial aspect of his left thigh. There were also a few painless, rubbery, firm femoral lymphadenopathy. A biopsy was performed. The tissue had morphologic findings of malignant lymphoma that was defined as an immunoblastic lymphoma according to the Working Formulation or a peripheral T-cell lymphoma according to the revised European American lymphoma classification. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the neoplastic cells reacted with antibodies to the pan T-cell markers; CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, and CD45RO. The neoplastic cells were negative for CD8, CD15, CD20, CD30, and MB2. In situ hybridization demonstrated positivity for EBV-encoded RNA and EBV latent membrane protein-1 in the neoplastic cells. Polymerase chain reaction analysis did not demonstrate monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene ?. A final diagnosis of extranodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma with cytotoxic phenotype and latent EBV infection was made. Investigations showed a serum hemoglobin concentration of 8.8 g/dL and serum creatinine of 575 ?mol/L. His liver function tests, serum calcium, and phosphate levels were normal. His chest x-ray showed an old small nodular scar in the right midzone of the lung. Complete staging did not reveal any intraabdominal and intrathoracic lymphadenopathy or brain and bone marrow involvement. The patient was treated with 12 sessions of localised electron beam radiotherapy but declined chemotherapy. His maintenance immunosuppression was withdrawn and he progressed to end-stage renal disease in December 1996. He has remained in clinical remission with no evidence of disease recurrence 3 years after the initial diagnosis. "

Her past medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed pallor and profound splenomegaly. Laboratory values were as follows: hematocrit: 22.0%; white blood cells 3.1×109 l?1 (neutrophils 18%, lymphocytes 73%, monocytes 7%, eosinophils 2%); platelets 125.0×109 l?1; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 60mm per first hour; liver function tests, serum glucose, creatinine, electrolytes, proteins and uric acid: normal; anti-nuclear, -mitochondrial and -DNA antibodies (Abs): negative; herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus Abs: negative; lactate dehydrogenase 334U/l (normal: <250U/l); serum IgG: 11.6g/l, IgA: 2.25g/l, IgM: 2.4g/l; serum electrophoresis: monoclonal IgM ?; direct antiglobulin test: negative. Chest X-ray and CT of the thorax were normal. U/S and CT scans of the abdomen showed profound splenomegaly (25cm), without enlargement of the abdominal lymph nodes. Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy: normal. Examination of PB smear revealed hypochromia and anisopoikilocytosis; the lymphocytes appeared small with well-condensed, coarse chromatin. BM aspiration demonstrated a 30% lymphocytic infiltration, consisting mainly of small lymphocytes; occasional large lymphocytes with prominent nucleoli were also observed. In August 1994, the patient underwent splenectomy; histological and immunohistochemical findings of spleen and liver biopsy specimens are shown in Table 1 . Starting from September 1994, she was given eight courses of CHOP combination chemotherapy; the patient eventually attained complete remission and was off therapy by June 1995. However, in October 1995 the lymphoma relapsed; a second complete remission was attained by six courses of the IVPP protocol (idarubicin (10mg/m2 i.v., days 1–3), etoposide (100mg/m2 i.v., days 1–3) and prednisone (100mg p.o., days 1–7)) [3].

Further investigations were delayed as the patient went overseas. On return to Australia, CT abdomen demonstrated splenomegaly without lymphadenopathy. Clinical differential diagnoses included dengue fever, lymphoproliferative disorder and HLH. Bone marrow aspirate performed for PUO demonstrated a 1% monoclonal B-cell population. CT-PET revealed hypermetabolic spleen, marrow and kidney. Liver biopsy demonstrated sinusoidal atypical lymphocytes and TCR gene re-arrangement was requested. Spleen biopsy was inconclusive showing necrotic tissue. Kidney biopsy showed an interstitial infiltrate of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Within 24 hours of commencing treatment the patient had a right hemicolectomy for massive GI bleed. He died 12 hours post-operatively. Careful examination of the small vessels throughout the resection specimen showed atypical lymphocytes filling their lumina (CD20+, bcl6+, CD10?, CD3?, CD5?, cyclin D1?). No diffuse infiltrate was noted and the lymph nodes appeared reactive. The diagnosis of IVL was established. The review of renal and liver biopsies with CD31 also confirmed IVL. His autopsy showed similar infiltrates."

3177,S0960-9776(11)00157-3,Breast implant related Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma presenting as late onset peri-implant effusion," Case report A 33-year-old lady was presented in October 2009 with a three-week history of gradual, painless swelling of the right breast. She had undergone bilateral breast augmentation seven years previously with insertion of Polyurethane covered cohesive gel filled implants (Silimed). There were no recorded post-operative problems and her subsequent course was unremarkable. There was no history of trauma to the breast. Clinical examination confirmed diffuse swelling of the right breast. There was no skin dimpling, peau d’orange or nipple retraction. There was no erythema and the breast was not painful or warm to touch. Ultrasound examination revealed a large fluid collection surrounding the implant. The fluid tracked around the deep aspect and completely encased the implant. No collapse of the implant or breech in the capsule was seen. Bilateral mammography revealed a unilateral (right) effusion. No parenchymal abnormality was noted. Breast Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed intact implants. The fluid was noted to lie between the primary silicone implant and the pseudo capsule. A total of 600 mL of clear yellow fluid was aspirated and submitted for microbiology, biochemistry and cytology. The fluid was an exudate — protein content of 50 g/L, with no growth for infective organisms Cytological examination revealed a cellular aspirate with a population of large, pleomorphic discohesive cells. These cells had irregular, lobulated nuclei with multiple variable nucleoli. A cell block preparation confirmed the large pleomorphic cells (Fig. 1 ). The large cells were confirmed as a monoclonal population of T cells ? CD4 positive, CD22, CD23 and CD11C — weak positive. Given the clinical and cytological suspicion of an ALK1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma, CD30, CD43 and ALK1 and T cell gene rearrangement analysis were added. The results supported the diagnosis of an ALK1neg ALCL (Figs. 2 and 3  ). The patient was referred to the Haematology Department for treatment and received six cycles of CHOP-14. After completion of chemotherapy both implants were removed and the implant capsule was examined for residual malignancy. Histological assessment, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry confirmed an inflammatory reactive process with no evidence of tissue involvement by lymphoma. The patient remains well one year after treatment (Last follow-up visit on 23 November 2010). "
3189,S2173-5735(12)00123-8,Laryngeal Manifestation of B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma," Case Report A 39-year-old male consulted due to persistent dysphonia and mild odynodysphagia lasting several months, with the loss of approximately 5 kilos in weight, without haemoptysis, dyspnoea, fever or night sweats. His personal history revealed that he smoked 35packs/year and was a moderate drinker, with no known allergies or metabolopathies; his tonsils were removed in infancy. A fibrolaryngoscopic examination was performed (Fig. 1A) and revealed a smooth, unulcered, left lateral supraglottal growth under the mucosa, affecting the lingual face of the epiglottis, and the ipsilateral arytenoepiglottal band and fold, with good mobility of the vocal cords. He had no palpable laterocervical adenopathies. A CT scan (Fig. 1B) revealed a homogeneous supraglottal mass with the same density as the muscle occupying the left part of the laryngeal vestibule with evident involvement of the left pre-epiglottal space. Extension into the left pyriform recess was also observed without evidence of involvement at the level of the glottis. At chest level, a small peripheral opacity was noted as poorly defined on the upper right lobule of the lung and another larger one with attenuation in a triangular shape at the base of the pleura in the lower right lobule, adjacent to the cisura major, all non-specific findings. The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed concentric thickening of a segment of the colon suggesting lymphomatous infiltration, without occlusion of its lumen, causing an aneurysmatic dilatation. Based on a suspected diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma, it was decided to carry out surgery to perform a direct laryngoscopy with removal of a biopsy and endolaryngeal resection of the supraglottal growth using CO2 laser, following confirmation of carcinomatous tissue in the intra-operative biopsy. However, the biopsy report showed it to be a malignant small-cell tumour and so resection was suspended to enable a better a posteriori study. The pathology report (Fig. 2A) revealed an infiltration by small-cell lymphocytic NHL, immunophenotype B, CD 20 positive, CD 3 negative, CD 79 A positive and Ki 67 positive. It was immunohistochemically positive for CD 45 ALC and cytokeratin 18. In the extension study, normal haemogram and proteinogram results were obtained, with ANA, HIV, EBV, CMV and HBV serologies all negative. No malignancy was seen in the biopsy of the bone marrow. After confirmation of the diagnosis of a stage IV E non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by the Head and Neck Oncology Committee, it was decided to apply sequential radiochemotherapy. Seven cycles of chemotherapy (CHOP-R) were administered with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristin, prednisone and rituximab every 21 days followed by a PET-CT scan to assess response to the chemotherapy with the continued presence of marker uptake in the left supraglottal region (SUVmax 3.4g/mL) and bilateral hiliar adenopathies (SUVmax 3.5g/mL), meeting the criteria for partial response, so cervical-mediastinic radiation therapy was continued for a total of 53.2Gy in fractions of 180cGy/fraction/day over one month. Thirty months after diagnosis, the patient remains asymptomatic and with a complete response to treatment, as confirmed clinically and radiologically (Fig. 2B). "
3193,S1092-9134(11)00025-6,Plasmablastic lymphoma clinically presenting in the urinary tract," 2 Case presentation  2.1 Case 1 A 78-year-old HIV+ man treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (CD4 count, 260 cells per cubic millimeter) presented with acute renal failure. The patient had no other significant medical history and, in particular, no history of lymphoma or myeloma. A computer tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a multifocal bladder tumor with bilateral hydronephrosis (Fig. 1 ). Right and left ureteral stents were inserted. Whole body positron emission tomography (PET)–CT revealed hypermetabolic iliac and mesenteric lymph nodes. Cystoscopy showed a cerebriform exophytic mass of the bladder wall, and a transurethral resection was performed. Histologically, under a normal urothelium, the bladder wall was infiltrated by a diffuse proliferation of monotonous large lymphoid cells with plasmablastic features but without classic plasmacytic morphology (Fig. 2A , B). Apoptotic bodies, tingible body macrophages, numerous mitotic figures, and areas of necrosis were present. No infiltration of the bone marrow was identified on biopsy and flow cytometry.   2.2 Case 2 A 71-year-old man was hospitalized with an acute left abdominal pain. He was HIV? but had a previous history of colic adenocarcinoma treated in 1990 without recurrence. Ultrasound showed a left paraureteral 2.5-cm mass with homolateral hydronephrosis. A ureteral stent was inserted; and biopsy findings were similar to those described in case 1, with fewer apoptotic bodies and no tingible body macrophages. Whole-body PET-CT revealed a unique retroperitoneal hypermetabolic mass compressing the left ureter. No bone marrow infiltration was present on biopsy or flow cytometry, and no serum paraprotein could be detected. The immunohistochemical profile of both tumors was similar and suggested a PBL (Table 1 ). The atypical cells were positive for the plasma cell markers CD138, CD38, and MUM1 (Fig. 3A  and B); showed ? light-chain restriction; and had a high proliferation index (90% Ki67+). Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Fig. 2C); the pan-leucocyte marker CD45; B-cell markers such as CD20 (Fig. 3C and D), CD79a, and PAX5; and T-cell markers such as CD3 and CD5 were all negative. CD56 was positive only in case 1. Epstein-Barr virus in situ hybridization (EBV-encoded RNA [EBER]) was positive in case 1 (Fig. 3E) and negative in case 2 (Fig. 3F). ALK-1, HHV8, and CD30 were negative in both cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed to characterize chromosomal lesions described in PBLs and myelomas (deletion of p53, Bcl-1, IgH, and MYC translocations). Neither case revealed translocations involving Bcl-1 or deletion of TP53. The first case harbored a translocation juxtaposing IgH and MYC (t8;14) (Fig. 3G); however, the second case did not (Fig. 3H). For the first case, considering the patient's (age, Karnofsky index 80%, weight 44 kg, CD4 count) and lymphoma's (CD20 negative) characteristics, a cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone regimen was chosen, whereas antiretroviral therapy was continued. A rapid clinical improvement was achieved. Ureteral stents were removed after 3 cycles, and a complete remission was obtained after 6 cycles with no evidence of recidivism at 1.5 years (January 2011). For the second case, a complete workup did not reveal abnormalities other than a rapid increase in the size of the primary lesion. A good partial response was obtained after 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone regimen. This improvement was transient, and irradiation (25 × 2 Gy) was delivered on the primary tumor that remained solitary. Unfortunately, a rapid dissemination was observed with lymph nodes and liver involvement; and the patient died 7 months after the diagnosis.  "
3220,S2214-2509(18)30119-7,Occam’s razor need not apply: Advanced HIV infection presenting with five simultaneous opportunistic infections and central nervous system lymphoma," Case description A 56-year-old man was found by his spouse unresponsive and demonstrating generalized tonic-clonic movements with bowel and bladder incontinence. Emergency medical services were called and he was intubated for airway protection. Preceding this event, the patient had reported upper respiratory illness symptoms for several weeks with intermittent fevers, as well as altered mental status described as slowed cognition and unusual affect. He took no medications prior to admission, though did have a history of chronic HBV and HIV acquired in the 1980s, thought to be from MSM exposure. He had previously taken HIV and HBV medications for nearly 20 years, but had discontinued all medical therapy three years prior to admission due to side effects. His CD4 T-cell count at the time of discontinuation was 250 cells/?L. On admission the patient’s temperature was 38?°C, heart rate was 127 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 122/83?mmHg, and blood oxygen saturation was 100% on FiO2 30%. He was cachectic on examination. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Notable initial laboratory values included a serum sodium of 114 mEq/L, lactic acid of 7.5?mmol/L, creatinine kinase of 1292 U/L, hemoglobin of 12.0 gm/dl, white blood cell count of 5.8?K/?L, and platelets of 143?K/?L. Absolute CD4 T-cell count was 19 cells/uL and HIV viral load was 468,999 copies/mL. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed a right basal ganglia edematous area measuring 20?×?24?mm, with mild mass effect. A brain magnetic resonance imaging study with gadolinium showed a rim-enhancing lesion involving the right caudate and basal ganglia with mass effect indenting the right lateral ventricle (Fig. 1 ). Lumbar puncture revealed atypical lymphocytes with cytopathology consistent with B-cell lymphoma. The patient’s respiratory status improved and he was liberated from mechanical ventilation the day following admission, though remained somnolent afterwards. Further work-up revealed positive hepatitis B surface antigen with HBV viral load 8.23 log IU/mL, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) growth in blood cultures, positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cerebrospinal fluid, and serum cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load of 2770 IU/mL with findings on funduscopic exam of creamy exudates with associated dot-blot hemorrhages, consistent with CMV retinitis. Video electroencephalogram monitoring did not record further seizure activity. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed strong fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity primarily within the CNS lesion, consistent with HIV-associated primary CNS B-cell lymphoma (Fig. 2 ). Diffuse, though weak, FDG avidity was also noted in the lungs which prompted a subsequent bronchoalveolar lavage, which demonstrated Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) via PCR. Thus, this patient’s presentation was ultimately consistent with advanced HIV infection with CD4 count of 19 cells/uL, chronic HBV, HIV and EBV-associated primary CNS B-cell lymphoma, PJP, CMV retinitis, and MAC bloodstream infection. Initially, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was started for treatment of PJP and was transitioned to atovaquone due to concern for interaction with methotrexate (planned therapy for primary B-cell lymphoma), unknown glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) status, and minimal hypoxia post-extubation. However, methotrexate was later deferred due to the patient's multiple comorbidities. CMV retinitis was initially treated with intravenous ganciclovir, though with developing marrow suppression he was transitioned to intravitreal ganciclovir injection. Anti-retroviral therapy and anti-HBV medications were initiated after seven days of CMV therapy, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, dolutegravir, and rilpivirine, based on prior genotype data. Clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin were recommended for MAC bloodstream infection. Dexamethasone was started for cerebral edema, after detection of primary CNS lymphoma. The patient had ongoing encephalopathy that required the patient’s family to provide direction regarding goals of care. By hospital day 36, the patient’s encephalopathy had not significantly improved and the family requested that most anti-infective medications, including ART, be stopped, as this was felt to be what the patient would have wanted. At the request of the patient’s spouse he was discharged home with palliative care, and passed away at home several weeks later. "
3229,S0898-6568(12)00308-7,Identification of a novel crosstalk between casein kinase 2? and NPM-ALK in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Cell lines and tissue culture The characteristics of the three ALK+ALCL cell lines, Karpas 299, SU-DHL-1 and SUPM2, have been previously described [30]. All three cell lines are negative for the Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen. They were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 and maintained in RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The culture media contain 2mM l-glutamine and was enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). Ficoll-Paque (GE Health care, Quebec, Canada) was used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors. Following PBMC isolation, T-cells were purified using a commercial available kit (Stem Cell Technologies, BC, Canada).   2.2 Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed using Cell Lytic Buffer M (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 0.1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), a protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Inc., San Diego, CA), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany). After incubating the lysate on ice for 30min, it was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15min. Two micrograms of the primary antibody was added to 500?g of protein lysate and rotated overnight at 4°C. Negative control samples with the primary antibody omitted were included. 50?l of protein (A/G Plus-agarose) beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to both the test and control lysates and rocked for 2h at 4°C. The beads were then washed 4 times with cold PBS. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the final wash was done using cold cell lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the final wash was done using RIPA buffer. Proteins were then eluted from the beads in 20?l of SDS protein loading buffer by boiling for 5min at 100°C. The complex was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Preparation of cell lysates for Western blots was done as previously described [31]. Antibodies employed in this study included those reactive with CK2?, ALK, phosphor-tyrosine and ?-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), ?-catenin (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and phosphor-serine (Chemicon, Temecula, CA).   2.3 Short interfering RNA (siRNA) siRNAs for CK2 ?/?? and ALK were purchased from (Sigma-Aldrich). Scrambled siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of siRNA was carried out using an electrosquare electroporator, BTX ECM 800 (225V, 8.5ms, 3 pulses) (Holliston, MA, USA). The concentration of siRNA used was 200pM/1×106 cells, and cells were harvested at 48h after transfection. Protein levels for either CK2 ?/?? and ALK were assessed by Western blot analysis to evaluate the efficiency of inhibition.   2.4 Pharmacologic inhibitors of CK2 and measurement of cell viability 4,5,6,7-Tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB), a pharmacologic inhibitor for CK2 was purchased from Calbiochem. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A total of 50,000cells/mL of culture medium were plated in triplicate and trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich) exclusion assay was performed every 24h for up to 3days following transfection of CK2 ?/?? or scrambled siRNA. In case of TBB or DMSO a total of 100,000cells/mL of culture medium were plated and cell count was done after 48h of adding the drug at different concentrations. All experiments were performed in triplicates.   2.5 Gene expression array analysis of the Wnt pathway We used the reverse transcription (RT2) Profiler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Array Human Wnt Signalling Pathway array purchased from SuperArray (Bioscience Frederick, MD). The complete gene list is available on http://www.superarray.com. Total RNA from an ALK+ALCL cell line, Karpas 299, treated with either scrambled siRNA or siRNA against ALK, were isolated using the TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and measured using the DU1640 Beckman spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, ON). First strand cDNA synthesis reaction was performed as follows: 2?g of extracted RNA was mixed with 10?L of the SuperArray RT cocktail mix. The products were then incubated at 37°C for 1h and heated at 95°C for 5min. Real-time-based SYBR green PCR was performed using an ABI 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, ON) and the following thermal cycling condition was used: 95°C for 10min, followed by 40cycles of 95°C for 15s and 60°C for 60s. Data analysis and the cycle threshold (CT) values, which were defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes an arbitrarily set threshold, were analyzed using the SDS (version 2.2.2) program (Applied Biosystems). The CT value of each gene was normalized to that of GAPDH, which is included in this commercially available kit.   2.6 ?-Catenin transcriptional activity assessed by TOPFlash/FOPFlash To assess the transcriptional activity of ?-catenin, we employed the TOPFlash/FOPFlash luciferase system. Karpas 299 was treated for 24h with either 50?M TBB or DMSO then it was transfected with responsive firefly luciferase reporter plasmids, TOPFlash (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or the negative control, FOPFlash (Millipore). After 24h of transfection, cells were harvested and cell extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). The firefly luciferase activity and renilla luciferase activity were assessed using the dual luciferase reagent (Promega). Data are reported as means±standard deviations of three independent experiments, each of which was performed in triplicates.   2.7 Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean+/?standard derivation. Unless stated otherwise, statistical significance was determined using two-tailed Student's t-test and statistical significance was achieved when the p value is <0.05.  "
3231,S0145-2126(01)00198-9,Cutaneous lymphoblastic lymphoma of putative plasmacytoid dendritic cell-precursor origin: two cases," 2 Case 1 A 69-year-old Japanese male was admitted to our hospital with a reddish skin tumor on his back in January 2000 (Fig. 1  and Table 1 ). The tumor size was 8 cm×5.5 cm, and no other abnormal lymph node swelling or tumors were noted on computed tomography. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the following analyses to be performed. Bone marrow aspirate showed no abnormal cells. The histology of the tumor showed TdT-positive LBL (Fig. 1), and the small to medium-sized lymphoblasts with scarce cytoplasm and clearly visible nucleoli were (CD45, CD43, CD74 and bcl2)-positive, and (CD1a, CD30 (Ki-1), CD45RO (UCHL1), CD56 (Leu19), CD57 (Leu7), S100, perforin and fascin)-negative (Table 2 ). A laboratory examination showed normal blood counts, no liver or renal dysfunction, no coagulation abnormality, and normal serum level of sIL-2R. The patient was treated for a diagnosis of LBL, clinical stage IAE, using 50Gy of local radiotherapy, and subsequently the skin tumor disappeared. In March 2000, a bone marrow aspirate was performed for evaluating the disease after radiotherapy, and it showed 35% of infiltrating abnormal lymphoblasts with immature plasmacytoid cell feature (Fig. 1). The sample was analyzed using flow cytometry, and the pathological cells were T cell markers (CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD8, TCR?/?, TCR?/?)-negative, B cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD24)-negative, NK cell markers (CD16, CD56, CD57, NKp46, NKp44)-negative, hematopoietic progenitor markers (CD34, CD117, AC133)-negative, and myeloid/other markers (CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD25, CD27, CD33, CD38, CD40, CD41, CD70, CD122, CD154, GPA, FMC7, 97A6)-negative (Table 2). Approximately 76–99% of the gated pathological cells were (CD4, CD10, CD36, CD45, CD54 and HLA-DR)-positive (Fig. 2 ). Cytoplasmic expression of myeloperoxidase, CD3? and CD22 were negative for the cells. Chromosome analysis of the bone marrow specimen showed complex abnormal karyotype: 46, XY, add(5)(q11), add(5)(q31), t(6;8)(p21;q24), del(13)(q12q14), add(15)(q13) in (9/20) metaphases studied according to ISCN (Fig. 3 ). Southern blot analysis of the sample showed no rearranged bands for Ig-JH, TCR-C?, J?, J?1, and c-myc (Fig. 4 ). No EBV-derived DNA was detected. The patient was treated using intensive chemotherapy of THP-COP regimen (pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone). The bone marrow aspirate after the first course of THP-COP showed no pathological cells, and he received five more courses of THP-COP at 3-week intervals. In September 2000, the patient was diagnosed with leukemic transformation from the disease; the leukocyte count was 49.0×109 cells/l (lymphoblasts 71%), and the serum level of lactate dehydrogenase was 23,040IU/l. Since, it was suggested that the phenotype of the lymphoblasts had been very similar to lymphoid DC-precursors, so called “plasmacytoid cells”, we further examined the expression of DC markers by flow cytometry (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The lymphoblasts were (CD1a, CD80, CD83)-negative, (CD54, CD58)-dim-positive, and CD86-bright-positive. A weekly DVP regimen (daunomycin, vincristine and prednisolone) was started but the disease was resistant to DVP, and the patient died of septic shock in November 2000. "
3244,S0002-9378(12)00591-1,Burkitt's lymphoma presenting as ovarian torsion," Case Report A 33 year old woman with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) presented to the emergency room for evaluation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain. She reported several weeks of chronic abdominal pain and bloating with severe episodic pain over the prior 3 days. She reported nausea and vomiting with the episodes of pain but denied other complaints including fevers, chills, dysuria, constipation, diarrhea, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Her medical history was notable for HIV diagnosed 10 years earlier and well controlled with highly active antiretroviral therapy (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir). Her recent viral load was undetectable and the CD4 count was greater than 250. Transvaginal ultrasound performed in the emergency room demonstrated bilateral edematous ovaries, the left measuring 8.9 × 7.9 × 5.7 cm, and the right ovary measuring 9.7 × 8.6 × 5.7 cm (Figures 1 and 2)  with normal arterial flow bilaterally noted on Doppler studies. A computed tomography scan also revealed nonspecific thickening of the cecum, appendiceal inflammation, and enlarged right pelvic lymph nodes (Figure 3) with the remaining pelvic organs and retroperitoneal lymph nodes appearing unremarkable. She was suspected to have ovarian torsion and underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Upon entry into the abdomen, the bilateral enlarged ovaries were found to be twisted on their pedicles numerous times. The ovarian tissue was friable and gelatinous and appeared to be nonviable (Figure 4). Bilateral oophorectomy was performed. Further exploration of the abdomen revealed a solid mass involving the appendix, cecum, and mesentery and densely adherent to the right side wall, which was unable to be safely removed. Pathologic examination of both ovaries was consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma. Histologic staining was positive for CD-20 and ki-67 (Figures 5 and 6).  A postoperative work-up revealed no other evidence of metastatic disease. The patient received 6 cycles of rituximab, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography at 6 months showed a significant decrease in the tumor burden. "
3254,S0002-9394(12)00072-4,"Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma of the Orbit: Clinicopathologic, Immunohistochemical, and Prognostic Features of 20 Cases","Despite being the third most common primary ocular adnexal lymphoma, primary orbital DLBCL is nonetheless relatively rare in the orbit (8% of ocular adnexal lymphomas) when compared to extranodal marginal zone and follicular lymphomas (about 50% and 25%, respectively). 10–14  It should be noted, however, that in 15 cases of lymphoma of the lacrimal sac, 10 displayed features of DLBCL. 15  DLBCL is more common when considered as a secondary manifestation of an already systematized lymphoma. 16  Consequently, reports that focus on this disease within the orbit and that provide both reliable clinical and immunopathologic data are sparse. It was first discovered in 1989 that orbital DLBCL, even with bone destruction, was compatible with a 2.5-year survival rate of 56%. 12,17  The authenticity of this finding was supported by several studies of many different ocular adnexal lymphomas that included small numbers of DLBCLs, which similarly indicated a prognosis that seemed more favorable than expected given the worrisome cytology of the lesions. 18–24  "
3257,S0899-7071(01)00322-9,Mastopathy-mimicking ultrasonographic appearance in a case with Burkitt's lymphoma," 2 Case report A 48-year-old Japanese woman was seen at Tokai University Hospital complaining of pain in the mandible. At physical examination, egg-sized, hard, movable masses were detected in both breasts and which were not associated with skin changes. The nipples were normal. Laboratory examination revealed a marked elevation in the level of lactate dehydrogenase (4263 IU/dl), and hyperuricemic renal failure, findings, which suggested the presence of an impending tumor lysis syndrome. Peripheral blood examination showed lymphomatous cells in 1% of white blood cells differentials, and a bone marrow aspiration revealed an extensive infiltration by cells of the Burkitt's type of lymphoma (Fig. 1) . US of the breasts demonstrated that the normal breast tissues had been replaced by a diffusely mixed or mottled pattern of echo texture, associated by hypoechoic cyst-like masses with minimal internal echogenicity, findings, which could not be differentiated from a mastopathy. A posterior enhancement was also observed (Fig. 2) . The masses had a smooth border, were movable on palpation and did not involve the muscular elements or the subcutaneous tissues. The diagnosis was of Burkitt's lymphoma with involvement of the bone marrow and the patient was treated with a combination of chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone. At the end of the first course of chemotherapy, an US of the breasts revealed that the mottled echotextures and hypoechoic cyst-like masses had disappeared (Fig. 3) . "
3261,S0165-4608(10)00481-4,Translocation (3;8)(q27;q24) in two cases of triple hit lymphoma," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case 1 A 72-year-old man diagnosed with diabetes mellitus was seen in the emergency department because of back pain and signs consistent with compression of the cauda equina during the last 3 months. Physical examination showed that the patient was unable to complete abduction of the upper left extremity. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin values of 65 g/L, white blood cell count of 0.5×109/L, platelets 113×109/L, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1,077 U/L, bilirrubin 1.12 mg/dL, and ?2-microglobulin 1.5 mg/L. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest and the abdomen showed several hyperdense liver lesions and coexisting lytic and blastic bone lesions at L1, L5, and the sacrum. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a cuff that surrounded L1, L5-S1, penetrating into the medullar canal. A left-arm x-ray showed a humeral fracture at shoulder level. The International Prognostic Index [3] (IPI) score was 5. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy showed partial marrow infiltration by atypical lymphoid cells. No cells were observed in two cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Liver biopsy revealed massive infiltration by atypical B lymphocytes morphologically similar to BL. The immunohistochemistry study showed positivity for CD20, CD10, and bcl6, whereas bcl2 was negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed MYC rearrangement, but not with IGH. The proliferative index, assessed by Ki-67, was nearly 100%. Diagnosis of lymphoma with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL in Ann Arbor stage IV was performed, and chemotherapy with the PETHEMA (Programa Español de Tratamiento en Hematología) protocol for BL patients older than 55 years [4] was started. After achieving a complete remission that lasted for 9 months, the patient presented central nervous system affection by lymphoma, as judged by MRI. Biopsy of the lesion was not done. The patient is currently alive and receiving palliative radiotherapy.   2.2 Case 2 A 44-year-old woman was referred to another center due to the appearance of enlarged lymph nodes and pleural effusion. Serum LDH was 957 IU/L. CT of the chest and abdomen revealed multiple lymph nodes in the axillary, infraclavicular, and mediastinal areas, a retrocardiac mass of 53×23 mm, large splenomegaly, and a bulky retroperitoneal mass embedding large vessels and compressing the inferior cava vein. Diagnosis of DLBCL was made by biopsy of a peripheral lymph node. The patient was treated with six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with partial response. Three cycles of R-ESHAP (rituximab, etoposide, cytarabine, cisplatinum, and methylprednisolone) were subsequently administered, resulting in complete response. Two and a half months later, mediastinal and abdominal lesions reappeared, as did a large pelvic mass. LDH level was 2,492 IU/L, ?2-microglobulin 4.6 U/L, leukocyte count 1.4×109/L, platelets 107×109/L, and hemoglobin 100 g/L. The patient was transferred to our hospital for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but upon admission, a large abdominal mass was evident. A CT scan showed a rounded mass of 22 cm in diameter. Bone marrow aspirate showed massive infiltration by immature and vacuolated lymphoid cells, suggesting the diagnosis of UL. Re-examination of the initial lymph node biopsy showed diffuse infiltration by cells with intermediate characteristics between Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large-cell lymphoma, expressing pan B cell markers, CD10, bcl2, and bcl6. Ki-67 was 95%. The final diagnosis was UL. The IPI score was 3. The patient received the first block of the PETHEMA protocol for BL in patients younger than 55 years but died 2 months later due to disease progression.   2.3 Design and methods   Cytogenetic studies: karyotype was analysed by G-banded chromosomes obtained from 24-hours BM cultures and described according to ISCN 2009.   FISH: The LSI IGH/BCL2 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe set, LSI IGH/MYC, CEP 8 Tri-color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe set, and LSI BCL6 Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (all from Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) were performed on previously G-banded chromosome preparations and/or methanol-acetic acid fixed cells from BM according to the manufacturer’s instructions.   Immunophenotyping:  BM cells anticoagulated with EDTA were stained with a wide panel of fluorochrome-combined antibodies, including CD5PE, CD10FITC, CD23PE, CD19PerCP and PE, CD20FITC, CD79bPE, and CD38PerCP (Immunotech, Barcelona, Spain) in four color combinations. Surface light immunoglobulin chains were detected using a mixture of polyclonal anti-kappa, anti-lambda, and monoclonal anti CD19 antibodies (DAKO, Barcelona, Spain). The cells were analyzed with an Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Coulter, Hyaleah, FL). At least 20,000 cells were acquired for each tube. The results were analyzed with Expo-32 software.   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis:  DNA was extracted from BM cells using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. PCR analysis was performed to evaluate the presence of a t(14;18) involving the joining region of the IGH and distinct regions of the BCL2 gene (using primers to the major breakpoint region (MBR), the 3’ major breakpoint region (3’MBR), and the minor cluster region (MCR) of the BCL2 gene. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel.  "
3264,S0190-9622(98)70571-7,Cutaneous presentation of nasal lymphoma: A report of two cases," CASE REPORTS  Case 1 A 68-year-old man had a 6-month history of hoarseness and painful erythematous swelling of the nose. Three months previously, results of bronchoscopy showed left vocal cord paresis, and a biopsy specimen of the nasal mucosa demonstrated inflamed granulation tissue with no evidence of malignancy. A diagnosis of rosacea and idiopathic vocal cord paresis was made, and oral tetraycline was administered without clinical improvement. Examination revealed symmetric erythematous nasal swelling with induration that involved the nasal bridge and nasomalar junction (Fig. 1, A).   Fig. 1   A, Symmetric nasal swelling and crusted plaque on nasal bridge. B, Infiltrate of large pleomorphic lymphocytes throughout the dermis. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification ×200.)    Crusted plaques on the nasal bridge, pustules on the malar area, and marked periorbital edema were evident. Dilated pilosebaceous orifices gave the nose a peau d’orange appearance. No lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was present. Two cutaneous biopsy specimens revealed a prominent superficial and deep lymphoid infiltrate without obvious atypia, angiotropism, or epidermotropism. A nasal mucosa biopsy specimen, including cartilage, revealed a diffuse lymphoid infiltrate similar to that in the skin. However, in the deep nasal submucosa and surrounding the nasal cartilage a dense infiltrate of large malignant cells with complex nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and numerous mitoses were found (Fig. 1, B ). Results of immunophenotyping of the specimen showed all cells to be CD45 (LCA) positive. All large cells were CD30 (Ki-1), CD3, and UCHL1 positive and L26, LeuM1 negative, confirming the diagnosis of CD 30–positive large cell lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate studies showed no evidence of lymphoma. A normal computerized tomography of the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen confirmed cutaneous localization of the lymphoma. No evidence of lymphomatous involvement of the vocal cord was found. A regimen of bleomycin, adrimycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, and decadron was administered in six cycles during a 6-month period. The tumor regressed completely, and 2 years after completion of chemotherapy, the patient remains in remission. His hoarseness has persisted.   Case 2 A 68-year-old man had a 12-year history of a cold blue nose with crusting, ulceration, erosion, and scarring of alae nasi. Examination revealed atrophy and scarring of the left alae nasi with loss of cartilage and crusting of the overlying skin (Fig. 2, A).   Fig. 2   A, Notching of alae nasi, with overlying crusting and scarring. B, Large atypical cells surrounding and infiltrating a blood vessel. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification × 200.)    The nasal mucosa appeared normal. Biopsy specimens revealed a moderately dense lymphocytic infiltrate around upper dermal vessels without significant atypia or epidermotropism. Special stains were negative for fungi and bacteria, including acid-fast bacilli. The results of hematologic, biochemical, and immunologic studies of the nasal bones were normal as were x-ray findings. A wedge biopsy specimen of nasal mucosa, cartilage, and skin revealed a dense infiltrate of large atypical cells in the deep soft tissue, primarily around blood vessels with focal invasion of the blood vessels (Fig. 2, B ). Immunoperoxidase staining on paraffin sections was positive for CD3, confirming the infiltrate to be predominantly T cell. The final diagnosis was angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow studies and CT scan examination of head, neck, and thorax were normal. The patient received six cycles of chlorambucil, 10 mg, for 10 days each month. The erythema and crusting resolved, and the patient remains well without further progression of the nasal lesions 1 year later.  "

The delay between initial presentation and diagnosis of lymphoma varied from 1 month to 10 years (mean 28 months). The diagnosis of T-cell NHL was made on lymph node biopsy (seven cases), bone marrow biopsy (one case), liver biopsy (one case), splenectomy (one case), and parotidectomy (one case). As for the classification of lymphoid neoplasms [1], the T-cell NHL were peripheral lymphomas of unspecified type (eight cases with one ?? T-cell lymphoma) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell NHL (three cases). Prognosis evaluation for the 11 cases was as follows: performance status 0 (four cases), 1 (one case), and 2 (six cases). Five patients were over 60 years of age. At the time of diagnosis, inclusion in the Ann Arbor classification was as follows: stage II (one case), stage III (six cases) and stage IV (four cases; three bone marrow and one liver involvement). The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was high in six patients. All patients were HIV 1-2 antibody-negative. All patients initially received polychemotherapy Cyclophosphamide-Doxorubicin-Vincristine-Prednisolone (CHOP) lymphoma protocol), which was associated with radiotherapy for two of them. Only three patients were responders with two complete (patients 2 and 6) and one partial remission (patient 8). Patient 2 presented a meningeal relapse after 5 years of complete remission. All of the other patients died from disease progression. Table 1  shows presentations and delays preceding the diagnosis of T-cell NHL. "
3351,S0165-5876(12)00103-6,Acute bilateral blindness as a presenting symptom of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma," 2 Patient presentation A 4-year-old boy presented to the emergency room (ER) with a history of vision loss in both eyes starting 2 days prior. He had no pain and denied any other symptom. His problem was discovered by the parents as the child was having difficulty to walk independently secondary to loss of vision. Physical examination in the ER revealed normal neurologic evaluation and no abnormality except for bilateral visual loss. Fundoscopy was normal and pupils were fixed at 5mm in diameter. A head computed tomography scan was performed and demonstrated a solid lytic mass at the skull base, centered on the body of the sphenoid and posterior ethmoid bones, extending intracranially along the planum sphenoidale as well as bulging laterally within the posterior orbital cavities toward the orbital apices. The intra-orbital extraconal component caused bilateral optic nerve compression that was more evident on the left side. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study with and without contrast showed no sign of optic nerve involvement (Fig. 1 ). The patient underwent immediate endoscopic transnasal optic nerve decompression surgery and biopsy that night. Histopathology revealed lymphoma and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma. Malignant cells were not found in cerebrospinal fluid. No bone marrow involvement was detected. Chest and abdomen CT scan were negative for malignant tumors. Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus test result were negative. On the second post operative day patient had partial vision improvement and could perceive light with right eye and was able to count fingers from 50cm with left.The patient was also treated with steroids and a chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate. This was followed by a second course of doxorubicin, rituximab and intrathecal cytarabine and methotrexate.After 4 months of treatment the patient was able to count fingers from one meter with both eyes.

3358,S0046-8177(11)00084-0,Anaplastic lymphoma kinase–positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as retroperitoneal fibrosis," 2 Case report A 29-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of early satiety, abdominal discomfort, constipation, and progressive fatigue. She underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy and was found to have grade I varices on upper endoscopy with an unremarkable colonoscopy. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen demonstrated peripancreatic edema with a possible pancreatic head mass and portal vein thrombus (Fig. 1 ). An exploratory laparotomy revealed no definitive mass, and the biopsy demonstrated fibroadipose tissue with inflammation and fat necrosis. A bone marrow biopsy and a liver biopsy were unremarkable. Molecular studies for BCR-ABL and JAK2 (V617F) performed on the peripheral blood were negative. She was discharged from the hospital after experiencing minimal improvement. Over the ensuing 6-month period, she continued to experience unexplained abdominal pain and progressive jaundice. During her final presentation, she had failure to thrive, worsening abdominal pain, and lower extremity claudication. Her clinical symptoms were believed to be consistent with sclerosing mesenteritis or RF. An IgG4 subclass was found to be normal, and she failed to respond to steroid therapy. She acutely decompensated, developing bacteremia and multisystem organ failure. Surgery deferred further biopsy secondary to her poor condition, and the patient died. At autopsy, diffuse fibrosis surrounded the abdominal aorta from the level of the renal arteries to the origin of the iliac vessels. The fibrosis also encased the abdominal and thoracic organs, bilateral ureters, and the inferior mesenteric artery. There was loss of colonic mucosal folding pattern in the distribution of the inferior mesenteric artery. Yellow plaquelike deposits were found in the liver, lungs, and pericardium and also involved abdominal soft tissue and adrenal glands. Extensive pelvic adhesions between the rectum, uterus, and bladder were noted. A large thrombus occluded the portal vein. Histologic examination showed marked periaortic fibrosis and yellow plaquelike deposits, which were infiltrated by aggregates of large discohesive tumor cells (Fig. 2A). Many of the cells demonstrated wreath-shaped nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Tumor cells were found in the pericardial and pleural serosal surfaces and also formed a thrombus that occluded the portal vein. There were no spindle-shaped cells or a dense plasma cell infiltrate. Tumor cells infiltrated the lung parenchyma as well as the muscularis mucosa of the small and large intestine. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the cells to be negative for S-100, pan-cytokeratin, and hematopoietic markers including those of B-cell lineage (CD20) and T-cell lineage (CD2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 43). The neoplastic cells expressed strong CD30 in a membranous and golgi staining pattern (Fig. 2B). They expressed ALK-1 within the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C), suggestive of an nucleophosmin-ALK translocation. They did not express CD25 and were Epstein-Barr virus-negative by EBER-1 (Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA-1) in situ hybridization. A T-cell receptor gene rearrangement study was performed by polymerase chain reaction using DNA extracted from the lymph node, which revealed a clonal T-cell population (data not shown). Based on the immunophenotypic and molecular studies, a diagnosis of ALCL, ALK-positive, was made. "
3376,S0090-4295(12)00570-5,A Case of Primary Renal Lymphoma," Differential Diagnosis The kidney may give rise to benign and malignant disease processes that present as an incidental solid renal mass with no metastatic findings. Although the benign lesions, such as oncocytoma, adenoma, and angiomyolipoma, are on the differential, the size of this mass is concerning for malignancy. Given that renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common cause of a malignant solid renal mass in an elderly patient, it was on the top of our differential. Due to the propensity of RCC to invade the renal vein and metastasize, rapid and aggressive therapy to remove the tumor is crucial in these cases. Primary urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) was also considered. UCC should be strongly considered for patients with risk factors, such as male gender, history of smoking, and advanced age. On imaging, this mass was found not to arise from the collecting system, so we thought that a primary UCC was less likely. Metastasis to the kidney from a distant primary tumor is an uncommon occurrence. However, it is important to note that metastasis to the kidney may mimic renal cell carcinoma. Identification of these tumors early in management is essential to avoid unnecessary surgery. Sarcoma of the kidney is rare in adults, and the optimal treatment is not clear. Lymphoma of the kidney was considered; however, most cases of renal lymphoma are secondary lesions, and this patient did not have any discernible lymphadenopathy. "
3410,S0022-510X(11)00618-6,Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma presenting as slowly progressive paraparesis with normal MRI features," 2 Case report We report a case of IVLBLC with neurological symptoms characterized by an atypical course and unusual MRI findings. Diagnosis was suspected ante-mortem, but was documented only postmortem. A 76-year-old woman was admitted to our Department of Neurology because of progressive paraparesis associated with hypoesthesia and numbness at the legs and urinary dysfunction for over six months. Two months before admission she had underwent surgery for ovarian cystadenoma, and 40years earlier splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis. On examination she had spastic paraparesis with mild hypertonus, bilateral extensor plantars, perineal and lower limb hypoesthesia. Blood tests showed markedly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 2400UI/l; normal range 230–460 UI/l), ?2-microglobulin (11.8mg/l; normal range 1.2–2.5mg/l), and ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) (65mm). Tumor markers were all negative, except for neuron specific enolase (29.4 and 44.8ng/ml; upper normal value 16.5ng/ml). Immunological tests including antineural antibodies associated with neurological paraneoplastic syndromes (anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti- Ma, anti-amphipysin, anti-cerebellum) were also negative. The CSF examination revealed slight increase in protein level (59mg/dl, normal range: 20–40) with normal glucose and cell count. Oligoclonal bands were absent with sign of blood–brain barrier damage (increased IgG/Alb ratio). On cytology no malignant cells were found, and microbiological and serological examination of CSF were also negative. Brain MRI showed patchy, non-specific lesions (hyperintense on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, without post-gadolinium enhancement) in the subcortical and deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, in particular involving centra semiovale and corona radiata (Fig. 1 ), suggestive for small-vessel ischemic disease [4]. MRI with gadolinium of the spine revealed no areas of abnormal intensity signal, although neurophysiological examinations (Motor Evoked Potentials, MEP and Somatosensory Evoked Potentials, SEP) were abnormal. MEP showed increased central motor conduction time for lower limb muscles. SEP showed normal cauda equina responses and absence of segmental centro-medullary response N14 after stimulation of right and left peroneus nerve, and increased latency of cortical response after stimulation of left peroneus nerve. Brain and spinal cord MRI with contrast were repeated after two months (about 20days before death) and showed again no remarkable findings. Because of clinical progression, steroid therapy (methylprednisolone intravenously 1g per day for five days) was started, with no beneficial effects on neurological symptoms. Laboratory findings showed a progressive increase of LDH levels up to 4295UI/l, associated with decrease in albumin levels (2.7g/dl), progressive impairment of hepatic function and thrombocytopenia, with elongation of aPTT. Abdominal and hepatic ultrasonography showed no morphological alterations, and total body CT scan was normal, except for the presence of some subcentimetric reactive lymph nodes, localized in many different districts (jugular, submandibular, submental, mesenteric, iliac, retroperitoneal, inguinal). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed hypercellularity with granulocytic hyperplasia (high increase of megakaryocytes, neutrophil granulocytes 81%, eosinophils 2%, monocytes 2%, blastes 3%, erythroid series 9%, lymphocytes 3%), but no evidence of malignancy was found. Despite negative bone marrow biopsy and CT findings, a lymphoproliferative disease, in particular an intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, was suspected on the basis of markedly increased LDH and ?2-microglobulin levels, neurological symptoms, and progressive deterioration of performance status. As alterations of hepatic function were indicative for liver involvement, we proposed a diagnostic hepatic biopsy, but the patient refused to undergo the procedure. Two months after admission, signs of hypopituitarism with low hormones levels were documented and a replacement therapy with cortisone acetate and l-thyroxine was started [1]. At day 70 after admission, the patient developed generalized edema and progressive hypoxemia, necessitating ventilatory support, and on day 79 she was transferred to the intensive care unit where she died due to multiorgan failure on day 83. In order to clarify the nature of the neurologic disease and the cause of death, an autopsy was performed. At necropsy a diffuse alveolar damage (ARDS) was identified as the primary cause of death (Fig. 2A–B). The brain was diffusely edematous and congested, the leptomeninges were opaque. No mass lesion could be found. Histological examination of lungs (Fig. 2A–B), kidney, central nervous system (Fig. 2C–D), heart (Fig. 2E) and liver (Fig. 2F) revealed intravascular collections of tumor cells with irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli. These cells were leukocyte common antigen (CD45) and CD20-positive, but CD3, CD43, CD45RO, and cytokeratin negative, supporting the diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. "
3411,S1579-2129(17)30399-3,Unilateral Lung Infiltrate: A Rare Form of Presentation of Primary Pulmonary Lymphoma,"We report the case of a 75-year-old man who consulted due to asthenia, anorexia, and weight loss of about 10kg in 3 months, accompanied by pleuritic pain in the left hemithorax and intermittent dyspnea. He also reported a perforating injury in the left hemithorax that occurred several years ago. No toxic habits or exposure to physical or chemical agents were recorded, and personal history included arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and atrial fibrillation with permanent anticoagulation. The only finding of interest on examination was cachexia with hypoventilation in both lung bases and basal oxygen saturation of 98%. A raised left hemidiaphragm associated with a basal area of pulmonary consolidation and extensive pleural thickening, consistent with diffuse pleural fibrosis, were observed on chest X-ray. Clinical laboratory tests revealed normocytic anemia consistent with chronic disorders, neutrophilia without leukocytosis, slightly elevated beta-2-microglobulin, and hypoalbuminemia with no evidence of clonal spikes. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor measuring 5.3×9.6cm, adjacent to the descending thoracic aorta, with contrast medium uptake, apparently in contact with the left lower lobar bronchus, associated with an extensive area of pleural calcification. No associated lymphadenopathies were observed (Fig. 1 ). The remaining exploratory studies were normal. A positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) was performed in order to determine the nature of the lesion and to complete the study. This procedure revealed increased metabolic activity in the lesion, with an increased cellular proliferation rate, and possible infiltration of the D9 vertebra and posterolateral region of the chest wall. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was ruled out, as the lesion would have been inaccessible with this technique. CT-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histological results showed Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) positive DLBCL-NOS. The patient was referred to the medical oncology clinic to plan treatment and follow-up."
3417,S2211-5684(12)00308-7,A hepatic and renal presentation of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma," Clinical case report A 37-year-old male attended a consultation due to the progressive appearance of jaundice and pruritus. He had no known medical history and no risk factors for chronic liver disease. He remained in good general health. Laboratory tests showed cholestasis with conjugated bilirubin changes (total bilirubin=450 ?moles/L), negative viral serology and a normal complete blood count. An abdominal sonogram demonstrated a single mass of the left liver, extending to the hepatic hilum, leading to dilated intrahepatic bile ducts. An MRI scan of the liver was carried out, which showed a left liver mass with slightly high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1a), low signal intensity on T1-weighted images (Fig. 1b), no enhancement with a Gadolinium contrast agent irrespective of the time since the injection (Fig. 1c) and even with delayed phase acquisition, and a non-dysmorphic liver. The intrahepatic bile ducts were noted to be dilated and there was left liver atrophy. This MRI also showed several rounded, sub-capsular renal masses that were isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images, homogenous, and did not enhance with use of a contrast agent (Fig. 2 ). These findings are all in opposition to those of a conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma, which is usually a single encapsulated lesion that is non-homogenous (having both solid and necrotic components), and shows increased vascularisation (early and intense enhancement). The proposed diagnosis was hepatic and renal lymphoma. A percutaneous needle biopsy of the mass at the left liver lobe was carried out and this led to confirmation of the diagnosis. Pathological assessment of the biopsy specimen showed tumour infiltration made up of medium to large cells with substantial nuclei and clear cytoplasm (Fig. 3 ). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the following phenotype: CD20+, CD5+ and Cyclin D1+, CD10–, BCL6– (Fig. 4 ). The final diagnosis was the pleomorphic variant of mantle cell lymphoma. "

Pathologic and molecular characterization of a single case,"Previously, other authors had published several cases of large B-cell lymphomas positive for cyclin D1 but without t(11;14) translocation [2,3], as cited in the article of Lucioni et al [1]."
3433,S0399-8320(10)00373-8,A rare case of mantle cell lymphoma as lymphomatous polyposis with widespread involvement of the digestive tract," Observation A 74-year-old man was admitted for gastrointestinal endoscopy to explore a positive Hemoccult® test. The patient had no bleeding or alteration of his general condition. The physical examination of abdomen was normal. His only past medical history consisted in an achalasia of the esophagus treated by Heller's cardiomyotomy. Upper and lower endoscopies were performed under general anesthesia. The endoscopic examinations objectified a disseminated polyposis in the stomach, duodenum, colon and rectum. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed two small ulcers in the antrum and duodenal polyps up to D2 with some greater than 1cm and ulcerated. Colonoscopy found the same type of polyps throughout the colon and the rectum (Fig. 1 ). Multiple biopsies of these polyps were performed. Histological examination showed a diffuse lymphomatous proliferation with small cells in the stroma, muscularis mucosae and extending to the submucosa. This lymphoid infiltrate repressed and stifled the epithelial structures but without lymphoepithelial lesions (Fig. 2 ). The tumoral B cells were of small to medium size. The immunohistochemical staining showed positivity of lymphoma cells for CD20, Bcl2, Bcl1 (cyclin D1) and CD43, and negativity for CD3, CD5, CD23 and CD10. The proliferation index assessed with the anit-Ki-67 was 15%. The same morphology and immunohistochemical staining was observed on polyps biopsies from different gastrointestinal localizations. The immunohistochemical profile was in accordance with a disseminated lymphomatous polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract corresponding to a B mantle cell lymphoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), which showed a cyclin D1 gene rearrangement. Physical examination revealed a left axillary lymph node and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes. Biologically, the complete blood count was normal with 8400/mm3 leukocytes, hemoglobin of 13.1g/dl and 187G/l platelets. The LDH was normal but beta-2 microglobulin increased to 3.2mg/l (normal lower than 2.2mg/l). There was no medullar invasion on the myelogram. Thoracic and abdominopelvic CT-scan highlighted the presence of multiple lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. Position emission tomography (PET-scan) showed an intense hypermetabolism of all the digestive structures, extending from the stomach to the rectal wall associated with multiple lymph nodes from the cervical to the inguinal regions. In conclusion, the patient had a MLP form of mantle cell lymphoma with involvement of stomach, duodenum, colon, rectum and lymph nodes. It was decided at a multidisciplinary meeting that an immunochemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone). The patient received 8 cycles of chemotherapy. The follow-up evaluation showed a partial response. There was a complete disappearance of adenopathy on CT-scan and PET-scan but a persistence of some gastrointestinal polyps with lymphoma cells. A chemotherapy consolidation with aracytine is performed. "

3455,S2210-2612(12)00085-5,Colonic lymphoma presenting acutely with perforated colo-splenic fistula," 2 Case report A 36-year-old immuno-competent male presented to the emergency room with 4-day history of severe colicky peri-umbilical pain which was radiating to the right flank and back with no relation to food. It was associated with intermittent fever and constipation but there was no associated vomiting or weight loss. He denied any history of urinary symptoms, but he admitted to joint pains and headache. On examination: he looked toxic with a temperature of 38.7°, pulse 100/min, with normal blood pressure and respiratory rate. Abdominal examination revealed left-sided abdominal tenderness with guarding and rigidity mostly in the left iliac fossa. It was difficult to appreciate any masses or organomegaly, but bowel sounds were audible. Clinical impression of acute diverticulitis was made and therefore he was started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics after full septic work up. His laboratory investigations revealed normal haemoglobin and platelet count but leucocytosis of 11.3 (80% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes) and high ESR of 70 and C-reactive protein of 32.6 (0–0.3)mg/dl. The urea, electrolytes and amylase were normal and sickle cell test was negative. The liver function test (LFT) was slightly disturbed with raised transaminases [GGT 90 (7–64), ALP 290 (50–136), ALT 122 (30–65), and AST 46 (15–37)] but normal LDH [144 (up to 190nl)]. HIV, Widal test, VDRL and brucella titres were all negative. His stool analysis was negative for ova and parasites. Skin tuberculin test (PPD) was negative, and tumor markers and echocardiography were normal. Chest and plain abdominal X-rays were unremarkable. Ultrasonography (US) of abdomen and pelvis showed enlarged heterogenous spleen with numerous hypoechoic patches of variable sizes likely to be splenic abscesses. Based on the US finding splenic tuberculosis was suspected and computerized tomography (CT) scan of abdomen was requested. After 24-h of conservative treatment, he remained pyrexial despite improvement in his general condition and abdominal signs (abdomen became soft and non tender). CT scan of the abdomen showed multiloculated splenic abscesses with suspected tears at the medial and lower side of the spleen involving the mesenteric fat and adherent to the left colon (Fig. 1 ). Peritoneal effusion with sporadic mesenteric lymphadeopathies was also noted. Blood culture grew Escherichia coli and therefore antibiotics were changed to intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin) 4.5g twice daily. As his clinical condition markedly improved (the fever settled with marked improvement in his general condition and abdominal signs), colonoscopy was performed on the 4th day after admission. A mass occupying more than 50% of the colon circumference at 75cm just proximal to splenic flexure with the possible site of perforation was noted (Fig. 2 ). Multiple biopsies were taken to exclude malignancy but this revealed marked active chronic inflammation suggesting diverticulitis rather than Crohn's disease. A week after his admission, repeat CT scan revealed an increase in the size of the splenic abscesses with spillage of colonic contrast into the abscess cavity was also demonstrated (Fig. 1). US-guided drainage was therefore performed; the affluent was pus at first but later became faeculent. As clinical condition was improving, conservative treatment was continued. However, after 10 days of admission, he became pyrexial again with increasing abdominal pains. He was taken for an emergency exploratory laparatomy. The findings were enlarged spleen with complete liquifaction of its inferior pole into the abscess cavity. There was also thickened splenic flexure with a well sealed abscess cavity, but rest of the abdominal cavity was clean. The site of perforation and fistulization into the spleen which was presumed to be a diverticular opening was identified and the abscess cavity contained faecoloma and pus. There were many hugely enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, but the liver was entirely normal. Frozen section of one excised fleshy mesenteric lymph node was negative for malignancy. The cavity was evacuated and the colon from mid transverse to mid descending colon was excised en-mass with the spleen (Fig. 3 ). A primary colo-colic stapled anastomosis was performed and the abscess cavity was drained. His postoperative course was uneventful except for a wound infection which was treated conservatively. Histopathology of the colo-splenic mass revealed diffuse high grade large cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with perforation of colonic wall and involvement of 14 pericolic and mesenteric lymph nodes out of 48 nodes. Identical tumor infiltration in the spleen with foci of infarction was also evident. Based on these results, a bone marrow biopsy was performed and found to be normal. Patient was staged III B colonic NHL and therefore was started on chemotherapy in the form of 6 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). He was discharged home 2 weeks after his operation and remained well 5 years after his operation without recurrence. "
3473,S0090-3019(01)00405-0,A case of primary spinal intramedullary lymphoma," Case report A 41-year-old male was admitted to our clinic with left hemiparesis of 1 month’s duration and marked left arm weakness. The patient was able to walk, his deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive, and there was a positive Babinski’s sign on the left. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed enlargement of the spinal cord and an intramedullary mass between C2 and C4 (Figure 1A).  We performed bilateral laminectomies at vertebrae C2, C3, and C4, and exposed a yellowish-white intramedullary tumor. Only subtotal resection was possible because of the invasive nature of the mass. Small tumor nodules that were observed on the exposed spinal cord and some of the visible spinal nerve roots were noted as metastatic seeding. The pathology report identified the tumor as a non-Hodgkin’s diffuse B-cell lymphoma (Figure 1B). The patient exhibited no additional neurological deficits in the early postoperative period, and was prescribed 32 mg/day dexamethasone to be taken in four equal doses. Contrast-enhanced (Gd-DTPA) MRI conducted immediately after surgery showed residual tumor tissue at C3 and C4. There were no abnormal findings on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and MRI studies of the thoracic and lumbosacral spinal cord, cranium, abdominopelvic area, and chest. Histopathological examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were also normal. Biochemical testing of the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid revealed slightly elevated glucose (151 mg/dL) and protein (440 mg/dL) levels. Hematological investigations including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood chemistry, and protein electrophoresis were normal, and the patient tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus. The diagnosis was primary intramedullary lymphoma of the cervical spinal cord. Based on the diagnosis and the fact that there was residual tumor tissue, the patient was started on a chemotherapy protocol of vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 i.v., first day of the cycle only), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2 i.v., first day only), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2 i.v., first day only), and prednisolone (100 mg per os, days 1–5). The chemotherapy protocol was repeated every 21 days for 6 cycles. After the fourth cycle, adjuvant radiotherapy was administered in the cervical region, with a total radiation dose of 4500 cGy. The remaining two chemotherapy cycles were completed after radiotherapy. At 6 months after surgery, contrast-enhanced cervical MRI showed no residual intramedullary lesion (Figure 1C). By the ninth month, the patient’s hemiparesis had improved and he was showing no additional neurological deficits. However, at 11 months postsurgery he was admitted to the emergency department with sudden-onset motor aphasia and tetraparesis. Contrast-enhanced cranial MRI revealed small tumor nodules in the third and fourth ventricles (Figure 1D). Spinal MRI at this stage showed no lesion. "
3475,S0304-3835(98)00278-X,B-Cell lymphoma of 708 cases in Japan: incidence rates and clinical prognosis according to the REAL classification," 2 Materials and methods Over the 20-year period from 1975 to 1994, 708 patients with B-cell lymphoma were identified in the lymph node registry files of the Department of Pathology, Fukuoka University. In all cases, the B-cell phenotype was confirmed and the clinical follow-up data could be analyzed. The patients with B-cell neoplasms of bone marrow, including myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, were excluded from analysis. The samples were fixed in buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin–eosin, Giemsa, PAS and Gomori’s for silver impregnation, L26 (CD20) and/or CD79a for B cells, UCHL-1 (CD45RO) and/or CD3 for T cells (Dakopatts), Leu-M1 (CD15), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD5, CD23, bcl-1, bcl-2, ?, ?, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, EMA and/or Ber H2 (CD30) (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark; Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA; Supertec, Bethesda, MD; Novocastra, Newcastle, UK). A portion of each sample was kept at ?80°C in a deep freezer and the nodes were examined using the monoclonal antibodies CD2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 19, 20, 30 and sIg (Coulter, Hialeah, FL; Ortho, Raritan, NJ; Becton-Dickinson; Dakopatts). In some cases, other parts of the frozen materials were used for DNA isolation and gene analysis. The details of the examination methods have all been reported previously [22]. The frozen materials were confirmed as consisting of lymphoma cells, T-cell receptor genes C?, J? and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (JH) gene.  2.1 Definition of B-cell type: phenotype and genotype Lymphoblastic lymphoma and other types of B-cell (peripheral B-cell) lymphoma showed slightly different phenotypes and genotypes. B-Cell type lymphoblastic lymphoma was diagnosed by the expression of one or more pan-B cell antigens (CD19 and CD20) and the absence of pan-T cell antigens (CD45RO, CD2, CD3 and CD7). The lymphoblastic cells were typically CD10+ and TdT+. The rearrangements of Ig JH genes were occasionally detected, while TCR ? and/or ? rearrangements were rare. Peripheral B-cell lymphoma was also diagnosed by the expression of one or more pan-B cell antigens (CD19, CD20 and CD79a) and the absence of pan-T cell antigens (CD45RO, CD2, CD3 and CD7) and T-cell associated antigens (CD4 or CD8). The rearrangements of Ig JH genes were frequently detected and TCR ? and/or ? genes were germline. In addition, the tumor cells of mantle cell lymphoma were typically CD5+ and bcl-1+ and the tumor cells of prolymphocytic lymphoma were CD23+.   2.2 Morphological classification The morphological classification was basically done according to the REAL classification of the International Lymphoma Study Group [11]. Brief morphological features are summarized in Table 1 . In this re-classification study, we modified the classifications to clarify the high grade MALT, mantle cell lymphoma with transformation and variants of large B-cell lymphoma. The important points in the modified classification were as follows.  2.2.1 Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT (1) Low grade MALT was composed of small marginal zone cells. (2) High grade MALT was composed of large cells in places and included low grade MALT with high grade components. (3) Large cell lymphoma without lymphoepithelial lesions was classified into diffuse large cell lymphoma.   2.2.2 Mantle cell lymphoma The mantle cell lymphoma was classified into two types, i.e. with and without cytological transformation. In the present study, the blastic type could not be confirmed because chromosomal analysis and genetic analysis of bcl-1 were not performed.   2.2.3 Diffuse large cell lymphoma The diffuse large cell lymphoma was classified into the common type and the variant type. The variant type included immunoblastic lymphoma, centroblastic lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, thymic large B-cell lymphoma, intravascular lymphoma and pyothorax-associated lymphoma.   2.2.4 Follicular lymphoma The follicular lymphoma was classified into two types, i.e. grade 1, which was composed of small cells, medium-sized cells and/or large cells, and grade 2, which was composed only of large cells. In the classification, the morphologic features and immunohistochemical analysis were used. However, in the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, a few cases lacked the specific immunohistochemical data, such as CD5 and bcl-1.    2.3 Statistical analysis A statistical analysis (generalized Wilcoxon test) of the Kaplan–Meier survival curves was performed (SAS system, SAS Institute, NC).

On physical examination, the patient proved to have an excessive enlargement of the right upper eyelid, which was painless and hard-elastic on palpation. There was a protrusion of the conjunctiva through the palpebral fissure, which severely impaired the visual ability of the right eye. The ophthalmologic examination demonstrated a right eye proptosis, and did not revealed any further abnormal signs. A CT-scan was performed, which confirmed the existence of a large, ill-defined mass in the upper area of the right orbit. There was no involvement of the bony structures or the muscle cone. A biopsy was performed, under local anaesthesia, through an upper eyelid incision. The pathology examination showed a large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to the Haematology/Oncology Department, for further treatment. The clinical and imaging examinations did not revealed any systemic spread. The patient underwent chemotherapy, and there was a good tumor and clinical response, with no local or systemic relapse in follow-up examinations."

3559,S0303-8467(12)00147-3,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with foot drop," 2 Case report A 59-year old man was referred from his general practitioner to our neurology department because of a foot drop and sensory deficit over the left lateral calf. Four months previously, the patient had a sudden onset of radiating back pain triggered by heavy lifting. The condition was diagnosed as lumbar disc herniation based on clinical evaluation, and no diagnostic imaging studies were made. The medical history also included follicular lymphoma, which had been diagnosed two years earlier, and the patient had been in complete remission for one year by the time of onset of foot drop. The patient's complaints were weakness of his left foot and numbness of his left lateral calf. The symptoms started one month before admission, and had since then been gradually worsening. He had mild lower back pain which was non-radiating. There was no preceding history of any trauma or chronic nerve compression. The patient's family history was not suggestive of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) or any other hereditary neuropathy. The patient presented a characteristic steppage gait, and the neurological examination revealed a complete paralysis of dorsiflexion and eversion of the left foot and dorsiflexion of left toes. Motor strength in the lower limbs was otherwise normal. There was a sensory deficit over the lateral calf, the dorsum of the foot and digit III–V. The Achilles tendon reflexes were weak bilaterally and patellar reflexes were normal. Flexor plantar response was present bilaterally. The anal sphincter tone was normal. There was no pain on straight leg raise test. General physical examination showed no sign of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Because of a history of possible lumbar disc herniation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine was performed, revealing a small median protrusion of the disc at L5 with no compression of the nerve roots. The patient was then referred to neurophysiological examination. The results of the nerve conduction study (NCS) in the left leg are shown in Table 1 . Motor conduction study of the left peroneal nerve showed normal amplitudes of compound motor action potential (CMAP) in the tibialis anterior and peroneal muscles plus the extensor digitorum muscle. The amplitude of the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) recorded with near-nerve needles just distal to the fibular head and 11cm above was normal. The motor conduction velocity was normal across the knee and on crus. The sensory conduction was normal on crus and slightly decreased across the knee. No F-wave responses could be elicited on the left side, whereas they were present when stimulating the right peroneal nerve. Needle electromyography (EMG) demonstrated profuse spontaneous activity (fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves) in the peroneus longus and tibialis anterior muscles, indicating loss of motor fibers (Table 2 ). Only a few motor unit potentials (MUPs) could be recorded during the patients attempt to contract the muscles at maximal effort. EMG of the biceps femoris muscle showed normal findings. On the basis of these findings it could be concluded that; (1) the lesion was not located at the fibular head, but in an area proximal to the recording and stimulating site in the popliteal fossa, and distal to the branch given off to the short head of the biceps femoris muscle and (2) the viability of the nerve was immediately threatened due to the combination of profuse denervation activity in muscles with a normal amplitude of CMAP and SNAP. MRI of the left thigh and knee was then performed, revealing a fusiform tumour in the sciatic nerve (Fig. 1 ). A tissue biopsy of the tumour adjacent to the nerve revealed non-Hodgkin lymphoma with giant B-cells of follicular origin. MRI of the abdomen showed several enlarged lymph nodes. The patient was referred to a haematological department for further treatment including chemotherapy, autologous bone marrow transplant and radiotherapy applied to the lymphoma in the left thigh. Clinically the patient regained normal function of the nerve nine weeks after initial admission. "
3563,S0016-5107(98)70303-7,Simultaneous coexistence of early adenocarcinoma and low-grade MALT lymphoma of the stomach associated with Helicobacter pylori infection: a case report," Case Report A 47-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital in June 1994 because of abdominal fullness. Physical examination and laboratory data showed no abnormalities. An upper gastrointestinal roentgenogram showed multiple ulcers and a diffuse granular pattern in the antrum. Endoscopy revealed multiple ulcers in the antrum surrounded by diffuse granular mucosa (Fig. 1A).   Figure 1   A, Endoscopic images: a gastric MALT lymphoma showing multiple ulcers in the antrum surrounded by diffuse granular mucosa. B, A type IIc early gastric carcinoma (arrow): a well-demarcated, irregularly shaped depressed lesion with converging mucosal folds broken at the margin of the lesion, on the lesser curvature of the prepylorus.    In addition, on the lesser curvature of the prepylorus, there was a well-demarcated, irregularly shaped depressed lesion that was consistent with a type IIc early gastric carcinoma (Fig. 1B). Histologic examination of biopsy specimens obtained from multiple ulcers and diffuse granular mucosa revealed a low-grade MALT lymphoma, whereas those from the depressed lesion revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. We thus diagnosed the simultaneous coexistence of early adenocarcinoma and low-grade MALT lymphoma of the stomach. Biopsy specimens obtained from normally appearing antral mucosa showed a mild chronic inflammation without intestinal metaplasia. No H. pylori organisms were detected in the biopsy specimens. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed diffuse thickening of the second and third mural layers in the antrum, suggesting that the lymphoma massively invaded the submucosa, but not the muscularis propria (Fig. 2).   Figure 2  Endoscopic ultrasonography depicting diffuse thickening of the second and third mural layers in the antrum, suggesting that the lymphoma is localized in the mucosa and submucosa.    The carcinoma was not identified on EUS. Bone marrow examination and gallium scintigraphy revealed no abnormalities, and CT showed no findings suggestive of metastatic disease in the thorax or abdomen. Both tumors were thus considered to be localized in the stomach, and a total gastrectomy was performed. Macroscopically, the resected specimen revealed a diffuse granular pattern measuring about 10 × 6 cm in the antrum, suggesting a superficially spreading type lymphoma. On the lesser curvature of the prepylorus, a type IIc early carcinoma, measuring 3.5 × 2.5 cm, was also observed. Histologic examination of the resected specimen revealed the former lesion to be a low-grade MALT lymphoma localized in the mucosa and submucosa and the latter to be an intramucosal, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells. A collision of both neoplastic components was seen in the intermediate zone between the two lesions (Fig. 3).   Figure 3  Histologic section of the resected specimen. A collision of both neoplastic components, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells (arrowhead) and low-grade MALT lymphoma, is seen in the intermediate zone between the two lesions. (Hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification  ×10).    The surrounding nonneoplastic antral mucosa exhibited a mild to moderate chronic nonatrophic gastritis with many lymphoid follicles. Neither mucosal atrophy nor intestinal metaplasia was recognized. A small number of H. pylori organisms was proven by an immunohistochemical technique using a polyclonal antibody, B471 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The patient was discharged without undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. During the 2 years of follow-up after his surgery, there has been no evidence of a recurrence of either neoplasm. "
3567,S0344-0338(11)00140-3,"A small cell variant of ALK-positive, CD8-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with primary subcutaneous presentation mimicking subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma"," Case report The patient was a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed progressive subcutaneous nodules on the right arm and swelling above the elbow. He noted new nodules on the scalp and neck area within a two-week period. These nodular skin lesions spread to the cheeks, chest, and bilateral shoulders in a week. A deep skin punch biopsy of the upper chest wall (biopsy 1) was performed and showed histopathologic features consistent with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL). During the next few weeks, his subcutaneous nodules and arm swelling spontaneously resolved without corresponding treatment, but cutaneous nodules subsequently recurred in multiple other sites. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a few mildly enlarged lymph nodes within the left subpectoral region and several small subpleural lung nodules. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed multiple hypermetabolic subcutaneous nodules involving the face, neck, chest wall, back, left hip, and bilateral proximal extremities (Fig. 1 ). The small lung nodules and lymph nodes, however, were not noted to contain abnormal activity suggestive of lymphomatous involvement. One large lymph node in the right axilla was noted but was interpreted as lymphadenopathy due to local drainage. A tru-cut biopsy of a left hip subcutaneous lesion (biopsy 2) demonstrated a lymphoid infiltrate similar to biopsy 1, with features consistent with SPTCL. Due to disease progression (frequent recurrence of subcutaneous nodules), chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) was started with initial improvement, but, subsequently, new skin nodules developed. A biopsy of the medial right arm subcutaneous nodules (biopsy 3) showed features consistent with the previous diagnosis of SPTCL, but a CD30 stain was ordered this time and found to be positive. An ALK immunohistochemical stain was then performed and found to be positive in neoplastic T-cells, raising the possibility of ALK-positive ALCL. He received another cycle of CHOP therapy with additional Targretin (bexarotene) and Gemcitabine for progression of the disease, but his response to the treatment was poor. During his hospital course, the patient developed several episodes of chills, rigors, and night sweats along with signs of renal insufficiency and other organ failure. He then became lethargic and progressively nonresponsive and eventually died approximately five months after the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma (2.5 months after starting chemotherapy). "

The preoperative enhanced CT image for renal cell carcinoma showed 7?mm sized low-density mass accompanied with localized parenchymal atrophy in the segment ? of the liver, which was not identified by anyone (Fig. 1 a). Followed-up CT for post-surgery of RCC was periodically undergone. Two years later from RCC surgery, the low-density mass of the liver had been slightly enlarged to be 11?mm in diameter on enhanced CT (Fig. 1b). Trans-abdominal echogram showed low-echoic and border-clear mass in 18?mm diameter (Fig. 2 a). On gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI), the mass showed low intensity and perinodular early enhancement in T1-weighted image, and Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake in the mass was not observed in the hepatobiliary phase (Fig. 2b). She had no risk factors developing hepatocellular carcinoma such as hepatitis B or C virus infection and alcoholic hepatitis. On these image and clinical findings, we suspected of inflammatory pseudotumor because localized parenchymal atrophy was accompanied with the mass. The malignant neoplasm such as primary or metastatic one, however, could not completely denied due to findings of gradual enlargement for two years and no Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake in the mass. She desired definite diagnosis by undergoing surgery, and so we performed laparoscopic partial hepatectomy in the segment ?. She had no surgery-related complication such as bile leak and intraabdominal abscess, and left the hospital on postoperative day 7. The resected mass showed white and solid nodule. On gross appearance, surgical margin of the mass was kept to the cut surface (Fig. 3 a). In the hematoxylin and eosin staining, monoclonal and dense lymphocyte and plasma cells without liver parenchyma were infiltrated in the nodule (Fig. 3b). Steatosis was seen underlying liver parenchyma (Fig. 3c). Beside the nodule, atrophic liver parenchyma with lymphocyte infiltration, pericellular fibrosis, and bridging fibrosis in the periportal vein were observed (Fig. 3d). The germinal center-like lesions including cells with clear cytoplasm were also observed. In immunohistological staining, a number of CD3 and 5 positive cells were infiltrated in the perifollicular lesion (Fig. 4 a). CD20 positive cells were also observed moderately. In the follicular lesion, infiltrated cells were positive for CD10 and negative for bcl-2 and cyclin D1 (Fig. 4b–d). Pathological diagnosis was pseudolymphoma of the liver. Two months later from partial hepatectomy, enhanced CT examining from neck to pelvis showed no abnormal lymph node suspecting of malignant lymphoma or the other lymphoprolifeative disorders and no recurrence findings of both hepatic pseudolymphoma and RCC. Abdominal echography underwent five months later from hepatectomy also showed no recurrence in the remnant liver. "
3608,S0046-8177(10)00207-8,Concurrent classical Hodgkin lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with fludarabine: a dimorphic presentation of iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder with evidence suggestive of multiclonal transformability of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus," 2 Case report Our patient was a 69-year-old man diagnosed with CLL/SLL on a stomach biopsy. A bone marrow biopsy at the time demonstrated 75% CLL involvement of an 80% cellular bone marrow. A computed tomography (CT) scan performed approximately 17 months after initial diagnosis revealed increased lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The patient was then started on chemotherapy with fludarabine and five months later completed 6 cycles. Although he initially responded to treatment, a CT/positron tomography scan about a half year after treatment demonstrated recurrent disease. He was then treated with five weekly doses of rituximab, inducing clinical remission. For the next 9 months the patient showed no clinical evidence of disease, but later developed right cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to antibiotics. He was subsequently noted to have pancytopenia, pneumonia, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a nasopharyngeal mass. At that time, a CT of the sinuses and neck revealed a soft tissue mass in the tonsillar pillars and adenoidal region, occupying the nasopharynx and measuring 5.0 × 2.7 × 4.1 cm. Also observed were multiple bilateral enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and superior mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. His lactate dehydrogenase was elevated to 1054 U/L. A bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometric analysis detected 3% monoclonal B-cells consistent with CLL/SLL. An initial biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass demonstrated large areas of coagulative necrosis with only rare large cells, and the sample was thus considered insufficient for a definitive diagnosis. An alternative excisional biopsy of the enlarged left cervical lymph node exhibited histopathological features consistent with a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). The patient received five cycles of rituximab 375 mg/m2 (800 mg), cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 (1550 mg), doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 (50 mg), vincristine 2 mg, and prednisone 100 mg daily, with some decrease in his lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, but his nasopharyngeal mass persisted. A repeat biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass demonstrated findings suggestive of PBL. The patient was then treated with localized radiation to the nasopharynx. His condition continued to decline, and he developed renal failure, severe oral/nasal mucositis due to local radiotherapy, malnutrition, and altered mental status, and was thus unable to receive further intense chemotherapy. The patient eventually succumbed to multiorgan failure and metabolic acidosis approximately 9 months after the presentation of concurrent cHL and PBL (2 months after discontinuation of chemotherapy/radiotherapy).  2.1 Pathologic findings The hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) sections of the left cervical lymph node biopsy demonstrated effacement of lymph node architecture by scattered Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin cells in a background of heterogeneous inflammatory cells, including small lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and eosinophils (Fig. 1 ). Residual CLL/SLL was focally present on some sections and was also detected by concurrent flow cytometric analysis (data not shown). Immunohistochemical studies showed the large Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin cells to be strongly positive for CD30 with membranous/Golgi zone staining pattern (Fig. 1, inset); in addition, they showed positivity for MUM1 and focal, weak expression of CD79a and Pax5 but were negative for CD15, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23, CD43, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 1. Although anti–EBV–EBV nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA2) was negative, the large Hodgkin cells were positive for EBV-latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) (Fig. 1B1). In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was positive in the large Hodgkin cells but was distinctly negative in the small bystander lymphocytes (Fig. 1B2). The morphology and immunophenotypic profile supported a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in addition to a separate focus of CLL/SLL. The H and E section of the nasopharyngeal mass lesion revealed monomorphic large plasmacytoid or plasmablastoid cells with frequent apoptosis and focal necrosis (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the plasmacytoid/plasmablastoid cells expressed weak CD45 and bright CD138 (Fig. 1C, inset), BCL2 and MUM1; they were also focally positive for epithelial membrane antigen, CD31, and BCL6 but were apparently negative for CD20, CD79a, PAX5, CD56, and all the T-cell antigens applied. More than 90% of plasmacytoid/plasmablastoid cells were in the proliferation cycle, assessed by Ki67 stain (Fig. 1D). Although EBV immunohistochemical stains with anti–EBV-LMP-1 and anti–EBV-EBNA2 were negative, the more sensitive EBER in situ hybridization (ISH) was positive in many large cells (Fig. 1D, inset). A diagnosis of PBL was made based on morphologic features, immunophenotypic profile and EBER ISH test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based immunoglobulin (IG) gene rearrangement studies were performed on both the CLL/SLL-rich section of the left cervical lymph node biopsy and the nasopharyngeal mass with PBL. Although the specimen from the cervical lymph node showed a clonal rearrangement of IG heavy chain gene (IGH), no amplifiable clonal rearrangement of IGH was detected in the biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass lesion. However, two distinct, clonally rearranged products of IG ? light chain gene (IGK) were amplified from these two tissue sites (Fig. 2 ), suggesting that the PBL is clonally unrelated to the CLL/SLL. Microdissection of the CD30-positive Hodgkin cells on the cervical lymph node was performed, and IGH/K gene rearrangement analyses were attempted on extracted DNA from collected CD30-positive Hodgkin cells but did not detect amplifiable clonal rearrangement. Therefore, the clonal relationship of cHL to either CLL/SLL or PBL could not be assessed in this case. The clinical findings and pathological features in CLL, cHL and PBL in the present case are summarized in Table 1 .  "

3638,S0022-5347(01)67637-7,Case Reports: Primary Penile Lymphoma Presenting as a Penile Ulcer," CASE REPORT An 18-year-old circumcised man presented with a 7-month history of a painless penile ulcer. He denied self-mutilation. The lesion began as a white pustule on the dorsum of the penis proximal to the corona, and it gradually enlarged and became a 2.0 x 1.5 cm. ulcer. Physical examination was otherwise normal. The patient was treated for presumed venereal disease with several courses of antibiotics and antifungal agents as well as local wound care without improvement. Tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, human immune deficiency virus and fungi were negative. Three months after the lesion appeared, it was debrided and biopsied with findings of “marked acute and chronic inflammation and granulation tissue.” Due to an unstable social situation and the negative diagnostic evaluation of the penile lesion, a factitious injury was suspected. Psychiatric evaluation revealed no evidence of psychosis. After 2 additional months of evaluation and therapy without improvement the patient was admitted to our hospital. The lesion now measured 3 x 5 cm. and occupied the entire dorsum and half the circumference of the penis (Figure 1 ). There was no evidence of infection. The patient also had daily temperature elevations to 38.9C. Extensive debridement and biopsy revealed diffuse large cell immunoblastic lymphoma extending into the corpora cavernosa (Figure 2 ). Metastatic evaluation included a normal bone marrow aspirate and chest radiograph. Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a small low density lesion in the anterior right lobe of the liver but needle biopsy revealed no evidence of lymphoma. The tumor was stage IE (single extra lymphatic site according to the Ann Arbor staging classification 9 ) with B symptoms (fever). Therapy consisted of 8 courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. During the 7-month course of treatment the ulcer gradually healed but with significant scar (Figure 3 ). However, the patient reported normal erectile function and did not desire cosmetic surgery. He has had regular followup evaluations and remains free of recurrence 27 months after diagnosis. "

3667,S2152-2650(12)00008-0,Is the Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma Beneficial to Avoid CD4+ Lymphopenia and Other AIDS Manifestations in Patients Infected With Human Immunodeficiency Virus?," Introduction Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is one of the more rare T-cell lymphomas in Western countries. 1  AITL involves multiple organs and is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, fever, and skin rash. 1,2  This neoplasm frequently presents with autoimmune features and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, which previously led AITL to be considered a type of non-neoplastic hyperplasia. 1,2  AITL is now widely recognized as a type of lymphoma, 1  but a limited understanding of its pathogenesis and behavior persists. It is known that AITL derives from centrofollicular CD4+ helper T-cells, which are believed to undergo a series of mutations influenced by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and other viral infections. 1,3   AIDS is characterized by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induced depletion of CD4+ T cells, which creates an immunocompromised environment and renders the host increasingly susceptible to opportunistic infections and development of B-cell lymphomas. 4  With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the incidence rates of both opportunistic infections and secondary malignancies have decreased in patients with HIV, whereas a similar decline in lymphoma incidence has not been observed in the general population. 5  Accordingly, many B-cell lymphomas are considered AIDS-defining entities. Perhaps due to the use of novel antiretroviral drugs, there have been recent reports of T-cell lymphomas developing in patients with HIV. These cases are commonly positive for CD8, CD30, or CD4, but the diagnosis of AITL remains rare. 5  To the best of our knowledge, this is an unusual AITL case that developed in an patient who was HIV positive, perhaps due to the clonal proliferation of CD4+ cells, who has failed to develop the complete clinical and laboratory manifestations of AIDS.

She felt uncomfortable with dental bite, but she did not have pain. There was no other systemic symptom. Her parents brought her to a dental clinic, where dentist suspected the presence of tumor in her jaw with a radiograph showing lytic bone changes (Fig. 1A). For further examination, she was transferred to our hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed tumors were present in the mandible involving dental arch and soft tissues (Fig. 1B and C). The clinical differential diagnosis included lymphoma and Ewing's sarcoma. Biopsy specimen demonstrated small round cells with mildly irregular nuclear contours (Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemical stains showed cells were positive for CD79a (Fig. 1E) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (Fig. 1F). Tumor cells were negative for CD3. The bone marrow biopsy, hematological analysis and chemical analysis were normal. A diagnosis of precursor B-LBL was made. She was treated with an aggressive multiagent chemotherapy regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After treatment the tumors were disappeared and accordingly her jaw swelling was dramatically reduced (Fig. 1G and H). She is disease free at a follow-up interval of 11 years."

3691,S0022-510X(10)00639-8,Intravascular lymphoma presenting as a longitudinally-extensive myelitis: Diagnostic challenges and etiologic clues," 2 Case report An 82-year old woman was admitted for a subacute onset, progressive lower limb weakness and numbness. Four weeks prior to admission she developed left lower limb numbness and weakness accompanied by symptoms suggestive of a neurogenic bladder. Three weeks into her illness she was given one gram of methylprednisolone intravenously for 5days. No improvement was noted. One week prior to admission she developed right lower limb numbness and weakness. Her past history was remarkable for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoarthritis. Her uterus had been removed many years ago following an abnormal Pap smear. For the preceding year she had been diagnosed with a normocytic normochromic anemia of indeterminate cause. Anemia possibly related to chronic disease or a myelodysplastic syndrome was a likely considerations; no confirmatory diagnostic tests were performed. Medications at the time of admission included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, omeprazole, and naproxen. She had no family history of a neurologic disease. Her neurologic exam was remarkable for bilateral, left greater than right, upper motor neuron pattern of lower limb weakness. Lower limb reflexes were symmetrically brisk with extensor plantar responses. A sensory level to pin prick was present at the L2 dermatome. Perception of vibration was reduced in the lower limbs: to the anterior superior iliac spine on the left and to the ankle on the right. Normal or negative serological investigations included electrolytes, liver enzymes, creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin B12 and E, folate, copper, and protein immunoelectrophoresis. Her hemoglobin was reduced to 9.9g/dl (normal: 12–15.5g/dl) and platelet count was reduced to 103×109/l (normal: 150–450×109/l). The white blood cell count was normal. Iron studies were notable for an elevated serum ferritin of 663?g/l (normal: 11–307?g/l). The myelodysplastic syndrome fluorescence in-situ hybridization panel was normal. Rheumatologic serologies revealed an elevated rheumatoid factor to 257IU/ml (normal: <15IU/ml). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme level, antiphospholipid antibodies, thyroperoxidase antibodies, tissue transglutaminase antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and antinuclear antibody were normal. Serologies for Lyme, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Paraneoplastic antibodies (including antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channel, glutamic acid decarboxylase, collapsin response mediator protein-5, amphiphysin) were negative. Neuromyelitis optica immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG) was negative. Visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were normal. Brain and cervical spine MRI done with gadolinium were unremarkable. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were unremarkable. A thoracic spine MRI done 2weeks into her illness showed a longitudinal intramedullary T2-hyperintensity from T7 to T11 (Fig. 1A). The cord was slightly enlarged at this level. A thoracic spine MRI repeated after admission showed a slight proximal increase in the extent of the signal change (Fig. 1B1) with subtle central enhancement (Fig. 1B2). There was no significant edema or leptomeningeal enhancement. No dorsal flow voids were noted and spinal MR angiography revealed no evidence of a dural arteriovenous fistula. A CSF study showed no increase in the white blood cell count. CSF protein was elevated to 110mg/dl (normal: 14–45mg/dl) and CSF myelin basic protein was elevated to 7.4ng/ml (normal: 0–1ng/ml). CSF oligoclonal bands, IgG index and synthesis rate were normal. A CSF study repeated after admission showed a lesser degree of protein elevation and again no increase in CSF cell counts. NMO-IgG in CSF was negative. A comprehensive microbiologic work up on the CSF was unrevealing. Cytological examination for malignant cells was negative. The patient was treated with 5 plasma exchanges for a suspected idiopathic thoracic myelitis (“transverse myelitis”). Clinical improvement followed the plasma exchange initially, allowing dismissal from the hospital with improvement in motor strength. Days after dismissal however she had worsened right lower limb weakness requiring readmission three weeks later. Repeat thoracic spine MRI (Fig. 1C1) showed an additional area of intramedullary signal change at T4–5, extension of the distal intramedullary signal change to the conus, and a slight increase in the T10 enhancement (Fig. 1C2). Repeat CSF study again did not show any increased cellularity. Plasma exchange was reinitiated. Despite 7 exchanges no clinical improvement was noted. A spinal angiogram and body positron emission tomography scan were done but failed to provide clues to the cause of the myelopathy. Nonspecific tracer uptake in the bowel led to a nondiagnostic capsule endoscopy. CSF study was repeated for the fourth time and was again unremarkable except for the persisting protein elevation. Continued worsening was noted on the thoracic spine MRI; the extent of the intramedullary T2-signal change increased proximally and distally (Fig. 1D1), and the degree of T10 enhancement was more evident (Fig. 1D2). A conjunctival biopsy was unremarkable. Three additional plasma exchanges did not result in any improvement. A transthoracic ECHO showed biatrial enlargement, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension. A serum LDH done a few days prior to her demise was elevated to 488U/l (normal: 122–222U/l). She developed a worsening mental status and died a few days later. A full autopsy was performed. The spinal cord showed gross duskiness and congestion of the distal cord was noted (Fig. 2A). Hematoxylin and eosin spinal cord sections showed large atypical cells within intermediate to small sized hyalinized vessels in nerve roots and spinal cord parenchyma (Fig. 2B). Subacute and chronic ischemic cord changes associated with microvessel hyalinization and microthrombi were present (Fig. 2C). The neoplastic cells coexpressed the B-cell markers CD20 (Fig. 2D) and PAX5 (Fig. 2E), and were negative for CD3 and CD34 by immunohistochemistry. CD34 positivity was noted in the endothelial cells highlighting the intravascular nature of the neoplastic infiltrate (Fig. 2F). The findings were diagnostic of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma with predominant involvement of the spinal cord at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar, and nerve root levels. Patchy microscopic involvement of cerebellar vessels, subcortical white matter, and optic nerves was also noted. The sternal bone marrow was hypercellular and showed atypical large B-cells positive for CD20. "
3696,S1571-4675(11)00048-4,Peritonitis as the primary manifestation of atypical T-cell lymphoma of the small bowel with unsuspected celiac disease: MDCT features," 2 Case history A 46-year-old caucasian man was admitted to our emergency department for abdominal pain in March 2007. His prior history was remarkable for major depressive disorder for which he was receiving a treatment including loxapine, alprazolam and diazepam. His abdominal symptoms appeared over the previous three days with vomiting and abdominal pain. Clinically, he presented with abdominopelvic pain and abdominal guarding. Vital signs were normal, except for a temperature of 101°F. He was noted to have leukocytosis (12.2×109/L), elevated C-reactive protein (322.0mg/L), hypoalbuminemia (20g/L) and prolonged prothrombin time (international normalized ratio, 1.5) in the absence of anticoagulant treatment. The patient did not have abdominal plain film. Multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) revealed extra-intestinal free gas, with abdominopelvic free fluid effusion, diffuse thickening of the small bowel, paucity of jejunal folds, and multiple, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 1 ). In addition, focal mass of the jejunal wall was noticed. MDCT findings were consistent with peritonitis secondary to free gastrointestinal perforation. Diffuse thickening of the small bowel and rarity of jejunal folds, in association with biological signs of malabsorption suggested celiac disease. Emergency surgical exploration revealed diffuse peritonitis, multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with jejunal perforation. Partial jejunal resection was performed with peritoneal lavage and drainage, followed by subsequent double-barrel jejunostomy. Histopathological analysis of resected jejunal specimen revealed EATL (Fig. 2 ) with marked changes of jejunal mucosa consistent with celiac disease. Immunohistochemical staining on the jejunal lesion was positive for CD3, CD8, and CD30 but negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), CD56 and CD57. Further immunophenotypic analysis showed expression of granzyme B and T-cell restricted intracellular antigen (TIA-1) indicating a cytotoxic T-cell origin of the EATL [2]. The tumor was definitely classified as pleomorphic large cell lymphoma. Atrophic mucosa contained intraepithelial lymphocytes, all with normal phenotype (CD3+, CD8+), without clonal expansion. Resected lymph nodes were negative for lymphomatous involvement. Analysis of multiple duodenal biopsies obtained during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, crypt hyperplasia in association with total villous atrophy, consistent a type 3C celiac disease [3]. Anti-gliadin IgG and IgA antibodies and anti-endomysial antibodies were strongly positive and anti-transglutaminase IgA was moderately positive. Search for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA was negative. Reassessment of initial MDCT images did not show cavitating lymph nodes nor hyposplenism. The patient received six courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, oncovin and prednisolone) chemotherapy and gluten-free diet was started. The patient underwent extensive staging with positron emission tomography (PET)-CT with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG), which did not show any abnormal uptake. Closure of the double barrel jejunostomy was performed five weeks later. Further clinical evaluation did not reveal findings consistent with dermitis herpetiformis. On March 2008, repeated duodenal biopsies showed favorable response to gluten-free diet with histologic recovery of villous structures. On November 2010, the patient was doing well. He was fully compliant to gluten free-diet. Abdominopelvic MDCT and 18FDG/PET-CT did not reveal recurrent disease. "

The patient was initially diagnosed with cellulitis, and antibiotics were prescribed. After 1 week of antibiotics, her symptoms continued to worsen. On physical examination, the left breast was tense; the skin was diffusely red and thickened with raised erythematous lesions. A 2-cm mass was detected by palpation in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast. No abnormalities were detected in the right breast. Ill-defined fullness was noted in both axillary regions. Mammography revealed a large, central left breast mass with global skin thickening and prominent trabecular markings (Fig. 1A). No abnormalities were noted in the right breast (Fig. 1A). Ultrasound revealed global skin thickening with increased vascularity and diffuse architectural distortion in the left breast (Fig. 1B). Several ill-defined, vascular, hypoechoic masses were identified in the left breast, the largest of which measured 6 cm in its greatest diameter. In the left axillary region, a 2-cm lymph node with a prominent cortex was noted. In addition, multiple subcentimeter hypoechoic masses were observed with enhanced through transmission in the right breast (Fig. 1C). No lymphadenopathy was noted in the right axillary region. Bilateral breast MRI showed a lobular heterogeneous enhancing mass that involved almost the entire left breast, associated with marked edema and skin thickening (Fig. 1D–F). The right breast showed perioareolar skin thickening, and multiple enhancing masses (Fig. 1F). The differential diagnosis included bilateral inflammatory breast carcinoma, granulomatous mastitis, and bilateral breast lymphoma. PET-CT revealed marked hypermetabolism in the left breast and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, avid masses in the right breast (Fig. 1G). There was no evidence of involvement of other organs. Thereafter, core needle biopsies of right and left breast masses were performed under ultrasound guidance. Pathology revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving both breasts. The patient started chemotherapy with rituxan, methotrexate, and cytarabine. After 5 cycles of chemotherapy, the disease is currently in remission. On follow-up imaging, bilateral ultrasound showed residual areas of architectural distortion in both breasts. The prominent skin thickening previously noted in the left breast has resolved. No abnormal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was noted on follow-up PET-CT. "
3726,S0163-4453(11)00117-4,Chronic Pneumocystis jiroveci presenting as asymptomatic granulomatous pulmonary nodules in lymphoma," Discussion  Pneumocystis jiroveci is an important opportunistic pathogen in the immunocompromised host. 1  Typically P. jiroveci infection manifests histologically as a foamy intra-alveolar exudate and radiologically as diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates and the formation of small cysts, as seen on CT scanning. Clinical presentation tends to be acute with predominant symptoms of dyspnoea, fever, and non-productive cough developing over 3–5 days. The case presented demonstrates atypical features in each of these areas, in a subclinical process in this patient. Granulomatous P. jiroveci infection is an atypical histological manifestation reported in up to 5% of immunocompromised patients, predominantly in those with HIV/AIDS. 2  Including our case, it has been reported in only 15 cases of haematological malignancies to date. 3  Granuloma formation has been hypothesised to be determined by host factors, possibly due to a change in CD4+ lymphocyte numbers or function, however the actual mechanism has yet to be identified. 4  Granulomatous P. jiroveci is more frequently associated with atypical radiological manifestations, however even amongst these, solid nodules without evidence of accompanying infiltrates are rare. 5  Both solitary and multiple nodules have been reported, but rarely more than three. 6  This can be used as an aid to distinguish P. jiroveci from the differential diagnoses of lymphomatous and fungal nodules, which tend to be more numerous and can cavitate. Atypically our patient developed more than 30 nodules distributed with upper lobe predominance. The patient remained free from significant respiratory symptoms. This is highly unusual for P. jiroveci infection. In previously reported cases of chronic P. jiroveci all patients displayed typical symptoms during the course of the infection. 7–9  It has been hypothesized that the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-? by histiocytic cells may have a role in the morphogenesis of chronic productive P. jiroveci infection however this has yet to be confirmed. 8   In conclusion atypical manifestations of P. jiroveci infection are increasingly encountered presenting a difficult diagnostic challenge. Awareness of atypical clinical, radiological and histological presentations may lead to early consideration of this important differential in patients with immunological incompetence and pulmonary parenchymal disease.

Motor and sphincter function are detailed in Table 3 . All patients presented with neurological impairment, usually a mixed sensorimotor deficit. Back pain of variable duration (median 3 months; range: 3 days–18 months) preceded acute neurological presentation in 18 patients. 17 patients experienced sphincter disturbance at diagnosis; each had bladder dysfunction (requiring urethral catheterisation). 9 patients also had anal sphincter disturbance (lax sphincter tone on digital examination or faecal incontinence). Motor function was assessed retrospectively by case-sheet review and graded 1–4 as detailed in Table 3. A separate assessment of performance status was not made, given the importance of mobility in its estimation. At presentation 17 patients had grade 1–2 mobility whilst 8 patients had grade 3–4. Referral was in most instances via the regional neurosurgical centre (23 pts). Extradural spinal cord compression was confirmed radiologically in 12 patients using myelography; with or without computerised tomography (CT). In the remainder, the level of compression was determined by non-contrast assisted CT (2 pts) or spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (11 pts). The thoracic region was the most common disease site (17 cases). Other sites were cervical (2 pts), cervico-thoracic (1 pt), lumbar (4 pts), or sacral (1 pt). 16 patients underwent posterior laminectomy and tumour debulking, 2 undergoing a concomitant stabilisation procedure. 8 patients had spinal tumour biopsy alone. The remaining patient underwent cervical lymph node biopsy. No patient deteriorated neurologically in the immediate postoperative period.   2.2 Histopathological evaluation Histological sections from 20 cases for which archived material was available have been reviewed (JARN) and confirmation of lymphoid malignancy obtained in each. Further sub-classification of 9 of these cases was performed by one of several lymphoma pathologists who had also assessed the remaining five tumours. Histological grading was assessed using the working formulation (WF). Initial diagnostic material, whether obtained by surgical decompression or needle biopsy was frequently small in size and subject to crush artefact; these factors precluded accurate WF sub-classification of many of the diffuse lesions. Additional material obtained by lymph node biopsy in 5 cases produced a revision of diagnosis in 1 patient (initial biopsy suggesting an undifferentiated neoplasm, subsequently categorised as an intermediate grade NHL on review) and revision of WF grade (from intermediate to low-grade) in 2 cases. In 11 patients tumours were impossible to fully grade; these cases exhibited no features of low-grade disease and are included within the intermediate/high-grade tumour category for the purposes of analysis. Of the remaining 14 cases, 5 high-grade, 4 intermediate and 5 low-grade tumours were identified. Immunocytochemical studies using standard antibodies on paraffin sections were carried out in 24 cases; 18 cases displayed immunoreactivity with B-cell markers and 4 had immunophenotypic features of T-cell neoplasms; immunostaining was unhelpful in the remaining 2 cases.   2.3 Disease staging Disease staging was carried out using CT scanning and bone marrow biopsy. Cerebrospinal fluid was not routinely evaluated, but was negative in the 4 cases where it was sampled. No significant haematopoietic, renal or metabolic abnormalities were identified in any patients apart from 2 with a heavy disease burden, who had reduced serum albumin. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was not routinely measured. Antibody testing for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was not routinely performed, although 2 patients developed lymphoma as a sequelae to HIV infection. Tumour characteristics are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Tumours were localised in 13 cases and more widespread in the remainder. Local tumour extent was divided into four groups: (i) tumours of primary bone origin, causing vertebral destruction (4 pts); (ii) paravertebral tumours with extension into the spinal canal (3 pts); (iii) tumours with bony vertebral destruction and an associated paravertebral mass (9 pts); (iv) tumours with neither bone destruction nor a paravertebral mass (9 pts). 7 patients within this latter group had no disease demonstrable in other sites and thus had disease of primary extradural origin.   2.4 Treatment  2.4.1 Intermediate and high-grade tumours Treatment details are summarised in Tables 1 and 2. 16 patients (pts 1–16) with intermediate/high-grade disease were treated radically. 9 patients within this group initially received chemotherapy using either a 3-weekly cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone (CHOP) regimen (5 pts; median of four courses received: range: 2–6) or the vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisolone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide-bleomycin (VAPEC-B) combination, (4 pts, all completing 12 weeks) an alternating weekly regimen delivered in 12 courses [20]. 2 of these patients, both with high-grade stage 4 disease (bone marrow involvement), received additional dose-intense therapy following remission induction with VAPEC-B. Patient 13 (B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma) received high-dose methotrexate central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, followed by total body irradiation (TBI; 1440 cGy in 8 fractions over 4 days) and high-dose cyclophosphamide (3.6 g/m2) delivered with progenitor cell support. Patient 15 (high grade T cell tumour, with B symptoms), received three cycles of intrathecal methotrexate with VAPEC-B, followed by TBI and high-dose cyclophosphamide as above. Of the 7 other patients receiving initial chemotherapy, 5 patients received consolidation radiotherapy to the site of initial disease following a complete response to treatment. Doses (36–45 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy per fraction, using 4–6 MV photons) were prescribed at spinal cord depth in accordance with ICRU 50. The remaining 2 patients (pts 12 and 14) both had stage 4 disease at presentation and received chemotherapy only. 7 patients were treated initially with radiotherapy alone. This choice of treatment was based on doubts over individual patient tolerance of cytotoxics, although 2 patients (pts 2 and 16) subsequently received chemotherapy. The remaining 5 patients, (pts 1, 3, 6, 9 and 10, all with stage 1 disease) were treated exclusively with radiotherapy, each receiving 40 Gy in 20 fractions. 4 patients (pts 17–20), unfit for radical treatment, received palliative treatment only; 3 patients with extensive disseminated disease, total paraplegia and dual sphincter impairment received palliative spinal radiotherapy. All 3 patients died within 6 weeks of diagnosis. The fourth, an HIV positive male received palliative radiation and chemotherapy (vincristine and bleomycin).   2.4.2 Low-grade tumours 5 patients presented with low-grade disease (pts 21–25, detailed in Table 2). 3 patients with stage 1 disease received radical radiotherapy (32–40 Gy in 2–2.7 Gy per fraction). The remaining 2 patients had bone marrow involvement at diagnosis; 1 (pt 24) received six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy. The second, (pt 25) was treated with radiotherapy and chlorambucil. Both have received further local and systemic treatment in palliation.   "

3784,S0167-8140(99)00089-4,Radiotherapy in the management of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. Our experience in 25 cases," 2 Materials and methods From October 1978 to June 1997, we treated 31 patients with CBCL radiation therapy. Of these, 25 were included in this study because they were correctly staged and followed-up. Six patients were excluded from further analysis because upon final review of their cases, their histopathology was found not to be consistent with CBCL. There were 17 males and eight females, aged from 23 to 89 years (median age 50 years). All patients were previously submitted to skin biopsy, routine blood tests, chest X-ray and computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed as part of the staging evaluation. The mean follow-up time for the series was 3.9 years (range from 0.2 to 15 years) from the completion of radiation therapy. All patients were staged as follows: in group 1, single lesions; group 2, multiple lesions; group 3, disseminated lesions. There were six (24%) patients in group 1, 15 (60%) patients in group 2, and four (16%) in group 3. There were nine patients with head and neck lesions, 11 patients with trunk lesions, and five patients with leg lesions. A total of 25 patients were treated with radiation therapy. Thirteen patients (52%) had previously received chemotherapy for their CBCL (from two to six cycles). Ten patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), and three patients with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (COP). At the time of referral, all of these patients had suffered relapse of their CBCL. Whether to use extended field irradiation (EFI) or localized field irradiation (LFI) was determined by the local extent of disease involvement and the number of lesions: EFI was more likely to be chosen for extensive disease, whereas patients with few lesions usually received LFI. Extended field irradiation was used to treat disseminated lesions on the face, trunk, and upper and lower limbs. This technique which is the same or a modification of an irradiation technique our group previously described for the treatment of mycosis fungoides [10–14], was used to treat six patients (24%). We used 8 MeV electrons instead of a more preferable lower energy electron beam entirely for technical reasons. The eyes and the lips were protected with a small adapted lead shield, and the uninvolved areas of the scalp were protected by several thicknesses of lead. EFI of the trunk and upper limbs employed an 8-MeV electron beam attenuated to 4 MeV by the interposition of plastic plates to provide uniform dose distribution. Unlike the irradiation technique used to treat mycosis fungoides, we adapted standard plates to each patient rather than having plates custom made. EFI doses were delivered as follows: 30 Gy (four fractions of 2.5 Gy/week) [12]. LFI was used either as a boost after EFI or as definitive treatment. LFI was used to treat 19 patients (76%). Patients treated in this way mostly had isolated lesions. Energies of 45 kV X-ray filtered by 0.55 aluminium, were used for small depth lesions. Higher energies up to 100 kV were used for deeper lesions. A variety of applicator types and sizes were used (applicator diameter ranging from 1.5 to 20 cm). The radiation dose varied between 30 and 40 Gy (five fractions of 2 Gy/week). In all patients, a margin of at least 2.5 cm of healthy skin was included in the radiation field. There were three patients who benefited of hypofractionated radiotherapy because of age. Overall survival (Fig. 1) was calculated from the end of RT until the time of death from CBCL or related, secondary causes. Relapse-free survival was calculated from the time of completion of RT until the time of documented relapse. Disease-free survival (DFS) concerned only complete responders and was calculated from the time of documented complete remission until the date of documented relapse or death from CBCL. Progression-free survival was calculated from the time of completion of RT until the time of documented relapse or death. Curves were plotted by the Kaplan–Meier method [15] with statistical significance between individual curves. The patients with complete clinical disappearance of CBCL lesions were considered to have achieved a complete remission (CR); the treatment response was considered a partial remission (PR) if the lesion was reduced at least 50%; any reduction of less than 50% was considered as a non-response (NR). Skin tolerance was considered satisfactory if there was erythema (Grade I reaction), moderate reaction (Grade II), when there was dry epidermitis, severe reaction, with exudative epidermitis (Grade III), and/or ulceration or necrosis (Grade IV).

It is based at the Port Moresby General Hospital, the teaching hospital of the University of PNG and the only histology referral center for the whole country. From the records of tumour registry, all cases of head and neck lymphomas upto the age of 12 years, reported between 1986 and 1995 are included in this study. The histology slides were reviewed by two independent pathologists. Rappaport's classification was used in the original histopathology report. During this study the lymphomas were reclassified according to the 'Working Formulation' as it has a strong clinical bias, most commonly used and has some prognostic value. Wherever necessary the tissue blocks were recut, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and in selected cases special stains such as reticulin, methyl green pyronin and periodic acid schiff were also used. The clinical information of all these patients were obtained from the medical records section of Port Moresby General Hospital. The relevant treatment modalities and the follow up data were acquired from the National Cancer Center, Angau Memorial Hospital, Lae, which is the only referral Oncology set up for the country. "

Their mean age was 64.7 years (range 57-76 years). The system used in this study consisted of a light source (CLV-260SL; Olympus Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan), a processor (CV-260SL; Olympus), and a high-resolution magnification endoscope (GIFH260Z; Olympus). After insertion of the endoscope, duodenal lavage was conducted with 60 mL of water including a small amount of Gascon (0.04% solution of dimethicone; Kissei Pharmaceutical Inc, Tokyo, Japan) and Pronase MS (Kaken Pharmaceutical Inc, Tokyo, Japan) to remove mucus. Conventional endoscopy, magnified endoscopy with NBI, and magnified chromoendoscopy with crystal violet were conducted by experienced endoscopists (D.N., H.I.). Macroscopic patterns of follicular lymphoma were classified on conventional endoscopy, and the microsurface structure and microvascular patterns were investigated by magnified endoscopy with NBI and magnified chromoendoscopy with crystal violet. Macroscopic findings included the affected portion of the duodenum (bulb, second portion of the duodenum, third portion of the duodenum) and morphology (endoscopic macroscopic type, follicular limited type, or diffuse type). Magnified endoscopic findings included microsurface structure (abnormality of villi, presence of lymphoid follicles) and microvascular patterns (dilatation, swelling and irregularity of the microvessels, opaque white spots under the microvessels).

3850,S0165-4608(10)00257-8,A case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a neocentric inv dup(1)," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Case report A 66-year-old male, referred to the Medical Center Haaglanden (The Hague, the Netherlands), had a 1-month history of lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, progressive skin rash, and anemia. A pathologic diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) stage III was made, for which the patient was treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin (vincristine), and prednisone/prednisolone) in conjunction with anti-CD20 treatment because of a detectable Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) load in the blood and EBV positivity of the tumor. After three treatment cycles, a computed tomography scan showed an almost complete remission. To date, the treatment is still ongoing. Six years earlier, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) stage IIA of the testis was diagnosed in this patient. The DLBCL was treated with eight cycles CHOP, six cycles methotrexate (intrathecal), and hemicastration, which resulted in a complete remission. Unfortunately, no karyotyping was performed at the time of the first DLBCL diagnosis. Based on pathology results, the subsequent AITL was considered a new primary tumor.   2.2 Cytogenetic analysis The patient's bone marrow aspirate was counted using a Beckman Coulter AC ·T8 (Woerden, The Netherlands), and approximately 1×107 white blood cells were seeded in 10 mL medium and cultured at 37°C. Two different cell culture media were used: BioWhittaker Amniochrome PRO (Lonza, Belgium) was used for a 24-hour culture that was synchronized with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUDR) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX-I supplemented with 5% ?FCS, penicillin/streptomycin (all from GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), and 100 ng/mL phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate was used for an unsynchronized 96-hour culture. After Colcemid treatment, metaphases were harvested and GTG-banded according to standard protocols [12]. The karyotype was described according to ISCN 2009 [13].   2.3 Molecular cytogenetic analysis Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using DNA probes was performed according to a previously described method [14]. The following probes were used: whole chromosome paint 1 (WCP1; Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL), 1qter (clone name, GS-160H23), ?-satellite probe 1/5/19 (?-sat 1/5/19; Cytocell, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and the centromeric enumeration probe 1 (CEP1; Abbott Molecular).

3882,S0732-8893(11)00009-5,A fatal case with disseminated Myceliophthora thermophila infection in a lymphoma patient," 2 Discussion Fungi of the genus Myceliophthora are filamentous hyphomycetes which are saprophytic of soil and cosmopolitan. The species M. thermophila is characterized by abundant growth at elevated temperatures (42 °C). Although its hyphae appear hyaline, M. thermophila contains melanin in cell walls, as shown by black staining with the Masson–Fontana technique. This fungus should be considered as a dematiaceous (black mould) agent of phaeohyphomycosis. While M. thermophila has long been known as a pathogen of plants, it has only more recently been associated with fungal infections in humans. Five reported cases of human infection from North America and Europe have been published since 1992 (Bourbeau et al., 1992; Destino et al., 2006; Farina et al., 1998; Tekkok et al., 1996; Weitzel et al., 2009). Risk factors associated with this fungal infection appear to be immunosuppression, traumatic injury, and cardiac surgery. This pathogen seems to have a particular tropism for the cardiovascular system since, apart from the 2 injured patients (Destino et al., 2006; Tekkok et al., 1996), fungal vegetations were found each time in the heart and/or aorta. Two of the 5 patients died despite antifungal treatment by amphotericin B (Bourbeau et al., 1992; Farina et al., 1998). Clinical experience is limited regarding the treatment of these infections and there is no reliable data on its antifungal susceptibility sensitivity in vitro (Bourbeau et al., 1992; Destino et al., 2006). However, the activity of new azole molecules (voriconazole, itraconazole) appears promising (Ben-Ami et al., 2009). In our case, the fungus seemed to be resistant in vitro to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Starting treatment with caspofungin delayed 3 days of optimal management of the patient. This molecule was originally chosen because of possible Candida infection (positive serology), in a context rather suggestive of invasive aspergillosis, this antifungal being effective against these 2 pathogens.  Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia is an early marker of invasive aspergillosis which also contributed to delayed diagnosis for our patient. This false positivity can be explained by co-infection with Aspergillus spp., alimentation, and antibiotics of the beta-lactam family. The only beta-lactam received by the patient was ceftazidime, a synthetic molecule at low risk of cross-reaction. The most likely explanation is cross-reactivity with an analogous galactomannan constituting the dematiaceous cell wall, as it is already known for some other opportunistic fungi (Ben-Ami et al., 2010). Histological lesions of phaeohyphomycosis are similar regardless of etiologic agent and localisation. Central geographic or stellate foci of heterogeneous necrosis are observed, surrounded by giant cell granulomas and a dense collagenous capsule (Chandler and Watts, 1997). We observed in our case an association of both acute and chronic pathologic features. Acute invasive mycosis is characterized by vascular invasion, leading to thrombosis and infarction. These infarcts are centred by ischemic necrosis and surrounded by a parenchymal haemorrhagic rim, corresponding to the radiological ground-glass opacity (Watts and Chandler, 1997). The chronic nature of the lesions is represented by the giant cell granulomatous reaction. It was observed not only in the lungs but also around all secondary abscesses. This singular association can be explained by antifungal therapy, which reduced proliferation without eradicating the pathogen. Immunity restoration (after 35 days) contributed as well to restraining the fungus progression. Phaeoid hyphomycetes are environmental moulds that are increasingly found in invasive fungal infections in recent decades and mainly concern immunocompromised patients (Ben-Ami et al., 2009). These black moulds are characterized by production of melanin involved in fungal virulence (Gomez and Nosanchuk, 2003). Masson–Fontana staining can guide diagnosis and should be done at the slightest suspicion. In the case of M. thermophila, its pathogenic potential is exacerbated by its thermophilic nature and alleged angiotropism. This case highlights the difficulty of obtaining a rapid diagnosis for emerging opportunistic fungi and the need for an optimal collaboration among the clinical team, mycologists, and pathologists. These invasive fungal infections require early treatment to improve a dire prognosis in immunocompromised patients. "

Haemogram showed leukocytosis (WBC at 31.4 × 109/L with 48.0% blasts and 25.0% lymphocytes) and normal levels of haemoglobin and platelets. Microscopic examination revealed large atypical lymphocytes with a fine chromatin pattern and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 1 A). There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Abdominal ultrasound showed massive splenomegaly. Bone marrow aspirate showed numerous large atypical lymphocytes with similar morphology to that in the peripheral blood. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the marrow aspirate showed a mature B-cell phenotype with neoplastic cells expressing CD19 and CD20, and monotypic kappa light chain expression but not CD3, CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD23, CD43, CD103, or lambda light chain. Bone marrow trephine biopsy showed a diffuse infiltration of large lymphoid cells with frequent mitoses (Fig. 1B,C). The neoplastic cells expressed CD10, CD20 (Fig. 1D), bcl-2 (Fig. 1E), bcl-6, MUM1, and myc (Fig. 1F) with a high labelling index (90%) by Ki-67 immunostaining. Cyclin D1 and TdT were both negative. The marrow specimen was diagnosed as large B-cell lymphoma of germinal centre B-cell phenotype, and also a double-expressor lymphoma (positive for both bcl-2 and myc).

3925,S0165-4608(10)00142-1,Detection of a t(4;14)(p16;q32) in two cases of lymphoma showing both the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia," 2 Materials and methods  2.1 Patient 1 A 72-year-old female patient was diagnosed with B-lineage CLL in July 2004. She received chlorambucil and irradiation due to symptomatic splenomegaly. In June 2006, when samples were sent to the Munich Leukemia Laboratory for another evaluation, peripheral blood showed mild pancytopenia after therapy, whereas mature lymphocyte infiltration was found in the bone marrow with cytomorphology (Fig. 1 ). Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) identified a clonal B-cell population in 29% of all cells. The phenotype was typical for B-lineage CLL with aberrant coexpression of CD5 on the CD19+/CD20+ B-lymphocytes [CD22(+), CD23+, FMC7(+)]. The population showed light-chain lambda restriction and was positive for CD38 on 97% and for ZAP70 (zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70) on 99% of cells. CD79b, CD10, and TdT were negative. There was no increase of (CD138+, CD38+) plasma cells. Chromosome banding analysis revealed an unbalanced translocation of material from chromosome 8q to 16p (Fig. 2a), which was confirmed by multicolor FISH (Fig. 2b). With interphase FISH using the conventional CLL panel (6q, 11q, 12, 13q, 17p, and 14q), an IGH/14q32 rearrangement was shown. Analysis for the IGH-CCND1 and IGH-BCL2 (corresponding to the t(14;18)(q32;q21) in follicular lymphoma) revealed no rearrangement, but metaphase FISH with probes for the IGH locus and FGFR3 (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany), revealed an IGH-FGFR3 rearrangement (Fig. 2c). Thus, the following karyotype was determined in 16 metaphases analyzed: 46,XX,t(4;14)(p16;q32),del(8)(p11),der(16)t(8;16)(q23;p13). The corresponding t(4;14)(p16;q32) was confirmed with interphase FISH (using an LSI IGH/FGFR3 probe; Abbott) in 43/100 nuclei. There was an additional MYC signal in 40/100 nuclei, which is recurrently found in plasma cell myeloma [15] and B-CLL [16]. Hybridization of the MYC probe to metaphases revealed the additional MYC signal on the short arm of the derivative chromosome 16. The immunoglobulin gene status revealed 3% mutations and thus was, per definition, a mutated IGVH status [17]. In 2008, the patient received treatment according to the fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (FC) protocol with the achievement of partial remission. At the time of this report, 5 years after the initial diagnosis of the lymphoma, splenomegaly progressed again, while bone marrow infiltration was low. Cytotoxic treatment with bendamustin has been planned.   2.2 Patient 2 The second patient was diagnosed with B-CLL in 1996 at the age of 65 years. In 2004, he received treatment with fludarabine, followed by bendamustin/mitoxantrone/rituximab. In March 2008, when samples were investigated for the first time in the Munich Leukemia Laboratory, peripheral blood showed leukocytosis (WBC 30.7 × 109/L, Hb 14.3 g/dL; thrombocytes 78 × 109/L) with marked lymphocytosis (78% of all cells). With MFC, a clonal population of mature B-lymphatic origin was detected in 61% of cells. This population had the following phenotype: CD19+, CD5+, CD20+, CD22+, FMC7+, CD79b+, lambda(+), CD23–, CD10–, TdT–. ZAP-70 was negative. This corresponded to a diagnosis of CLL/PL (chronic lymphocyte leukemia/prolymphocyte leukemia). Interphase FISH with the conventional CLL panel revealed a trisomy 12 in 90/100 investigated interphase nuclei. Furthermore, an IGH rearrangement was detectable in 84/100 nuclei. Thus, karyotyping combined with metaphase FISH using probes flanking the breakpoints within the IGH locus and chromosome painting probes for chromosomes 4 and 14 (Fig. 2, d and e), determined the following karyotype in 11/20 metaphases: 47,XY,t(4;14)(p16;q32),+12 (Fig. 2f). With interphase FISH, the corresponding IGH-FGFR3 rearrangement was confirmed using an LSI IGH/FGFR3 probe (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany; Fig. 2g). To our knowledge, this is the first description of a t(4;14)(p16;q32) associated with lymphoma, with the morphology and the immunophenotype of B-CLL or small lymphocyte lymphoma (SLL), respectively. Other balanced translocations involving the IGH gene have been described previously in B-lineage CLL [18]. The identification of such rearrangements is facilitated by new culture techniques in B-CLL using oligonucleotides as stimulators of cell division [1]. With this technique, balanced translocations were detectable in 17–20% of B-CLL patients, and IGH/14q32 rearrangements in 5–8% of cases [1,5].  "

He had not seen a dentist for many years. Physical examination showed no lymphadenopathy or skin lesions, but he had paresthesia in the right infraorbital region. An intraoral examination revealed diffuse swelling with tenderness in the right maxillary buccal molar region, and his right canine had not erupted. His oral hygiene was relatively poor. He had a history of alcohol use and smoking tobacco daily. Routine blood tests and biochemical examinations were performed and revealed no alterations in blood count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and calcium. However, a serum antibody titer for HTLV-1 was extremely high, and his serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was significantly elevated (4,326 U/mL). Panoramic radiography showed a diffuse radiolucent lesion in the right maxilla, and it contained the root of an impacted canine (Fig. 1). Maxillofacial computerized tomography (CT) showed a diffuse bone-destructive mass in the anterior maxilla that infiltrated beyond the bony wall (Fig. 2). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a similar mass with muscle-like density in the T1-weighted image and a mass slightly denser than muscle in the T2-weighted image. Abdominal CT revealed several liver lesions, osteolytic changes in the vertebrae (L2 and L3), and lymphadenopathy around the jejunum. Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) revealed multiple uptakes of FDG in the right maxilla, right lung, liver, vertebrae, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes (Fig. 3).  An incisional biopsy was performed from the subcutaneous granulation-like tissue on the buccal side of the maxilla under local anesthesia, and the specimen was submitted for histologic and immunohistochemical examination. The hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections revealed diffuse proliferation of small and medium atypical lymphocytes. These tumor cells infiltrated into the fatty tissues and destroyed and replaced the existing tissue. There were some cells with large and very atypical nuclei (Fig. 4). Immunohistologically, CD3 (Fig. 5, a), CD4, CD43, and CD45R0 were positive, but CD8, CD20, CD56, CD79a, TdT, and TIA-1 were negative. Ki-67 was strongly immunopositive (Fig. 5, b). The patient was diagnosed with ATLL and referred to the Department of Hematology and Oncology of Okayama University Hospital. The patient was treated with 3 courses of cyclophosphamide 1,200 mg, adriamycin 80 mg, vincristine 2 mg, and prednisolone 100 mg (CHOP) chemotherapy. Although the abdominal lymphomas were reduced, the cheek tumor did not shrink, and flower cells appeared in the peripheral blood (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the right maxillary abscess recurred and was treated conservatively with local irrigation and periodontal currettage. Additionally, vindesine 4 mg, etoposide 160 mg × 3, carboplatin 400 mg, and prednisolone 60 mg (VECP) and mensa 1,200 mg × 3, ifosfamide 2 g × 3, mitoxantrone hydrochloride 12 mg, and etoposide 100 mg × 3 (MINE) chemotherapy was undertaken, plus local radiotherapy on the right maxilla (27 Gy). Subsequently, an umbilical cord blood transplant was performed with the previous treatment (etoposide 2.7 g × 2, cytarabine 8.2 g × 2, and total body irradiation 12 Gy). The transplant succeeded, but he developed an acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite steroid pulse therapy and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy, his general condition gradually worsened, and he died 7 months after his initial visit. "

MCL is a small-to-medium-sized lymphoma whose usual differential diagnosis includes small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and occasionally follicular lymphoma (FL). Definitive diagnosis of MCL is predicated on appropriate immunohistochemical staining with or without ancillary molecular and flow cytometric studies. Characteristic of MCL is the overexpression of cyclin D1 protein, a feature not seen in other similar-appearing lymphomas."
3942,S0167-5273(98)00136-3,A case of primary cardiac lymphoma: Utility of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor for noninvasive diagnosis," 2 Case report The patient was a 70-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital for the investigation of right-sided heart failure. She had complained of progressive shortness of breath for 6 months. An aspiration of pericardial effusion in the amount of 240 ml was carried out but her symptom was unchanged. The effusion was transudate and no malignant cells were found. On admission her heart rate was 104/min, blood pressure, 118/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate, 35/min and no heart murmur was heard. Generalized edema was noted. LDH (524 U/l) and sIL2r (2930 U/ml, normal range 246?742) were elevated. An echocardiogram (Fig. 1 ) and a thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a giant abnormal mass in the right atrium and ventricle which obstructed the right ventricular inflow tract. A gallium scan was positive in the right side of the heart but no abnormal uptake was detected outside of the heart. A transvenous endomyocardial biopsy was unsuccessful. The patient was administered 40 mg of prednisolon and temporal improvement of heart rate and reduction in LDH was noted. Based on the partial effectiveness of steroid treatment and elevation of sIL2r, the tentative diagnosis of cardiac lymphoma obstructing the right heart was made. Radiation therapy was started, but one day after the initial irradiation, the patient died of intractable cardiogenic shock. Postmortem examination revealed replacement of the right cardiac wall with malignant lymphoma. An intracardiac tumor was identified in the right atrium (6 cm in diameter) and right ventricle (7 cm) (Fig. 2 ). Thorough examination of the entire body showed no lymphoma except for a small paraaortic lymphnode, 5 mm in diameter, in which lymphoma cells were identified. The histopathological diagnosis of cardiac B cell lymphoma was made based on positive staining by a leukocyte common antigen and a B-cell marker, and negative staining by a T-cell marker. "
3943,S0196-0709(08)00087-2,A case of nasal natural killer/T lymphoma revealed by repeated deep neck abscess," 2 Case report A 62-year-old man presented to our hospital with complaints of nasal pain and bleeding. There were crusts on the bilateral inferior turbinates. Computed tomographic (CT) scan imagings showed mild sinusitis and no destruction of the bony structure of the sinuses. After 2 weeks of taking oral antibiotics of clarithromycin, he presented with a severe sore throat. His white blood cell count was 9400/?L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 11.02 mg/dL. Because of difficulty in eating, he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous drip of antibiotics (panipenem/betamipron, 2 g 2 times per day, and clindamycin, 1200 mg 2 times per day). He recovered and was discharged with improved crusts in the nasal cavity. Almost 1 year after the first visit to our hospital, he presented to his local physician with marked swelling and pain in the right lateral cervical region. Although treated for 2 weeks with intravenous dripping of antibiotics (meropenem, 1 g/d, and minomycin, 200 mg/d), the cervical swelling remained unchanged, and he was referred to our hospital. Result of the physical examination showed a firm and tender mass on the right side of the submandibular area. All the organs in the oral cavity and pharynx were normal. Nasal examination revealed crusts on the bilateral inferior tubinates, which was the same as had been seen 1 year before. Other results of physical examination were unremarkable. A peripheral white blood cell count was 7600/?L, and CRP was 11.88 mg/dL. The CT scan imagings of the head and neck showed a fluid-containing area with ring enhancement at the right submandibular region adjacent to the submandibular gland and sternocleidomastoid muscle (Fig. 1 ). He was diagnosed with a deep neck abscess, and cervical drainage and tracheostomy were performed under general anesthesia immediately because the edematous condition around the larynx was highly suspected. A drain was placed out from the wound for 10 days. Considering the possibility of anaerobic infection in the abscess, empirical treatment with meropenem (1000 mg 2 times per day), penicillin G, and clindamycin (1200 mg 2 times per day) was started at the same time. After methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sepsis was isolated, these 3 antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient was placed on teicoplanin (200 mg 2 times per day) and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (600 mg 2 times per day). After 2 weeks, until when his fever lasted higher than 37°C, we confirmed complete resolution of the abscess. The results brought during this time were negative findings in blood cultures; negative serologic test results for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, or HIV; and normal chest radiograph and abdominal CT scan. His laboratory data indicated mild renal failure, and considering the possibility of Wegener's granuloma, serologic tests for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were done, which had negative results. The cause of slight fever and renal failure remained unclear. One month later, his clinical condition improved, and the patient was discharged. Five months passed before the patient returned to our hospital. He presented with repeated swelling and pain in the left parotid region. The physical examination revealed a firm and tender mass on the left side of the parotid area. The palatine tonsils and velar showed red porpoises, and crusts on the bilateral inferior turbinated were unchanged. Laboratory data showed a peripheral white blood cell count of 9.1 × 109/L and CRP, 4.68 mg/dL. A CT scan of the head and neck showed the formation of an abscess in the right parotid region (Fig. 2 ). He underwent cervical drainage under local anesthesia. No bacteria were isolated in the pus. After 8 days of treatment with meropenem (500 mg 2 times per day) and clindamycin (600 mg 2 times per day), the abscess in the parotid gland was improved. Although in the hospital, he also complained of a sore throat, and inflammatory products were found on his reddened tonsils. After 1 month treatment in the hospital, he recovered and was discharged. Repeated infections in the head and neck region led us to consider that the patient was having an immunodeficiency disease. Therefore, he underwent biopsy of the tonsil and inferior turbinates. Histopathologic examination of the tonsil showed chronic inflammation, whereas that of the inferior turbinates showed abnormal lymphocytes with pleomorphic nuclei and a more atypical and typical mitoses in a background of diffuse and dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils (Fig. 3 ). Immunohistochemistry was positive for T-cell marker (CD3) but not for a B-cell marker (CD19). An immunohistochemistry marker for NK cells (CD56) was positive. Thus, based on the clinical picture, histopathologic examination, and immunohistochemistry, we finally came to a diagnosis of extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The patient was started on multidrug chemotherapy, called the CAMBO-VIP regimen consisting of injections of doxorubicin, methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, ifosfamide, and prednisolone. He achieved complete remission and there are no signs of recurrence after treatment for 5 years. "
3961,S0303-8467(11)00268-X,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): An unusual primary manifestation of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma," 2 Case report  2.1 Clinical history A 53-year old Caucasian male was submitted to the neurological emergency department at Rostock University with a first generalized convulsive seizure. The patient's history included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On admission, physical examination was unremarkable, a moderate psychomotor slowing was considered as being a postictal symptom. Blood pressure was 150/90mmHg, heart rate 90bpm and body temperature 36.9°C. Neither enlarged lymph nodes nor hepatosplenomegaly was observed. The patient suffered from increasing exhaustion and from diffuse back pain during the last weeks. One week prior to admission, the patient had presented at another emergency department where a psychogenic pain syndrome was diagnosed.   2.2 Clinical investigations Initial laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9mmol/L and a platelet count of 195Gpt/L, leukocyte count was 7.15Gpt/L. Elevated serum levels were detected for creatinine (438?mol/L), urea (19.8mmol/L) and total calcium (3.8mmol/L). Serum C-reactive protein and cerebrospinal fluid testing were normal. T2-weighted cerebral MRI revealed bilateral hyperintense lesions in the occipital white matter, most likely corresponding to vasogenic edema (Fig. 1A). Few hours after admission, further convulsive seizures occurred and were successfully treated by administration of clonazepam. Nevertheless, the patient's level of consciousness deteriorated to a stuporous state and he was transferred to the neurological intensive care unit for further monitoring and therapy. Repeated cerebral MRI scans showed a progress of the T2-hyperintense white matter changes that were expanding towards the brain stem and both parietal and frontal lobes in a symmetrical manner (Fig. 1B). Additionally, areas of restricted diffusion in the cortical areas next to the subcortical edema were seen (Fig. 1C). Laboratory workup performed to elucidate the cause of the observed hypercalcemia, including repeated peripheral full blood counts, serum and urine electrophoresis, immunofixation and free light chain quantification as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), parathormone and parathormone-related peptide, yielded unremarkable results. CT of chest and abdomen demonstrated multi-locular osteolytic lesions in the vertebral column and the pelvic bone (Fig. 1F), but enlarged lymph nodes or any other tumor mass were absent. Thus, a bone marrow biopsy and cytology, as well as a CT-guided biopsy of an osteolytic lesion were obtained. Both, biopsies and the aspirates, showed neoplastic blastic lymphoid cells. In the biopsies the cells packed the marrow spaces (Fig. 2A and B). On immunohistochemistry tumor cells were CD20-positive and CD79a-positive; but immunoreactions for CD10, bcl-6, CD5, cyclin D1, CD34, TdT, VS38c, and myeloperoxidase remained negative. Nuclear Ki-67-index was well above 50%. Based on these morphologic findings a diagnosis of DLBCL without further specification (DLBCL-NOS) could be made. In addition, foci of discrete but indisputable osteoclastic bone resorption were observed that in the absence of clinical evidence for any other alternative cause provided a good explanation for the hypercalcemia.   2.3 Treatment and outcome A PRES was diagnosed based on the clinical and cerebral MRI findings [1,2]. Treatment was initiated with diuretic therapy and bisphosphonates. After a short time, retention parameters and serum calcium started to decline, the MRI changes slowly resolved and the level of consciousness improved. Cortical blindness with anosognosia (Anton's syndrome) was present for a few days. Consecutively, residual neuropsychological impairment with leading alexia and agraphia was observed and resolved during the following six weeks (Fig. 3A and B). While the staging examinations of DLBCL were performed, LDH rapidly increased from 244 up to 895U/L. Therefore, a prephase treatment with prednisolone and vincristine was initiated, followed by six cycles of chemotherapy according to the current protocol of the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) study group for non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the B-cell type (B-NHL). A synopsis of this protocol can be retrieved from the following website: http://www.leukemia-net.org/trial/en/detail_trial.html?id=12. Application of chemotherapy occurred in three different courses of 21–28 days duration followed by a repetition of these three courses. After the first course of chemotherapy the bone marrow was free of the initially diagnosed blastic lymphoid cells. Six weeks after the initial cerebral imaging, a repeated cerebral MRI scan showed a nearly complete regression of T2-hyperintense lesions (Fig. 1D). The only residual finding was a small hyperintense lesion on T1-weighted images, localized in the cortex of the left occipital lobe, corresponding to a minor bleeding (Fig. 1E).  "

His symptoms of sleep apnoea completely resolved following the first cycle of chemotherapy. Similarly, after his treatment began, his weight rapidly rebounded to his appropriate pre-diagnosis percentile for his age and sex. His weight loss prior to diagnosis was attributed to the constitutional symptoms associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and the general catabolic state of malignancy."

3998,S0264-410X(09)01311-5,Risk of lymphoma and leukaemia after bacille Calmette-Guérin and smallpox vaccination: A Danish case-cohort study," 2 Materials and method  2.1 Research strategy To explore the possible association between BCG and smallpox vaccination and morbidity and mortality in the Danish population, we have linked the vaccination data from the Copenhagen Municipal Archives of School Health Records with the Danish registers for hospitalisations and specific chronic diseases. We have focused on a cohort experiencing the out-phasing of these vaccines because logistic factors rather than parental choice determined vaccination status and it is therefore possible to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in a relatively unbiased manner. Vaccination data from the period of out-phasing in Denmark is only available from Copenhagen Municipal Archives of School Health Records. In the examination of specific chronic diseases, we searched for all the cases in the archive and compared their vaccination status with the vaccination status of a representative sample of the cohort. Which chronic conditions could be examined is linked to the size of the cohort and the age of onset of the disease. For example, malignant melanoma [16] cannot yet be examined in the present cohort due to later onset. Among the cancers, lymphoma and leukaemia were the largest group with early onset and we have therefore first examined the link with this group [44].   2.2 Study population The present study was based on the Copenhagen School Health Records Register (CSHRR), which contains computerised information from 350,445 school health records of children born between 1930 and 1983 and who attended public and private primary schools in the municipality of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. CSHRR contains name, sex, birth weight, and information from mandatory health examinations about height, weight, and date of examination [45]. Since 1968, unique central person registration numbers (CPR numbers) have been assigned to all citizens of Denmark and is available in CSHRR for children attending school from 1968 and onwards [45,46]. Information about other health-related conditions and illnesses along with information about vaccinations and general information about the child and the family was retrievable from the original school health records stored in the Copenhagen Municipal Archives [45] and it was computerised for the individuals sampled for the present study. The information on BCG and smallpox vaccination was double entered and inconsistencies were corrected. In Denmark it was mandatory to receive smallpox vaccination free of charge before school entry until April 1st, 1977 [20]. Smallpox vaccination could be administered at any age before school entry; thus, some individuals from the same birth year would have been smallpox-vaccinated before the discontinuation whereas others would not have been smallpox-vaccinated. BCG vaccination was offered free of charge on a voluntary basis and usually performed by school medical officers shortly after school entry at age seven years [21,47]. BCG vaccination was gradually out-phased during the 1980s and finally discontinued in 1985 [21,48]. Thus both BCG and smallpox vaccinations were gradually phased out for individuals born in 1965–1976. The present study was a case-cohort study based on the background cohort of 47,622 individuals who belonged to the birth cohorts of 1965–1976 and was registered in CSHRR. Using CPR numbers, CSHRR was linked to the Danish Cancer Registry, which is a population-based register containing all cancers occurring in the Danish population since 1943 [49]. By use of International Classification of Diseases, Seventh Revision codes (ICD-7 codes), we identified all cases above 5 years of age from the background cohort with a diagnosis of leukaemia (n =24, ICD-7 codes: 204.0–204.4; 214.0–214.1; 404.0–404.4), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n =27, ICD-7 codes: 201.0–201.1) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n =28, ICD-7 codes: 198.0; 200.0–200.4; 202.0; 740.1–799.9). Information on emigration and death was obtained through linkage to the Danish Civil Registration System. Individuals were followed until relevant cancer diagnosis (leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), emigration, death, or last available update of the Danish Cancer Registry (December 31st, 2003) whichever event occurred first. In order to assess the vaccination status in the background cohort in which the cases were identified, we used a subcohort of 2391 individuals, which was selected within the background cohort by randomly sampling 5% within strata of birth year and sex.  Fig. 1  presents an overview of inclusion and exclusion of individuals from the subcohort and among cases. Individuals were excluded if CPR numbers were missing or invalid, if their school health record (and thereby information on vaccination and confounders) was missing, if there was no observation time, or if information about either BCG or smallpox vaccination was lacking. In the analyses we included 2,073 individuals from the subcohort, 20 cases of leukaemia, and 51 cases of lymphoma of whom 24 had Hodgkin's lymphoma and 27 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Three cases were also part of the subcohort, which was sampled irrespective of the case status. Analyses of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were conducted both separately and combined.   2.3 Exposure information Information about smallpox vaccination, BCG vaccination, and potential confounders were originally filled out by the school medical officers, usually in connection with the first health examination at school entry at approximately five to seven years of age [45]. The school medical officers routinely gathered the information about vaccinations from the pupil's standardised vaccination card on which all vaccinations are recorded [20]. Individuals were regarded as smallpox and/or BCG-vaccinated if this was indicated either by a date, a “yes”, or a plus sign in the field for the respective vaccines on the school health record. Individuals were regarded as BCG-unvaccinated if this was indicated on the record or if the field for BCG vaccination was left empty and the record contained information related to BCG vaccination such as parental consent for BCG vaccination or results of tuberculin skin test. The registration of such information indicate some action and consideration of BCG status and thus it is most likely that a missing registration of BCG vaccination indicates “no vaccination” rather than a failed registration which is most likely if all the fields related to BCG and tuberculin status were left empty. Thus, for example, a child was considered unvaccinated if the BCG field was empty and there was a note of parental consent or tuberculin skin test irrespective of whether consent was given or tuberculin skin test was positive or negative. Individuals were regarded as smallpox-unvaccinated if this was indicated on the record or if the field for smallpox vaccination was left empty while there was information about other vaccinations (excluding BCG, since this vaccine was usually administered after school entry). Potential confounders considered in the analyses were sex, birth year (one-year groups), birth weight (?2500g, 2501–3999g, ?4000g and unknown/uncertain), number of siblings (none, 1, 2 or more, and unknown), other recommended childhood vaccinations (all, at least one, and unknown/uncertain/refusal), and day care attendance before school entry (yes, no, and unknown) along with family social class (I (highest) to V (lowest) and non-classifiable) [23,26,28,40,50]. Family social class was coded as the highest individual social class of the parents obtained through information on the parents’ occupation and/or education at school entry of the child [51]. The non-classifiable group included unemployed, housewives, students, and individuals with uncertain or unknown occupation information. Since HIV is a well-known risk factor for lymphoma [44], cases of HIV were identified through linkage to the Danish National Patient Register.   2.4 Statistical analysis Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards model with age as the underlying time scale, delayed entry at date of first school health examination, and with BCG and smallpox vaccination as time-varying variables. Due to an assumed latency period for cancer detection, individuals did not change BCG and smallpox vaccination status in the analysis until three years after the respective vaccine was received. All other variables were time-fixed since they only included information pertaining to the time before school entry and thus before follow-up began. Due to the case-cohort design, we used Prentice pseudo likelihood function to estimate the parameters of the Cox proportional hazards model [52], so that cases outside the subcohort only were included in the risk set at their own failure time, but not at the failure time of other cases. Also, we used robust variance estimation to avoid underestimation of the variance [53]. The analyses were stratified by birth year and sex to account for the stratified sampling [54]. Wald test statistics were used to examine the association between BCG and smallpox vaccination, respectively, and each diagnosis of leukaemia, lymphomas combined, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The significance of interactions was also determined by Wald test statistics. The potential confounders birth weight, other childhood vaccinations, family social class, number of siblings, and day care attendance were included in the model if their inclusion changed the estimates of interest by more than 10%. Additional analyses were done with exclusion of HIV cases and different latency periods. All analyses were performed in Stata version 9.2.  "
4011,S1529-1839(10)00107-7,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with multiple cranial nerve deficits," Case description  Ophthalmic evaluation A 50-year-old black man presented to the clinic with complaints of vertigo and decreased vision in the left eye for the prior week. The patient denied diplopia but reported left eye pain in left gaze. The patient's ocular history was significant for being a glaucoma suspect. His medical history was significant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diagnosed approximately 9 years earlier, which spontaneously resolved after 3 years without treatment. The patient was lost to follow-up with hematology and had not been examined in the previous 5 years. Additionally, the patient presented to the urgent care clinic 1 month prior complaining of right facial pain and numbness as well as decreased taste on the right side of the tongue for 3 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at the urgent care visit was nondiagnostic, and the patient was discharged and instructed to follow up with neurology. The patient's social history was remarkable for cocaine use and alcohol abuse, with a recent episode of alcohol-related pancreatitis. He denied using alcohol or drugs within the prior 6 months despite testing positive for cocaine 3 months earlier. On examination, visual acuities with spectacle correction were 20/20?2 in the right eye (O.D.) and 20/50 in the left (O.S.). Pinhole visual acuity was 20/40?2 O.S. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light without an afferent pupillary defect. Ishihara color plate testing was full O.D. and O.S. Extraocular motilities were full O.D., but abduction O.S. was limited, and the patient reported pain on movement. Cover test at distance showed orthophoria in primary gaze. There were no signs of nystagmus. Anterior segment examination was within normal limits in both eyes (OU). Intraocular pressure measured 18 mmHg OU. The dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable, with cup-to-disc ratios of 0.25 horizontal/vertical OU. The optic nerves had distinct margins and no signs of pallor or edema (see Figure 1 ). Humphrey visual field 24-2 SITA-fast (Carl Zeiss Ophthalmic Systems, Inc., Dublin, California) was clear O.D. but revealed an inferior altitudinal defect O.S. (see Figure 2 ). The findings of unexplained reduced visual acuity and visual field loss O.S. (cranial nerve II), abduction deficit in the left eye (cranial nerve VI), coupled with a recent history of facial numbness and pain (cranial nerve V) and taste loss of the right half of the tongue (cranial nerve VII or IX), suggested multiple cranial nerve involvement. These findings prompted us to immediately refer the patient to the neurology department, where the patient was admitted for further testing. A differential diagnosis for multiple cranial neuropathies included a lymphoproliferative process with CNS involvement, possibly related to the previous CLL diagnosis. Carcinomatous meningitis, which entails diffuse infiltration of malignant cells from a primary solid tumor to the leptomeninges (a meningeal layer composed of the pia and arachnoid mater), was ruled out with a complete computed tomography (CT) body scan. Neurosarcoidosis was ruled out based on normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, absence of hilar lymphadenopathy on chest CT, and absence of granulomatous masses on MRI. Other considerations included multiple sclerosis and giant cell arteritis, both of which were low in the differential diagnoses. The pain with abduction of the left eye was not consistent with a retrobulbar optic neuritis, which typically demonstrates an afferent pupillary defect, dyschromatopsia, and optic nerve enhancement on MRI. Neurologic examination found bilateral facial parasthesias with tactile hypersensitivity. Additionally, the patient showed a right-sided hemiparesis predominately affecting the leg as well as loss of taste; further questioning elicited a recent history of frontal headaches. The gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain, interpreted by the radiologist, showed diffuse thickening of the leptomeninges with enhancement of the third, fifth, eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth cranial nerves (see Figure 3 ). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation from a lumbar puncture showed lymphocytosis, and flow cytometry confirmed a diagnosis of large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient's previous diagnosis of CLL was now thought to be a low-grade lymphoma that either progressed or transformed to a more aggressive type involving the CNS. Once the diagnosis was confirmed, the patient was started immediately on intrathecal chemotherapy. Subsequently, the visual field loss in the left eye improved; however, the patient's neurologic status declined steadily, and he died 2.5 years after his initial diagnosis.  "
4021,S0022-202X(15)34748-5,IRF4 Gene Rearrangements Define a Subgroup of CD30-Positive Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma: A Study of 54 Cases," Results  Patients and samples Sixty-seven samples were analyzed by FISH corresponding to skin (n=49, 7Ly, 11 T-MF and 31 C-ALCL), blood (n=13, 13 SS), node (n=4, 4 C-ALCL), or bone marrow (n=1, 1 T-MF) material. Sixty samples were informative and matched to 54 patients: 23 C-ALCL, 11 T-MF, 13 SS, and 7 LyP. Patients presented with either C-ALCL alone (n=18), C-ALCL with regional lymph node involvement at the time of sampling (n=5), T-MF (n=11), de novo SS (n=10), or secondary SS (n=3) (SS preceded by T-MF). Among the 11 patients with T-MF, 8 were CD30 positive (more than 50% of large cells) and 3 were CD30 negative.   6p25-specific locus FISH analysis We observed three types of FISH pattern (Figure 1 ): normal pattern with two fusions (2F) (Figure 3d ); split patterns with one fusion, one red, one green (1F-1R-1G), or 2F+1G extra signal (Figure 2a ); and extra copies pattern of nonrearranged IRF4 locus (more than 2F) (Figures 1b, 2b and c). As summarized in Table 1 , we observed a normal FISH pattern in 40 patients (74%). A monoallelic split pattern suggesting IRF4 translocation was found in 8 out of 54 patients (14.8%) and extra copies of the IRF4 locus were observed in 6 out of 54 cases (11.2%). All cases exhibiting an IRF4 abnormal pattern are presented in Table 2 .    IRF4 locus rearrangements Among 54 CTCLs, we identified 8 CTCLs (14.8%) with a split signal pattern (Figure 2a) suggesting an IRF4 break point: 6 out of 23 C-ALCLs (26%) and 2 out of 11 T-MF (18.2%). The percentages of nuclei with split signal ranged from 31 to 88% (Tables 1 and 2). In most cases (6 of 8), the split signal was 1F-1R-1G, with a break point lying between the 3? end of CTD-2308G5 and the 5? end of RP11-164H16 BAC probes, suggesting the existence of a major breakpoint region, spanning almost 130kb. Two patients carrying rearrangements (one C-ALCL and one T-MF, cases 1 and 8, Table 2) showed a particular FISH pattern: A 2F signal with a green extra signal, indicating that the break point maps within the region hybridizing to the 3? IRF4-flanking BAC probe (RP11-164H16). In case 1, FISH analysis was also performed on skin tumor cell metaphases. In this sample, the 3? IRF4-flanking probe extra signal was observed on 6q (Figure 2d–f), in accordance with the previously published G-banded tumor karyotype of skin tumor cells showing inv(6)(p23;q15) (Chevret et al., 2006). Interestingly, the two T-MF cases with IRF4 rearrangements were CD30 positive, whereas no split was observed in CD30-negative T-MF, SS, or LyP cases. Probe validation on metaphases from healthy cells was performed as a prerequisite before patient analysis. Because of false-positive extra signals corresponding to nonspecific hybridization 16p of BAC clones RP11-119L15, CTD-2314K17, and CTD-3052J12 these probes were discarded.   Extra copies of nonrearranged 6p25 or IRF4 locus Extra copies of the IRF4 locus without a split signal were found in 4 out of 13 SS (30.8%), 1 out of 11 T-MF (9.9%), and 1 out of 23 C-ALCL (4.3%) cases (Table 1). In 13 SS cases analyzed on cytogenetic preparations obtained from blood samples, three exhibited a three fusion (3F) signal pattern (Figure 2b), suggesting either a gain of one IRF4 locus or chromosome 6 trisomy. One T-MF case also exhibited such a signal pattern (3F), and one C-ALCL showed four fusion (4F) signals. We did not detect any extra copies of the IRF4 locus in LyP cases. Furthermore, no signal loss of the IRF4 locus was observed both in cases with or without an IRF4 rearrangement, indicating that IRF4 rearrangements are balanced and more generally the absence of IRF4 deletion.   Clinical data Among six C-ALCL cases carrying IRF4 rearrangements, two patients had node involvement at the time of biological sampling, and two other patients had a cutaneous relapse during follow-up. None of these patients had lymph node involvement after follow-up; and all are alive with complete remission. Conversely, three patients without IRF4 rearrangements had lymph node involvement at the time of the study and three other patients without an IRf4 rearrangement had regional node progression (data not shown).   FISH combined with immunofluorescence Skin sections of three C-ALCL cases with IRF4 break point were analyzed by FISH, combined with immunofluorescence (IRF4 locus-specific FISH, followed by CD30 immunostaining). In case 1, 100 cells were analyzed and 74% were found to be CD30 positive (Figure 2g and h). Eighty-three percent of cells expressing the CD30 antigen also exhibited a split signal pattern, indicating an IRF4 locus translocation, and none of the CD30 negative cells harbored an IRF4 break point (Figure 2h). We also detected CD30-positive cells (17%) that displayed a normal FISH pattern (Figure 2i). Similar results were found in two other patients (cases 3 and 4) but only 24 and 17 cells, respectively, could be analyzed. Altogether, FISH, followed by immunofluorescence, showed that most CD30-positive cells exhibited an IRF4 rearrangement, but a subset of CD30-positive cells had a normal FISH pattern.   IRF4 or MUM1 immunostaining Different CTCL subtypes were found to express the IRF4 protein, although at variable levels, as shown in Table 3  and Figure 3. However, no difference in IRF4 immunostaining was observed between C-ALCL, LyP, and T-MF subgroups. All C-ALCL cases with an IRF4 locus rearrangement showed IRF4 expression (six of six), but one out of two T-MF cases carrying the IRF4 break point showed IRF4 protein expression in only 10–50% of tumor cells. IRF4 immunostaining was found in >85% of tumor cells in four C-ALCL cases with IRF4 rearrangement, the two others showed IRF4 expression in 50–85% of tumor cells. Nevertheless, IRF4 immunostaining was not correlated with IRF4 locus status as determined by FISH: 23 out of 24 patients (12 C-ALCL, 7 LyP, 4 T-MF) without an IRF4 genomic abnormality were found positive (more than 10% of cells). Furthermore, in LyP cases, IRF4 was expressed by >85% of CD30-positive large cells in six out of seven cases.   Array-CGH profile The chromosome 6 array-CGH profile was determined for 11 patients with C-ALCL, for 7 patients with T-MF, as well as for 11 patients with SS. Eight of these patients were found to exhibit an IRF4 locus abnormality (Table 2). However, the array-CGH profile did not show any specific IRF4 or chromosome 6p imbalance in cases with (n=5, 4 C-ALCL and 1 T-MF) or without (n=24) an IRF4 break point. In one SS case (case 11) with one extra copy of the IRF4 locus, as determined by FISH (3F detected in 90% nuclei analyzed), the array-CGH profile showed a 6p22–p25 gain, encompassing the IRF4 locus. In two other patients with SS (cases 12 and 14), extra copies of the IRF4 locus were detected by FISH in only 22 and 21% nuclei, which is below the detection threshold of our array-CGH technique. Moreover, in the T-MF case with one extra copy of the IRF4 locus detected in 91% nuclei analyzed (case 10), no chromosome 6 gain was observed by array-CGH, suggesting a global aneuploidy.   FISH analysis of chromosome 6 and ploidy As shown in Table 4 , six cases with extra copies of the IRF4 locus were further analyzed with other FISH probes. In the patient with C-ALCL (case 7) and in two patients with SS (case 11 and 13), only the 6p region exhibited two and one extra copies, respectively. For case 11, these data were in accordance with array-CGH data showing 6p22–6p25 gain. In three other patients (cases 10, 12, and 14), the extra copies of the IRF4 locus were found to be a consequence of polyploidy, as shown in Table 4.  "
4033,S0399-8320(10)00349-0,"Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: A review on clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapeutic strategies and perspectives"," Background In 1855, Sir W. Gull made the first observation of a syndrome-like association between malabsorption and lymphoma [17]. Sometime later, in 1962, CD was found to be the cause of this malabsorption, carrying the risk of malignant transformation [18]. In 1978, the disease was defined as a “malignant histiocytosis of the intestine”, with a histological description already very close to that currently used of infiltrating more or less stenosing and perforating involvement of the intestine by a polymorphic large cell NHL, sometimes occurring with eosinophil infiltrates and frequently with mesenteric lymph nodes involvement [19–21]. In 1985, Isaacson et al. [22] showed the T phenotype of this lymphomatous proliferation, long overshadowed by the intestinal NHL group, designated “intestinal T-cell lymphoma” (with or without enteropathy) in the Revised European-American Lymphoma classification (REAL classification) [23–25]. Its origin in intraepithelial T-lymphocytes (IELs) of the intestinal mucosa was then recognised due to the HML1 immunostaining, currently named CD103, specifically distinguishing it from the other peripheral T-cell NHL [26]. EATL was only finally clearly identified later as part of the WHO classification of lymphomas in 2001. It was designated “enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma” (ETCL), and then changed to the current designation of EATL in the more recent 2008 version [1,2,9,23,27]. It is in fact a separate T-cell NHL, as much in terms of its pathophysiology as in its progression and its prognosis. More recently, refractory celiac disease (RCD) 2 was described as being a low-grade lymphoma restricted to the intraepithelial compartment that could be complicated by a more aggressive, more invasive and classic form of EATL [4,16,28]. Although the links of continuity between these transitional forms have now been well documented, it does not appear that RCD2 is an obligatory step. "
